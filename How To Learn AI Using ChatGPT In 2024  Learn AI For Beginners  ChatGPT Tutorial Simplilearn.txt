whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back just a quick info guys simply learn
has got a postgraduate program in Ai and
machine learning in collaboration with
per University you can boost your career
with this AI ml course in this course
you're going to learn the in demand
skills such as machine learning deep
learning NLP computer vision
reinforcement learning generative AI
prompt engineering Chad GPT and many
more hurry up join the course link the
course is mentioned in the description
box so guys let's start with learning AI
using Chad GPD so our first prompt is
going to be let us ask GPT hey GPD can
you give me road map for learning
AI for 10
months weekly wise
and also
add the respective topics weekly
wise now guys this is a prompt which I
want you to also type because you are
going to get a road map from first month
to 10th month and you also going to get
a syllabus kind of a stuff and also for
better Clarity you can ask day Wise Road
map also for the first month I can also
give a prompt something like this that
gbd please give day
wise plan for month
one so if you say something like this so
it say on day one it is going to tell
you that you have to read about what is
artificial intelligence or you can ask
for articles or videos regarding the
concept of AI so this thing you're going
to get it from YouTube or various
learning sources is present on the web
and next thing you have to familiarize
yourself with the history and evolutions
of AI moving ahead you have to
understand on day two what are the types
of AI you will learn about narrow Ai and
general AGI you also going to explore
the examples of AI applications so
suppose now I want to give this prompt
okay suppose for day one I want to learn
about it so you can just directly give
this question all over here and you can
see chat GPD is going to generate the
definition now first thing is let us try
to understand are we able to understand
this or not so say I asked gbt what is
artificial intelligence suppose I'm a
very beginner and I'm starting very new
to this field so I have asked this
question now you can see chat GPT has
explained something like this artificial
intelligence refers to the simulation of
human intelligence in machines that are
programmed to think learn and problem
solve like humans this field incompasses
a wide range of techniques approach
Technologies aimed at enabling computers
to perform tasks that are typically
require human intelligence now for me I
can easily understand it but even if you
are facing the difficulty of
understanding what is trying to say and
I'm not able to get it you can give a
prompt something like
this
gbt give
me
example in a story format
and easy
words
illustrating what is AI so you can see
if you want to understand something like
this this is also very nice so here you
are going to get a story format so this
is also a prompt which you can use if
you are facing difficulty in
understanding the logic behind what this
concept is all about so these are two
type of learning way which I can advise
you to ask certain kind of prompts like
this so let me read the story First Once
Upon a Time in a small town called Tech
Philly so you can see it started
producing the words and you can see
techly which is kind of sounding very uh
ridiculous and but it's it's it's
certain thing that is trying to say
about uh what is basically AI in very
simple words so it is told okay there's
a village they love to create G gget and
machines to update their task so there
was a guy called Alex who buil a special
robot called Robo helper unlike the
other robots it was designed to think
and learn on its own now this is the key
thing about AI so you have to understand
something like this and as you read more
and more about this story you will feel
like what AI has done to solve their
problem guys there is one thing that I
want to say that any technology that
comes up there is the agenda behind that
and AI came up with the automation so in
order to simplify the daily day-to-day
task so basically in uh shorter words
you can say artificial intelligence is
certain thing which is has its own
ability to think and learn on its own
based on
experiences now if we outline our week 1
to two it said what is AI types of AI
applications of AI so you can search all
this prompts in GPT and you are going to
get a basic definition real life
examples based on this now week 3 to 4
is python now I will ask
GPT okay
for week 3
to4
given
examples of each Topic in coding
format with examples so suppose uh the
first thing says the basic syntax
so first let us give a general prompt
then we are going to analyze it now now
you can see jjb is not always correct
and since I have already learned python
so this is not a right prompt to give
okay this is a general mistake uh which
I did it to tell you that this is not
the way you have to follow instead of
this you can ask uh
JPY give me basic
syntax regarding
python so you you can see that the first
thing is comments how we are going to
put comments in Python next one is
indentation what what do you mean by
indentation suppose you don't understand
just ask GPT about these things
please so I have written this prompt and
you can
see it has started giving example so I
will explain what is indentation suppose
here it's given xal to 5 now there's a
conditional coming up if x is greater
than zero it says print X is positive
else print this negative now indentation
is generally meaning that everything
suppose in normal other programming
languages like Java what we do basically
we create brackets okay suppose we are
creating if and El statement or any
control flow or defining any function
how do we do it we close it and open it
that's a process and we use it
parenthesis but in Python we don't use
that so how does The Interpreter
understands that here you have defined a
function or there is a conditional so
what you do suppose here I have written
my conditional and inside this if this
statement is true I have indented it
means there's a imaginary bracket which
is closing and opening so instead of
this we just shift it so that it comes
in the respective blocks so the LI
indented it says like this now you can
see this line is also indented it's it's
a very simple meaning just uh you can
understand or imagine certain thing like
this that imaginary curly braces you are
putting it up but you're not putting any
parenthesis or this kind of thing as
compared to other programming language
this in the short from that means
indentation means it's a kind of a
formatting stuff which python follows so
in order to get more about it just keep
researching it keep typing your doubts
okay now you can see in similar way you
can learn python all over here by asking
GPT and the next thing is let's move on
to uh the week three one okay let let us
go over and you can see week three to
four you are going to learn about these
Basics so these are the prompts you have
to ask to the GPT again and again and
ask more relevant examples related to
this topic so you can see in the month
two what you have to do guys you have to
ask for python for data science you have
to ask regarding data structures
functions what are lists doues
dictionaries and with every prompt
suppose if I say this one
data structures and functions in Python
uh so I can ask include coding
questions
algorithms
optimizations so it sounds kind of a bit
oriented to technical so do include this
because in most of the interviews they
rely basically on coding questions what
are the algorithms you have studied and
how you can optimize it it's a very
basic concepts which is a kind of
foundational then you'll be moving
forward to other Technologies uh in this
course like machine learning or Advanced
machine learning deep learning and all
those things so let us see what uh
answer our GPT gives up suppose it says
all over here list stles and
dictionaries so first give a basic
prompt regarding this so these are the
data structures now include the second
prompt which I have given you which says
the coding questions algorithms and
optimizations based on this so it's
going to build a concept it's going to
rock solid your foundations for these
Concepts similarly follow these now next
comes the npay and pandas type the same
things use these libraries in certain
projects this is a one prompt additional
which I can advise you to also follow it
suppose
I have already given the prompt like
explain so you can understand uh like
key Concepts it has started giving so
this is the basic like uh followup which
you have to do with GPT kind of
interactional dialogue then moving ahead
so you can also see it has also given
example all over here okay now what you
have to do after this now you can ask
GPT
what id should we
use so it's going to say a lot of IDs uh
like py charm Visual Studio code Jupiter
notebook spider atom Sublime Text okay
but uh apart from this I would say you
can try
very popular ID that is Google collab
it's a cloud-based ID so here you can
just practice all these things okay you
can type this code which uh it says okay
and next you can perform your
iterations now let us move ahead and
similarly you have to explore all the
other libraries
present all over here okay now from uh
month two you have to understand all
these libraries for data science and
after uh the end which you have done it
you can ask GPT okay GPT give me some
certain sample questions uh based on
like python for data science and you can
just follow with that there's a fact
about GPT guys that GPT does not always
gives the right answer and for that
purpose I would like to say if GPT
misses out certain integrate things what
you have to do regarding the syllabus or
the road map for learning AI you can
also go to our simply learns official
website we have curated a proper road
map for learning AI including each
topics and also the entire syllabus so
go on the official website of Simply
learn.com
and you can see we have a cohort of
courses and you just click on all
courses and you can see there's a
category called Ai and machine learning
so just right click on this so there are
lot of programs written all over here so
suppose you want to take a postgraduate
program okay so right click on this one
and you could see that they would have a
syllabus all over here okay so you can
see there's a learning path written all
over here Essentials of generative a
prom engineering programming refresher
then python is there how you can apply
data science with python machine
learning deep learning so everything is
there just right click on the program
syllabus give your credentials and you
can easily have the syllabus now based
on the syllabus given by GPT and based
on this curated syllabus you can
maintain your road map for learning AI
now at the end I want you to also ask
gbt that uh at the last end you could
see we have projects okay so final
projects so you can ask GPT like uh or
the better thing I would advise you what
it would go you could go to the Kel's
website choose any data set which you
like suppose you wanted to solve a
problem based on the manufacturing
sector so you can how AI would apply in
manufacturing sector so just ask this
question or the first thing is let us
ask gbt what are the project ideas do we
have so hi
gbt can you give
me
[Music]
beginner
level
projects for learning
AI using cagles data set
so you could see there's a Titanic which
is a machine learning for disaster so
there's a project idea that predict the
survival on Titanic using the passengers
data so you're going to get this data
set okay
so if you just go on
kaggle Titanic data
set so you could see all over here
there's a link present the first link
you have to click on and it will take
you to the Titanic data set now you
could see the attributes the definitions
the key so basically it's a data
visualization problem you have to do a
little bit of Eda and these are the kind
of libraries which you have to use so
you could easily download this data set
and you have to predict okay so as you
can see all over here you have to do
data preprocessing feature engineering
classification algorithms you have to
use so you have to apply all these
things in this project so let let us ask
the first question that I need to
do what's
the so you can choose your project
suppose uh
say I want to do this project
give me
outline to do
this give me outline of
the
task I have
to
perform so you can see like uh the first
thing is data exploration you have to
load the Titanic data set so the ID
which you'll be using it I have already
told you it's a collab create a new
project all over here and then load the
data set so how to load the data set ask
GPT what are the commands for that how
to explore the data set how to
understand and study structure you can
check for missing values how to handle
them then you have to visualize the data
the next process you have to perform is
the feature engineering where you have
to create new features from existing
ones that may be useful for predictions
like titles combining family size
variables then then you have to encode
variables into numerical format using
techniques like one hot encoding or
label encoding moving ahead you have to
scale or normalize numerical features if
necessary having similar scales then you
have to build a model okay so these are
the respective task moving ahead you
have to also tune the model and optimize
it so these are the respective tasks for
that and finally submit your reports at
the kigle so this is the outcome of
entire learning and finally what you
have achieved in your report or an Anis
just document that ask GPT how to
properly document that report and in
this way your first project is going to
get completed so you can see it all over
here that it has given respectively
seven projects so after completing the
project it's going to give you a rock
solid foundation for learning AI now we
have completely utilized GPT for
learning Ai and you have got the
syllabus ask relevant questions
regarding coding problems
optimizations okay and
how we can implement it on Google collab
give some relevant examples and do seven
eight projects on the same concept in
this way you are going to build a rock
solid skill set so guys that was all for
