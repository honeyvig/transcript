science and data analytics program that
fits your experience and areas of
Interest now without further delay let's
get started with the main topic of
today's session which is data analytics
with AI so before proceeding with data
analytics with AI let's understand what
exactly is data analytics
so data analytics is not just um a step
where you just give your data to Ai and
it'll be done right so it's a stage byst
stage process let's understand all the
stages one after the other firstly you
might have different sources so uh
before we go ahead with the sources
let's understand the situation you might
be dealing with your client you might be
working with the company as a data
analyst so before you begin with data an
analysis you might have to have with
your client or the company you might
have to uh go through something called
as requirement Gathering right so
requirement Gathering will let you know
from where exactly you're getting the
data is it in the form of a PDF is it in
the form of uh an Excel spreadsheet or
is it going to be cloud or anything like
that right so you'll be understanding
what the source exactly is and follow
Follow by that you will understand what
is the request of your client what he is
looking for what he wants you to give
him right the insights of the data which
part of the business he wants you to
focus on and which part of the business
he wants to improve right and followed
by that you will come up with a time
span within that time span you need to
use that data build some insights and
give it to the client or your business
owner so that he comes up with the
business decision right so that's the
first requirement Gathering once you
have the source you come up with the
next step of the data analytics which is
cleaning the data and transforming the
data so it's really obvious for any
beginner or an expert who the data
analyst it is cleaning and
transformation what makes or what adds
value to your data once you clean your
data and transer form so what exactly
you mean by clean and transform so uh
let's say you might have some blank
entries or might be some wrong data type
or there might be some places where you
might have to split the data for example
if there is a customer and customer ID
mixed up together let's say customer ID
1 3 4 5 hyphen the name of the customer
right you wanted to split the customer
ID and split the customer name then
comes the data split option apart from
that if you want to categorize the data
into buckets let's say you might have a
column for customer age there might be
customers starting from 10 and and all
the way end up to 80 right in those
scenarios you might want to split the
data into buckets let's say 10 to 20 are
teenagers and above 20 to 30 are youth
and above um yeah 30 to under 50 are or
under 60 like let's say like 59 are
adults and after that maybe senior
citizens right then you have a smaller
window so that you can C capture which
category of the age group is bringing
you the most of the revenue right so
these are the parts of cleaning the data
and transforming the data and once
you're comfortable with it then you can
choose a platform where you want to
analyze your data which is which can be
tab which can be powerbi click view or
Excel or any of the tools that you might
want to prefer in our scenario we want
to go with AI right so AI can be
anything you can go with the Microsoft
co-pilot you can go with the open AI
chat GPD you can go with Google's gemini
or any of the AIS which can perform uh
data analytics there are some AI tools
out there which are dedicated for AI uh
data analytics right and once you're
done with it and the final stage is
analyzing the outcomes and reporting
that to your business owner or client so
I hope I made myself clear with these
stages of data analytics and Report now
let's look at an example to explain this
a little better so uh I have uh the data
set in Excel now this is our source the
first part of data analytics let's EXP
on the columns so there you go uh I said
something about data type so here you
can see we have some different data type
which we don't want which is in general
so we will change this data type to
short date to make a little more meaning
out of it and after that here we have
customer ID right so what we will do is
use data spit
here it text to columns D
limited
next so we have
other so here's the preview so you will
be receiving get in this form and if you
want to format the data as you like you
can go ahead so I leave it as general
for now and finalize the data type after
this plit is finished so what you can do
is add a column new column here so that
you can get an the uh column here to
split the data go to text to columns
once
again select and Del limited select next
and uh we have the input other next and
finish there you go you have customer ID
and you have customer name the
respective customer name here
it's so uh proceeding ahead we have U
quantity the quantity of product ordered
and we have traffics leads orders and
revenue right cost to company and
delivery status so in case if you wanted
to uh kind of calculate uh profit what
you can do is add a new column profit
and here you can do a mathematical
calculation equals to revenue
Minus cost company and you can extend
this particular column all the way to
the end so that you have the uh profit
numbers and here you can also change the
data type to currency and
uh go to home and here the data type
from
General to currency and there you go and
if you want it in rupees you can go with
rupees or if you want it in dollar you
can also have dollars right so that's
how you do it
I would like to go with dollars so more
and here go to currency and in currency
symbol I'll go with
the do then okay there you go you can
quickly save
it if you want to add some borders to
the data you can also do that
there you go so far so good so we are
now connected now comes the next step
which is loading the data and analyzing
it right so currently we choose the
platform as Excel so you can do this on
Excel PP and chat GPT as well so let's
go with the first uh one which just
excel's AI so here you can see analyze
data or also people call it uh the
co-pilot of excel right now you can just
click all the data and click on analyze
basically what you can do is insert and
go to the priv table option and here you
can insert a pivot table and after that
you can find out the requirements what
you want the sales from the central
region South Region and uh which
category of the products have been sold
the highest and what the highest
Crossing product what are the number of
leads and you can estimate the
performance of traffic on a month on
month basis right you can do that all
but if you want to reduce the time
basically I would like to tell you go to
that particular part first understand
manual process and after that go to the
analyze data option which is the
automated or AI generated report right
it will now read your data and it will
give you some insights from the data
given right here you can see the cost to
Company by order status and here you can
see you can insert a priv table for that
and here you can see you can insert some
graphs and charts here part graph and
here you have another one now you can
see that it has all 24 results all the
insights now if I can ask give me a pie
chart pie chart of
sales and
category here you go here you have a so
basically what copilot did is it created
a pivot table of sales and category and
out of that PIV table it extracted the
pie chart and generated one for you in
this way you can create uh multiple
options let's say I want to create a
line
draft month on month
month enter now here it again created a
pivot table and here it generated a line
graph on month bis and how many number
of uh traffic or how many number of
visitors your website have and in this
way you can create a long list of all
the required charts and graphs for your
uh website and or the client and uh
created dashboard of it which is
completely interact now this was the
excel's AI now if we go to another one
which is powerbi so here you can see a
completely uh prepared dashboard in
powerbi and we can create this once
again or you can at least understand how
it was done right now let's get the
data from Excel
workbook so my workbook or my d
is somewhere here sales data I would
like to go with orders data only one
file is enough for 2024 and your data
will be shortly
loaded select spreadsheet one and load
the data since we already transformed it
there is no need for transforming it
once again so the data is been loaded
successfully it's going to take some
time 2,000 rows
loaded sheet once so we are going to
work with shet one now you can select
the visualization you want like I want
to create a line graph here repot like I
want to create a line graph here select
and for this particular line gra you
will have Fields x-axis and y axis now
what I'll do is I'll drag and drop x a
sorry date to x-axis field and uh
traffic to y access
field now here in x-axis I would
eliminate here I would eliminate quarter
I would eliminate date I just want month
on month right here you have a clear
month- on Monon traffic line gra right
now let's quickly delete it we don't
want this
now and remove it now what if I tell you
there is an option where you can just
double click and or right click and you
will get a option
here you can query right you can just
write down query L
gra type of graph you require
traffic write spellings
correctly month
on and enter you will get the graph you
are looking
for there you go
right so apart from this uh let's put
the month on Monon cph here apart from
this let's double click once again and
uh category wise
sales category
sale by
chart there you go and uh
now region was double click once again
region wise
sales bar
graph select the first one and there you
go I think there is a small mistake in
the selection spelling select the first
one once again and we will have a Barra
in region wi spaces
or we can also go with the similarly we
can also go with the map
chart for
States and
revenue select the first
option and you will have all the
American states and their revenue
details
here right so in such way you can use
the artificial intelligence of power pi
and create a completely interactive gra
just like this one so if I select the
standard shipment mode what are the
sales reports and if I select the entire
shipment modes what are the reports and
if I select the home category what are
the sales reports and which part of the
nation and which uh and what are the
sales and order for month traffic and
everything details here right and one go
is completely interactive now let's move
on to the next part of uh our session
for today so we will be using U chat GPD
for our data analytics so here you go
now let's load the data before that
let's write a
PR
some on sales
sales
reporter visualization and now load the
data upload from
computer and we have the sales data here
the ERS data select the aers data file
and
open the data will be loaded shortly
and since it's loaded can just push the
command
front it'll first review the contents
and understand what exactly is present
in your content and the data type along
with the data type right it has 2,000
entries 17 columns here's the brief
overview of all the
columns so it's asking you would you
like uh an overall summary or a specific
aspect so let's go with the specific
speciic aspect instead of overall
summary I want
the region wise
sales as a bar
graph okay we didn't have a column as
bar sales uh it's in turn taking Revenue
yes there you go sales revenue by region
as a Barra Now by
chart for category
Revenue okay so there is some uh limit
for analysis okay that's not a problem
we can uh change the account and try to
do it once again or I should have chosen
the overall summary right but if you go
to the chat gbt plus uh Edition you can
get that let's try the plus Edition once
so we are in the plus Edition now
so it generated some visualizations
which is completely downloadable here
you can go with that as well so the
prompt is still running let's wait for a
couple of more minutes and see what
exactly Char is up
to so here we have a profit by category
which was our second uh request which
did not get
uh successfully authorized because we
didn't have plus one so now we can see
Revenue versus cost to company in top 10
products so which are the top 10
products which are giving the maximum
revenue and here is a detailed report
and if you would like to continue with a
few more reports like we did before in
pobi and Exel like
traffic versus uh month on
month is a land
graph let's try
that the there you go so we have a land
graph of traffic on a month-on-month
basis so that's how you can conduct some
data analytics using different AIS on
different platforms so there are many
number of platforms TBL powerbi click
view Excel SQL chat gbd Gemini and a few
more dedicated artificial intelligence
tools which are for AI data analytics
and that brings us to the next part of
data analytics with the AI so how does
data analytics and AI work so first
basically once you load the data AI will
start preparing and processing your data
right so the Transformations what you do
are also can be possible in AI as well
if you request AI to do the
Transformations it can do itself but I
would recommend you perform the
Transformations because you know what
are the exact requirements are once your
data is completely trans transform you
can load it and get the
reports the next part of it is pattern
recognition as you have already seen
Char GPT recognizes each and every
aspect of your data from the data type
to the Manu details like currency and
everything it understands the data first
and then it will request you it will ask
you if you want a complete summary or if
you are looking for a particular aspect
right machine learning algorithms can
identify patterns Trends and
relationships that may not be apparent
to human analysts and there is a
possibility that chat GP can even
identify a few more insights that you
never expected to have right and uh
moving on to the next part Predictive
Analytics AI can also perform some
Predictive Analytics and give you the
forecast of what exactly is going to
happen in the upcoming future in your
business that may or may not happen if
you find something is about to go down
you can prevent it by taking some
predictive steps or measurable steps
which can avoid that loss right and
automated insights and rep you can also
request Char GPD right in Excel there is
something called as power query it acts
like a macro or XL VBA where it stores
each and every transformation step you
apply in the similar way each and every
transformation or step that you apply to
modify or try to add value to your data
and teach that to your AI so that it can
also understand that particular
automated the transformation steps and
report to you on a month-on-month basis
right so this will stop your
month-on-month activity of cleaning your
data transforming your data loading your
data analyzing extracting some insights
and then creating a strategy so all the
steps will be eliminated because chat
gbd or any other eii will take care of
it and you can focus on implementing
some business strategies and we have
decision making so AI can also help you
with some critical business strategies
and also help you in decision making AI
algorithms can optimize complex
processes and decision making by
evaluating multiple variables and
multiple scenarios now last but not
least continuous
learning so AI is capable to adapt and
learn new things in your business like
how it processes how it functions and
what's the data source and most of the
aspects in which are involved in
business and data analytics AI systems
have the ability to continuously learn
and adapt based on the new data and
feedback and that brings us to the end
