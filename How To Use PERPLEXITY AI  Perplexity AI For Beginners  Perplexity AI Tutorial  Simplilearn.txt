let's get started so perplexity AI is
basically a super smart search engine it
uses Advanced AI to not only find
information for you but also understand
the context and give detailed reliable
answers it's like having a personal
research assistant write on your screen
so first things first first let's get
signed up if you don't have an account
yet click on sign up and enter your
details it's really quick once you
signed up just log in with new
credentials so now let's explore what
perplexity AI can do so this is the main
interface it's super clean and simple
and right here is the search bar so
let's ask a question like what is
artificial intelligence what is see as
you can see there appears suggestions
for your similar searches right just
like how it appears on Google so let's
just type it and
enter yeah as you can see perplexity a
quickly pulls up a detailed answer with
in-depth information so plus it lists
all the sources it used for the same so
these are the sources you can find them
so you know exactly where the
information is coming from and check if
the sources can be trusted so this is
perfect for getting a quick overview and
then dive in deeper if you need more
details so like if you just click the
sources you can just check if the
sources are reliable or not okay another
awesome feature is the follow-up
suggestions which you can find at the
bottom of the page so these are related
questions that help you explore the
topic further now another option is you
also have an option to create images and
videos for the same so if you uh you
know check the right side of the page
you can actually find related images for
the topic so if you need it for your
work you can actually take from this and
also you can search videos also so they
will give you related videos from
YouTube and some other sources now there
is also an option to generate an image
but then this is only available for pro
users so you can actually you know give
a description and generate the image but
this is not available for free users now
another interesting feature is the
search Focus Now search focus is great
as in you can narrow down the sources
that you would like to take references
from like for example there are options
like whether you want to you know search
all over the Internet or you want to
refer only academic papers Etc so this
immensely helps in eliminating
unreliable sources now next we have a
pro search option here so in Pro search
and perplexity I makes searching better
by offering Advanced features like it
gives better answers and more customized
options so it gives you access to more
high quality sources like ensuring the
information you get is accurate and up
toate so with Pro search you can explore
complex questions in more details like
coding questions Etc and you can get
more insights and make your research
process faster and reliable so it's a
great tool for professional researchers
and anyone who needs greater details so
you just have to keep in mind that the
pro search can only be used for five
times in a span of 4 hours for free
users but for unlimited Pro Searchers
you can purchase the updated version of
the per perplexity AI now let's see what
collections are so let's see you are
doing a research project so as you
explore and find detailed answers on
different aspects so you can save each
of these answers as a collection like
you know you'll be giving different
questions you'll be asking different
questions of the same topic so you can
save all those uh answers as a single
collection so to create a collection
you'll see an option to add there is a
plus sign so an option to add to an
existing collection or create a new one
so here I'm creating a new collection
called
AI creating a new collection called AI
so I'll give I have given the title as a
you can also add an emoji if needed also
you can give a prompt if you want your
answers in a specific template so here
you have a prompt options so for example
if you want the write up in points with
each pointing sting an example you can
give that prompt like
write
answers in points
citing relevant examples 28 so now this
particular answer or this particular
article is under the AI collection so
now whenever you find more answers
related to AI just you can add them to
this collection so it keeps everything
organized in one place making it easy to
review all your information now next
we'll just check out the Discover
section so here you have the Discover
section so this is basically where you
can find trending topics and popular
questions that other users are exploring
so it's a great way to see updated on
what's happening in various fields and
you can take ideas from these also now
let's check out what library is so the
library is your personal storage for all
the answers and reports you have seen so
it's neatly organized so you can easily
find what you're looking for so whether
it's for the school project work or
personal interest having a library of
Saved information is incredibly useful
now another exciting feature is you can
actually summarize charts graphs and
PDFs so let's see how so let's form a
new thread so here there's actually an
upload option where you can attach
images but this is actually only
possible for paid users okay so here you
have an option to attach or upload the
images but you can upload the images
only if you have an upgrad version so if
you're having the free version what you
can do is you can copy the image address
and paste it okay like for example let's
just search
uh Global crime rate graph let's take
this graph we can copy image address
just check if the image address is
right yeah copy the image address paste
it over here and after that you can
formulate a precise question about the
graphs data or trends that you want to
summarize like for example you can give
what are the main trends shown in the
graph or can you summarize the key
insights from this data we'll just ask
them to can you summarize the key
insights from this data and hit enter so
perplexity a will analyze a graph and
generates a summary Based on data Trends
and patterns it identifies so if needed
you they will also ask question like you
know exactly what you're looking for so
we can give like you know crime dates by
country they have actually G given the
suggestions also so we'll give the same
like country with the highest crime rate
country with
the crime rate now it will analyze the
graph and give us the answer see
Venezuela has the highest crime rate
Venezuela has the highest crime rate so
this is how it can analyze the graphs
charts and also you can upload it in PDF
format also okay so now you can save the
summarized insights for future reference
and also you can share with colleagues
now here we have a share option so you
can actually shared with colleagues and
other stakeholders if needed so these
