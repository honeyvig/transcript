be learning about how to merge cells in
excel but before we begin let me tell
you guys that we have daily updates on

tech gig in a continuous hunt for latest
technological trends then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit that
bell icon to never miss an update from
simply learn now without further ado
let's get started with how to merge
cells in excel
so let's get started and let's begin
with our practical mode so we are in
practical mode and we have started our
microsoft excel and you can see on my
screen we have the sales data of one
single employee in the month of january
okay so this is the sales data of john
in january sales
now let us imagine that
we have the same person's or same john's
data of sales of all the three months
okay so here we have the sales data of
john for january february and march
and you wanted to club all these three
months and write it down as quarter one
right
so let us try doing it
now you can see that
only january is replaced as quarter one
and february and march are still
remaining the same
so let us try to delete them
so we have deleted them and i think now
it looks like uh this is the sales data
of one single quarter that is quarter
one but again
quota one is under column b and anyone
who looks at it feels like this data is
of january february and march and all
the quarter one details are only present
in b column but c and d are completely
you know different from this one right
so you don't want that kind of an
impression on your uh you know the one
who are presenting to you so in those
situations you want to merge all these
three columns and make sure that the
quarter one is present somewhere in
between the cells so that all the data
looks relevant and it defines that these
data elements belong to photo one right
so there is an option in excel to do
that so select all the cells that you
want to merge and go into home button
and in home button get into the
alignment group and select merge and
center so you can do it directly also
you have a couple of more options there
is merge and center merge across merge
cells and unmerge so we'll go through it
one by one so first we'll go through
merge and center
so there you go the cell's got merged
and it has been aligned into center
now again if your manager or anyone
superior to you
wants this to be you know independent
like they want it to be in terms of
january february and march so that they
can have access to it and month wise so
you want to unmerge it back right how to
do that now so the same menu and select
unmerge and there you go you have your
data back in the original form again all
you have to do is you know rename a few
cells
there you go
and you have it back right so in a few
situations okay you can also add the
borders so that it looks more relevant
now um
you know let's try to merge this again
and watch and center yeah
now again uh
let us imagine that you are going
through an appraisal cycle
and you also wanted to add some comments
about the sales happening in your
company uh regarding uh all the
employees right so also we have that
here now let me expand a little bit
yeah okay
so again let's merge and center
now
uh you wanted to you know uh you wanted
to take a review of your level one level
two and level three managers
so you have all the three uh
rows here but you can see the cells are
not merged
and you wanted to merge every single row
so merging and centering everything row
wise would be a little time consuming i
mean three columns is okay but what if
you had like uh you had to take a review
from
a couple of more managers like five to
ten right
or imagine that
you wanted to write some random comments
apart from review you wanted to write
some random comments based on month-wise
uh sales or something like that so it
would be time consuming right so apart
from that you have another option where
you you know select all the cells and
come over here and select the option of
merge across
and all the cells will be merged all
together at once and you will be having
those individual rows where you can
write down your reviews like review one
and so on review
two right so this is how the option of
merge across works and we already have
them through the margin center and merge
is completely similar to margin center
so this is how margin center merge sells
and
merge across and unmerged cells and
excel works so with this we have come to
an end of this tutorial on how to merge
cells in excel if you have any queries
regarding any of the topics covered in
this session or if you require the

session then please feel free to let us
