politely repeat your answer if you are
asked too where do you see yourself in
five years ever heard of this interview
question I'm sure you must have this is
one of the most frequently asked
questions so what does the interviewer
keep in mind while asking you this what
is your safe answer the answer to this
can get quite delicate and can set you
apart from the other candidates here we
are to help you answer this question
smoothly so today we bring you the
interesting video on how to answer where
do you see yourself in five years
before answering this question you need
to understand what the interviewer wants
to know while asking you such a question
when you are asked where you see
yourself in five years it is nothing but
a question about your career goals
employers want to learn about your goals
and see if it fits with the job they're
offering interviewers wish to know if
this job role will satisfy you and that
you'll work hard and stay with the
company for a long time they want to
assess you on your vision Ambitions and
career Outlook they wish to see if you
have realistic expectations of your
career and if this particular position
aligns with your goals overall you must
think about how this job aligns with
your broader professional goals most
jobs need training no employer would be
interested in investing their time and
money in a candidate who is planning to
leave hence companies hire good
prospects for their businesses those who
are genuinely enthusiastic about the job
and those who are truly Dependable you
should give an honest answer to this
question but make sure to present your
answer her well in a way that can help
you get hired you must make sure to
think about your goals before
formulating an answer to the interview
think of this question as an opportunity
for you to do a bit of career planning
and answer the question by developing
your answer to this question you can get
an insight into your career Direction
however a wrong answer to this question
can wreck an opportunity for you so how
to answer this question rightly here are
a few magic tips to help you first and
foremost do not answer this question
with an I don't know and avoid joking
this shows you that you have no
seriousness towards this job in your
career employers want to see if this job
truly matters to you or not it shouldn't
look like this job is just a way to pass
your time or an opportunity to break
your unemployment secondly when
answering it is best if you stay
grounded and not bring up unrealistic
expectations for example do not say
things like you see yourself as a CEO or
a CMO in the next five years that will
give the employer a feeling that you are
over ambitious and that you may not be
happy if the growth doesn't escalate to
that speed very few employers will be
interested in hiring you then such an
answer will also make your current job
just a stepping stone and not something
you truly want hence refrain from
speaking about promotions or seeing your
job roles and rather stay grounded
finally what are you supposed to say
then how are you supposed to answer the
question one quick tip is that you must
present your answers as actions and not
goals when answering this question it is
advice that you break this question into
Parts one as a short-term goal and
another as a long-term goal this will
help you channelize your answer and
provide good Clarity to the interviewer
for example you can say something on
these grounds for the next couple years
I would like to immerse myself in this
job and improve my skills around it
after which I would like to take up
additional responsibilities and help
others in the organization with my
expertise
when you say this it shows how solely
focused you are on this role how excited
you are to learn new skills and at the
same time it also shows that your
learning will help the company in the
future make sure to mention a set of
actions you will undertake to help
facilitate your growth and not the final
goal by itself the bottom line an
employer wants to see your future goals
and see if it will align with the
company's needs by doing so they will
understand if you are an asset to the
company or not preparing for this
question is a great exercise in
understanding what you like doing and
what is genuinely meaningful to you in
the future
take the time to think about what you
want in life and present your answer
well this way there are more chances for
you to be hired and you will also be
happy about where you will be in the
next five years you might have often
been asked to speak about your strengths
and weaknesses in an interview typically
this question can get you anxious which
happens because you're unsure how to put
across your strengths and weaknesses in
an honest yet qualifying way here we are
to prep you up with the answer to this
question imagine when your interview is
going all well and suddenly the
interviewer asks you what your strengths
and weaknesses are why do you think such
a question is asked in the first place
well it is asked to see how good you
evaluate yourself and how self-aware you
are through your answer the interviewer
also tries to understand how fit you are
for the job based on its nature hence it
is of utmost importance that you prepare
your answer well and not let it damage
your chances of being hired all of us
have strengths and weaknesses however
what matters here is if you acknowledge
them and how cleverly you presented
before the interviewer let's begin with
the first part of the question and that
is what your strengths are so do you
think you need to praise yourself while
answering this absolutely not refrain
from using multiple adjectives to
Showcase how good you are as this can
make you look overconfident instead use
a couple of attributes that you think
you have and at the same time those that
are going to be highly beneficial for
the job that you are applying for the
best way you can do this is by
understanding the job description well
and mapping your qualities to those that
can be a boon to the job for example if
you apply for a job that requires you to
work with data and provide business
results one of your biggest strengths
could be problem solving and critical
thinking
other examples of strengths that work
well for almost every job are an eye for
detail team player time management
flexibility quick learner Etc the next
key point to keep in mind is to pinpoint
your strengths with evidence just
listing these adjectives won't suffice
you need to speak of one or two
situations at work or during your
college times wherein you have been
successful because of your strength for
instance you can say how your time
management skill helped you complete a
project way before the deadline this way
you're supporting your strength with a
true story as well by doing this you
sound honest and more believable to the
interviewer you are free to add other
strengths that you feel suit you however
keep the list short and quantify it down
on that note I have a small question for
you all apart from the previously
mentioned strings do you have any other
interesting strengths that can impress
the recruiter if yes please pause and
tell us what the skill is you can drop
your answers in the comment section
below now let's get to the trickier part
and that is how to answer what are your
weaknesses before answering this
question carry out a self-reflection
identify your weakness and try to
improve our first tip to you here is not
to say that you don't have any
weaknesses because the interviewer will
understand in a jiffy that you are lying
all of us have some weaknesses and it's
okay to acknowledge them next don't try
to answer this question with an obvious
strength for example do not say you're
too hard working or that you are an
idealist this sounds unbelievable and
too cliche you shouldn't answer this
question with any of your personal
weaknesses and remember to be
professional so how do you answer then
think of a real weakness that you have
experienced in the past and construct a
story around it the next step is to
mention how you are working on your
weaknesses and mention the steps you
have taken to overcome them weaknesses
are not personality traits hence one can
always take the initiative to overcome
them what matters is for us to be
cognizant of our weaknesses interviewers
should feel like your weaknesses are no
longer that bad and you must keep them
in the past when listing your weaknesses
you need to be clever and read the job
description first sometimes the
weaknesses you say might not gel well
with the job you're applying for it
would be best if you don't seem like a
misfit for the job because of your
weakness hence it is safe if you speak
of a legitimate weakness simultaneously
a one that doesn't affect your hiring a
few weaknesses you can say depending on
the job profile are public speaking
attention to detail as you tend to spend
more time learning to multitask being
straightforward Etc
once again make sure to choose a
weakness that doesn't largely affect the
job you're applying for during an
interview even if you don't answer two
or more technical questions there is a
chance that you may still get selected
however not answering the non-technical
questions correctly can really get you
on the back foot tricky interview
questions are the mind-boggling
questions that hinder the candidate's
confidence during the interview session
these questions aren't technical or
theoretical neither are there to check
your knowledge but these questions are
to check the candidate's confidence and
spontaneity these tricky questions are
generally asked in the HR rounds of the
interview or the non-technical round the
questions are pretty straightforward
here but the candidate gets confused in
answering the same
let us now see the most commonly asked
tricky questions and the ways to tackle
them the first question that is asked
very often is what are your weaknesses
answering this question is a whole
different skill many candidates may
share their actual or hypothetical
weaknesses which is not wrong however it
will be safer if you share a weakness
that doesn't hinder your chance of
getting a job hence mention a flaw that
will look like a strength to the
questioner it works better for example
tending to take on too much
responsibility the second question which
is commonly asked is why should we hire
you answering this question is a piece
of art here you have to prove your worth
in the eyes of the interviewer it would
be best if you went through the keywords
present in the job description and
Target that particular skill and give an
example of your previous experience
regarding the same
for example suppose the job description
has the keywords like data mining or
dbms you could answer like this I read
the job description and it mentions data
mining so let me recall my graduation
days where I've worked on a project that
was the direct implementation of data
mining and dbms the next question is
recall a moment when you have overcome a
hurdle here you have to share some
heroic achievements that you may have
come across the star method is a very
famous method to crack these types of
questions
star is an abbreviation of situations
tasks action and result so provide a
summary of the situation your role in
action to resolve the issue and how the
problem was determined as a result for
example after working on a client's
first draft for over a year I was tasked
with revamping their entire campaign
strategy after hours of brainstorming
and analyzing previous client
presentations I was able to come up with
a new plan
another common question that is asked is
why do you want to work here the
question is raised to see whether you
researched the company the job or the
designation that you are applying for
through your answer you need to Showcase
your skills to empower your team and the
whole company for example working year
has always been my dream I have worked
on the skills that are required in this
job in my previous jobs too before
proceeding with the next tip imagine
your interviewer asks you this tricky
question why do you want to leave your
current company how would you answer
this question let us know in the comment
section below the best answer can stand
a chance to win an Amazon gift voucher
the next frequently Asked question is
where do you see yourself after three
years to answer this question you need
to clearly State your goals and how you
plan on growing in ways that will fit
into the job that you are applying for
if you are not confident about the
future avoid saying it during an
interview instead focus on the role that
fits well with your current
accomplishments
the next question is quite challenging
what salary do you think you deserve
there is a very famous saying the person
who says the salary is the loser it
would be best if you'd never give out a
perfect figure for your salary
expectation if the number is lower than
the employer's plan ask for a range
instead to not give a perfect number
instead provide a range not more than
the difference of 50 000 rupees or four
hundred thousand dollars whatever
currency you are dealing in next up we
have a question that is not the commonly
asked but an important one do you have
any regrets regrets refer to the
shortcomings that you may have come
across in your work life to answer that
share your mistake and share that you
learned from it and how you overcame it
for example I do constantly wish I had
known what I wanted to do in the
beginning of my career having more years
to develop in progress would have helped
me be all the better at my job however I
acquired skills in my previous job that
I wouldn't have otherwise learned that
helped me in my work today in the end we
would like to conclude that be well
prepared for the interview and follow
tips that we have provided and you can
crack such tricky questions that come
your way why should we hire you the most
inevitable question asked during an
interview
it is considered as a brain twister
question as you have to provide an
answer that can simply State your Worth
to the company the interviewer is
already familiar with your key skills
and qualifications and with this
question he wants to check the way in
which you can distinguish yourself from
the other candidates the question why
should we hire you is basically to see
whether you can justify your
achievements and educational
qualifications
obviously you cannot save because I need
a job instead your answer should
showcase that you are the best of the
lot and have a better approach to all of
the employers queries
as we know the purpose of the questions
asked during the HR interview we must
keep track of our accomplishments
technical knowledge alone won't suffice
soft skills and personality are also
judged along with the way that you speak
the fluency and the confidence in
delivering your answer
in this video we have provided several
instructions and points where we can see
why the interviewer is asking this
question and how you can overcome this
situation
to begin with to not be self-centered
focus on the employer's needs to do so
you must research the company job
description social websites and recent
Affairs of the company
tip number two is to elaborate on your
skills and make the recruiters believe
that with your experience and skill you
can add value to the company and Achieve
even greater Heights share instances of
your life where you have used those
skills for example you can say something
like at my previous job we were given a
project where Azure was to be used along
with Swift and in my tea I had the
knowledge about Azure and my colleague
had command overswift so we tackle the
project together and surpassed it our
third tip is to Target a keyword in the
job description this is always fruitful
thoroughly read the job description and
responsibilities
Target a few of the skills mentioned in
the description and explain your
application of the same skill in your
past projects or any other
implementations for example icweca plays
a crucial role here and I know it well
as I have worked on it in my final year
college project meanwhile here's a
question for you what do you think are
the attributes that the interviewer is
trying to extract from you through this
question
drop your answers in the comment section
below and the best answers stands a

fourth tip while answering the why
should we hire you question is not to
State any repeated one or two Word
answers like I'm very punctual about my
work or I'm very laborious
State something original that gives you
an upper hand over the other candidates
Define yourself for the job exclaim your
soft skills with a bunch of examples
like there was an instance when my team
leader wasn't available for an important
meeting so I stood up and directed my
team and so on
confidence brings Courage the answer
that you are giving should have a rich
vocabulary along with a lot of
confidence showcase your strength look
at your achievements and highlight them
in the employer's eyes you can also
State bold answers like if you want
someone who can work without any
supervision I'm the one you can hire the
only formula that we can use to answer
the question is to first start with
thank you for asking me this question
after this you can either Target the
skills or showcase your skills as well
as experience in the same field the key
factor for answering is to be confident
throughout you can also State your
