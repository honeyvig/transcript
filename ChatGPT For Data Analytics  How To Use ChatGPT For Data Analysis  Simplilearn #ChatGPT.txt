in city of metropolis nestled within the
walls of metropolis University there was
a freshman named Max Max was passionate
about data analytics but found himself
overwhelmed by the complexities of his
first major project the project was
crucial a stepping stone in his journey
to becoming a data analyst but the SE of
numbers and statistics seem more like a
puzzle than a clear one evening Max sat
in the University Library his laptop
open to a spreadsheet filled with data
his eyes reflecting confusion and
frustration the clock digged away going
in the silent room just when Max was
about to close his laptop and despair a
soft mechanical voice fell the air hello
Max it seems you could use some
assistance with your data analysis
startled Max looked around and noticed a
Sleek humanoid robot approaching his
table its metallic frame glimmered under
the library's lights and its eyes glowed
with a gentle blue hue the name tag read
a which stood for artificial
intelligence data assistant Max though
initially taken a back found comfort in
A's calm and friendly demoner yes I'm
really struggling with this Max admitted
I have all this data but I don't know
where to start a smiled and told let's
start with the Basics shall we data
analysis is like solving a mystery you
have clues in the form of your data and
you need to find the story they tell
patience and Clarity Ada guided Max
through the process they began with
exploratory data analysis where data Tau
Max to summarize and visualize data
revealing patterns and anomalies Max's
eyes lit up as he saw the data come to
life in colorful graphs and charts then
they dived into statistical analysis ad
I explained Concepts which were complex
in simple terms making it easy for Max
to grasp the principles of correlation
and regression together they interpreted
Data uncovering Insights that were
hidden beneath the surface hour was
passed and Max with ads guidance
transformed his raw data into a
compelling analytical report the once
daunting task now F like an exciting
Adventure Max had not only completed his
project but also had G gained a deeper
understanding of data analytics as the
first light of dawn crept into the
library Max looked at AA with gratitude
and said thank you Adam I couldn't have
done this without you you didn't just
help me with my project youve open my
eyes to the beauty of dat A's eyes
glowed warmer and she said that's what
I'm here for Max to help students like
you find the stories hidden in numbers
remember data is not just numbers it's a
narrative waiting to be told Max nodded
his heart full of new found confidence
and enthusiasm as AA quietly ped down
Max packed his things ready to present
his project knowing that this was just
the beginning of his journey in the
world of data analytics and so in the
heart of metropolis University a parting
data analyst took his first successful
step with a bit of help from his eii

get started so for today we will
consider one of the data set from kagle
and try to download that and try to
build a story about it right and let us
assume that we are in the beginning
steps of data analytics just like Max
that we discussed before and we need the
help from chat GPD so let's quickly go
to the website of kagle and check out
some data sets so now we are on the
kaggle website and if you go to the data
sets we have the categories trending
data sets movies and TV shows Etc now
let's go into the trending data sets and
we have one here which says about glass
door data science chops 2024 which seems
to be one of the latest data sets that
has been uploaded onto kaggle now I
think this should be a good start and
here if you scroll down you have some
information about the data set so we
have uh company job title company rating
job description location salar average
estimate salary uh pay period company
sici company founded Etc right we have a
pretty much good data set that we have
over here here and we can continue with
that right now we can just download this
data set and try to upload this onto
chat GPD and ask chat GPD for some
exploratory data analysis remember we
are in the stepping stone to become a
data analyst and we only know the
fundamentals and the complete project
will be taken care by chat gbd right
over here now if you open chat gbd and
if you you try to create a new uh prompt
let's say we are going to create a new
prompt and now we are using chat gbd4
here and you can also enable plugins if
you want right if you have one I have
one for data analytics but anyways we'll
just go with the default chat gbd4 and
if you go into your user space and here
you can find custom instructions but
before we get started with custom
instructions let me explain what exactly
it is let's say chat gbd doesn't know
about you or your profession but you
explain chat gbd that you are a
professional data analyst and you
explain your terms and conditions and
you explain the way you want your answer
right then the chat gbd will understand
what you are and what type of answers
you are expecting from it and then it
will give you a tailored made answer for
you right now let's try to fill out the
custom instructions for your chat gbd
and now I have already listed some of
the custom instructions for my chat gbd
so what would you like chat gbd to know
about you to provide better responses
and how would you like chat gbt to
respond now let's copy this prompt here
and go back to chat GPD and customize
your
instructions and now let's again go back
to to the text window and here let's
copy the response that you expect chat
GB to give you and again paste that in
this particular space and now save it
there you go now you have your
customized uh instruction to chat jpd
and you have clearly explained it what
are you exactly looking for now we have
downloaded that particular data set from
kagle there you go and now let's go to
our downloads and try to extract that
particular data that we just
downloaded there you go glass door job
postings now let's try to upload this to
chat
GP let's try to create a new chat so now
we have a new chat window now let's try
to attach the DAT that we just
downloaded so let's navigate back to
downloads and here you should be having
the file somewhere yeah so this is this
is the file that we just got extracted
and here we have the glass door CH
postings open there you go now you have
the data set uploaded it looks like
you've uploaded a file named class to
job posting CSV how can I assist you
with this file are you looking for a
specific type of analysis or data
processing now that your chat GPD is
ready you can just tell your chat GPD
that you need an explorat data analysis
of this particular data set I
GPT I need your
help
perform a
complete Eda
or last through job posting. CSV
help me by
providing some
interesting
charts and
graphs along with your
report or detailed
report now chart GPD will start
analyzing your data and it will give you
the report that you're looking
for it it will explain you some of these
several key aspects regarding your data
set and what type of operations it can
generate or what type of operations it
can carry out and what results can it
give you it will give you a brief
overview of that and then it will begin
with the
report so according to the report we can
see data analyst has the highest number
of job openings followed by that we have
data scientist and data Engineers so if
you are looking to build a carrier out
of data analysis data science and data
engineering then it's the right time you
have some company rating distributions
location analysis and further more so
Bengaluru has the highest number of job
openings followed by that we have remote
operations and next Hyderabad and pun
are the next highest job locations and
we have salary estimations that should
take some time there you go we have the
salary estimations in terms of
rupees company size and sector analysis
the next
one and there you go company size
distribution is the next
one and finally we have ratings
analysis so this is about work life
balance being offered by various
companies so the company with the best
ratings will be the right company for
you to join as a data analyst or a data
engineer or data
scientist there you go so I think there
is some limitation for the number of
words you type in one prompt so you can
continue with another prompt and you
will be getting the data you are looking
for so that's how you can briefly
understand how you can utilize chat GPD
for data analytics or to be detailed
exploratory data analytics for your
day-to-day life and with that we have
come to an end of this session on chat
GPT for data analytics and should you
