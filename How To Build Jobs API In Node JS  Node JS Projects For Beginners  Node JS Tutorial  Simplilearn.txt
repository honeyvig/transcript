hello everyone and welcome to today's
video on building task manager app using
HTML CSS and JavaScript in this web
application what we are going to do we
will be able to add a task using you
know any task which you want to do
suppose say you have to study around at
10: p.m. so you can add that task and a
new dashboard will be created for you
where you can see on what time you have
created your task you can delete the
task and you can click on the completed
button if you have completed that
required task if you want to learn how
to create a simple and elegant
application like this watch this video
till the end but before that I request
you guys that do not forget to hit the
Subscribe button and click the Bell
icon just a quick info guys simply learn
has got a post-graduate program in full
stack web development in collaboration
with the Caltech University in this
course you're going to learn the modern
coding techniques with the boot cam
level intensity and gain all you need to
be a full stack Technologies so guys you
can check out the link in the
description box so guys let us see how
our application looks like so you can
see all over here that we have a task
manager app where we can add a task okay
suppose say I have a
music
classes at 900 p.m. and if I want to add
this task you can see it shows on the
dashboard that I have a music class at
9:00 p.m. now I have two actions to
perform the first one is a complete
button and the second one is a delete
button suppose for God's sake I have
completed this task I can click on the
complete button and you can see all over
here that a line has been created all
over here and it shows that this task
has been completed we can also remove
this task from our dashboard by clicking
on the delete button you can add n
number of tasks suppose say
music
study okay
[Music]
gaming and say
coding okay now this is a very elegant
application a very simple one but
instead you'll get to learn how to apply
the JavaScript functionality how you
going to create the UI using HTML and
how most importantly you're going to
style this web application so we will be
using vs code as our IDE and from there
we can see how the manipulations what we
are doing is affecting on the user
interface let us go into our code part
so guys as you can see all over here we
have two folders the first one is a
starter folder and third one is a
complete file so in the starter folder
we have index.html script.js and
style.css so in the index.html guys what
we are going to do so let us see our
code first okay so in the starter if I
just click on we could see that there is
a head written all over here we have
given a link to our style.css which is
completely empty right now except we
have defined root all the way here now
moving ahead we are going to populate
this file so that our UI looks like that
now let us go to our index.html and let
us write our HTML code so guys as you
can see all over here first we have to
create the body and inside the body I
have to create a container okay and
inside the container what I'm going to
do guys I'm going to put the heading so
as you can see the UI all over here so
in the UI it says a task manager there's
a container first you have to analyze
this and this container has a heading
which says task manager then there is a
label inside where basically a text
field where you can add a task and there
will be a button so let us create in our
index.html so guys as you can see here I
have created the container first div
class container and here I have given
the heading as task manager H1 so if I
just change something like this you
would see that it's still like this
thing will be gone so guys as you can
see all over here I have an H1 heading
with the H1 tag as task manager then
there is a text field which I've shown
you then there is a text field all over
here guys with the input type text ID
task input and there's a placeholder
which says add a new task then there's a
button on click which says that add a
task okay now the functionality of this
button is mentioned in the Java script
code and here it is add task so if I
take you to the UI you could see all
over here let us delete everything okay
so H1 tag is for the task manager then
there is a input text field which is
given all over here okay there's a ID
task input and I have applied a
placeholder also which says add a new
task so placeholder means something like
which is visible all over here so you
can overwrite this and if it's empty it
says add a new task so so that's what
placeholder means now guys let us see
what's the next thing we have created
the button now on clicking the button
okay there's a functionality added okay
and this functionality or this function
like adding a task it's been mentioned
in the Javascript file which is
script.js so we have to complete this
function okay now then I have created a
task list with the given unorder list
with his ID as task list so suppose if
I'm adding
uh suppose say let me show you so
suppose I have added a task
music okay now I have created
Sports okay so all these files are
getting updated one by one so the
unordered list is keeping adding as we
are adding up the task so that's what
logic I have written all over here that
with a particular ID of the task which
we are adding okay so this should be
added in the unordered list now so this
is our front end part and it's complete
just few four or five lines of code okay
now you can see all over here there's a
script.js file which is basically for
styling so let us look how we have
styled our components okay now for
styling purposes what I have targeted
with the class name see how our
container is going to look like
container means guys the this end part
the white end part is called container
okay so let us see how we can add the
code or how we can style it using C CSS
so guys all over here we have style. CSS
okay now it's completely empty let's
populate this file so in the style. CSS
I have something called container okay
so there's a body okay let's add first
about the body which is a default code
only so let's copy
this and paste it all over
here
okay now the next code should be of
container so if I see the container we
have the maximum width we have the
margin we have the background color we
have the Border radius the Box Shadow
and the padding these are the various
attributes that I've applied to my
container so that my container looks
like this okay now similarly I have
applied my H1 tag and you can see my H1
tag is kind of blue color so see the
primary color dark color is mentioned
now this is a variable which I've used
as a variable and this variable has been
declared all over here which is blue
primary color is given the blue color
with RGB coding 1976 D2 okay very easy
now similarly for the input types how I
have styled so input types means this
one okay this how we have uh you can say
styled our label so let us see so for
styling the label I have put out that
input type should be text okay the width
I have calculated using the caly
function and it range is around 100%
which say is approximately to 80 pixels
now I have Mar margin bottom which is 10
pixels the Border radius is 5 pixels and
the font size is 16 pixels now if I talk
about the button guys let us see how we
have styled our button so you can see
the button has a padding the background
color which is a blue color then the
color is white okay the border is none
cursor is pointer the Border radius they
have given something like 5 pixels and
the transition color is 0.3 seconds with
the background color
okay so let's see how this effect is
being applied so when we are hovering it
you can see the color is changing okay
now when I'm clicking on this it says
please enter a task okay now when you
click on this it's it's a kind of a
responsive styling we have given all
over here so which includes like
say the transition most importantly and
then we have given what could be the
font size which I have been written it's
16 pixels little bit of Border radius
and the background color we have given
as blue very easy now for hovering it I
have changed this to primary dark color
okay this is the primary color primary
color that means blue the dark primary
color is a dark version of this which
means this color now for the UL you can
see the unorder list which is something
like the list stle type so you can see
the unordered list style type is none
the padding is zero okay then for the
Ali part align means the list okay for
the list we have given the padding the
margin bottom okay the background color
the display how to justify the content
so we want the content in the center
okay so and similarly the font size has
been given as 16 pixels so this is all
the attributes that we have styled for
our Alli component or Alli element now
when your task is completed okay suppose
let me show you so suppose this task is
completed so there's a button all over
here okay and I have added this logic
with the help of JavaScript okay this is
an interactive logic it's not mentioned
in the index.html part okay because this
is coming dynamically and as you add the
task this button pops up now let us see
the completed so you can see the text
decoration is line through the color is
you can say the color is uh this shows
this type of color do add uh the hexa
value is 88888 and something like this
NE you can say a dark gray color
then there's a delete button with an
accent color so accent color is this we
have initialized our accent color
primary dark color this is the accent
dark color this is accent light color
so here you have the accent color also
then for the delete button H so when you
hover over it it will become dark color
similarly the for the completion button
it's been shown to the green and for the
button to hold it's been added as you
can say green color
but we have not added all these
functionalities uh we have not added
this style this is for your external if
you want to improve the UI you can add
these functionalities also so let me
show you what I mean to say suppose if I
H all over here the color is changing
now when I'm clicking this the UI should
be green okay so the button changes
color to Green now that logic is about
uh you can improve on this UI and you
can take this small project and uh build
your skills in HTML ncss now the most
and the foremost important part that
comes the JavaScript now how we are
going to add the interactivity now we
have created a UI but it doesn't adds up
the new task right now since two files
we have only created the first one is
HTML and second one is the CSS part now
when we are going to write our
Javascript file which means that we are
going to add the interactivity so guys
in the part two video we are going to
create the interactive file how we can
make our application Interactive with
the help of JavaScript so guys watch
this second part also if you want to
learn how we can complete this task
