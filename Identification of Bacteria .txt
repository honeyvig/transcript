hello everyone hope you all are doing
good so this video mainly focuses on
staining techniques and the Culture
Media used for the bacteria so as you
all know when it comes to staining
techniques the gram staining is the most
commonly used for differentiating the
large group of bacteria that is gram
positive and gram negative so here the
procedure is important to know so there
are the four steps present in gram
staining that is application of the
crystal violet which is the first step
that is primary stain so crystal violet
is a purple dye which is used and the
second step in gram staining is
application of iodine which acts like a
modern that means fixing the primary
step so it fixes the primary stain and
after the application of primary stain
that is crystal wallet and the secondary
step that is application of iodine the
alcohol wash is done which acts as a D
staining procedure that is
decolorization and the last step is
application of counter stain that is
safranin which is pink in color so the
summary is the bacteria which retains
the primary stain that is the crystal
violet are considered to be gram
positive bacteria and the bacteria which
loses the primary stain and takes up the
counter stain is gram-negative bacteria
so here you can see in the bottom of the
slide the view of gram-positive and
gram-negative bacteria on the
microscopic slide so the bacteria which
retains the primary strain curve that is
purple that is crystal violet is
considered to be gram positive whereas
the bacteria which is pink in color
which takes up safranin is gram-negative
bacteria
so the reason for gram-positive bacteria
which doesn't get decal raised is the
thick peptidoglycan layer so that the
thick peptidoglycan layer makes it
retain the primary stain that is crystal
wallet so that it appears purple or blue
in color whereas the gram-negative
bacteria does not have thick
peptidoglycan layer it loses the primary
stain and takes up the counter strain
that is safranin so these are the
examples of gram positive bacteria only
so this is the mnemonic for gram
positive bacteria that is strange stuff
is at least entered my new carry bag is
the mnemonic for remembering gram
positive bacteria examples so the bold
letters that is dark black letters
represents a bacteria so strange for
streptococcus Steffie Staphylococcus act
for act no - list for Listeria entered
that is Enterococcus my for a micro
bacteria new for pneumococcus carry for
corynebacterium and bag for bacillus so
strange stuff is at least entered my new
carry bag is a mnemonic for gram
positive bacteria moving on to the other
staining technique that is acid fast
staining also called as ZL nielsen
staining procedure so in this it is also
included with four steps that is
application of primary stain that is
carbon question and instead of using
iodine here the slide is heated which
acts like a modern that is fixated so
application of heat is animating step
between gram staining and acid first and
the third is the same that is
application of acid alcohol which acts
as a decal raiser and the final is
application of methylene blue that is
counter stain so acid first bacteria are
mainly done for micro
bacterium that reason for that is
because of the presence of my colic
acids in the cell wall so high amount of
my chronic acids present in the cell
wall so that's why gram staining is not
preferred for micro bacterium as it
first training is preferred so the
summary of this staining technique is
the acid fast bacteria because of
presence of high mykola gases they do
not get decolorized they appear bright
red in color whereas the known as it
first bacteria takes up the counter
stain that is methylene blue so here is
a clear picture of gram positive gram
negative and acid fast bacteria so here
you can see gram positive bacteria has a
thick peptidoglycan layer whereas
gram-negative bacteria has thin
peptidoglycan layer and like important
feature of gram-negative bacteria is
presence of outer membrane and as it
first bacteria you can see parents of
high mycolic acid content coming to the
bacterial growth curve many questions
are urged regarding this growth curve so
there are four phases in bacterial
growth curve that is lag phase
logarithmic phase stationary phase and
death phase so the important events
occurring in these phases are very
important so the events that are
occurring in the first phase that is lag
phase are adaptation of the bacteria to
this environment and the maximum cell
size is attained by the bacteria by the
end of this logarithm log lag phase
whereas the second phase that is
logarithmic phase is also called as
exponential phase here the cells are
stained uniformly and the bactericidal
drugs are more active in this
logarithmic phase the third phase is
stationary phase because there is zero
growth rate
and the important feature that happens
here is the sporulation
and the final phase is the death phase
that is the phase of decline and the
involution forms are more common in this
death phase so please remember lag phase
logarithmic phase also called as
exponential phase stationary phase also
called as zero growth rate phase and
death phase also called as phase of
decline moving on to the culture media
so culture media you need to remember
the media name and the bacteria example
so the main users of culture media is
the primary uses to identify the
bacteria that is cause of infection from
a given clinical sample so if you
identify the perfect bacteria given in
the king and sample the clinician can
suggest the proper drug against it so
that the proper treatment can be given
and it is also used to study the
characteristics and the properties of
the microorganisms and last but not
least is to prepare biological products
like vaccines so there are the three
types of Culture Media it can be either
solid liquid or semi solid please
remember solid consists of agar so if
you add 2 percent of agar to the Culture
Media it is considered to be a solid
media if there is no agar in the medium
it is considered to be liquid medium and
if there is a less concentration of agar
like 0.2 to 0.5 this semi solid so
whenever there is agar mentioned in the
given Culture Media that means it is
solid in nature whenever there is broth
mentioned it is liquid invention
and there are aerobic and anaerobic
medians aerobic media is for the
bacteria which can easily grow in the
presence of oxygen whereas anaerobic
media which cannot be grown in the
presence of oxygen the examples of
anaerobic media are commonly us that is
robertson cooked meat broth and taiyo
glycolate medium coming to the
classification so calcium in a glass fed
into simple complex and synthetic media
so simple media the examples of simple
media nutrient broth or nutrient agar so
new tentacle is nothing but a guarded -
nutrient broth so 2 percent of agar
added to nutrient broth makes it
nutrient agar apart from simple media
their synthetic and complex media so you
need to know the difference between
synthetic and complex
synthetic media contain ingredients for
which complete chemical formula is known
that is example is if Pepitone water is
used as a media it is considered as
synthetic medium because complete
chemical formula is known it consists of
1% peptone 0.5 percent sodium chloride
in water whereas complex media the
chemical formula is not perfectly known
such as milk egg malt and animal dishes
are added so perfect chemical
composition is not known in complex
media where a synthetic media also
called as defined media the chemical
composition of every component is well
known so we will discuss about different
complex media which are very very
important regarding need so the first
one is enriched media so here you can
remember n reached the d stands for
solid so enriched media is already in
nature so as I told you the examples
of solid media should contain agar
so whichever media consists of agar in
it mostly come under enriched media so
blood agar chocolate agar and LeFleur
serum slope comes under enriched media
that is solid in nature so difference
between blood agar and chocolate agar so
the appearance can be seen here so blood
agar consists of mammalian blood
chocolate agar also contain red blood
cells that have been lized
by slow heating to 80 degree Celsius so
played agar is more mostly used to
detect the hemolytic pattern of the
bacteria very very important so blood
agar is a agar used for detecting
fastidious organisms or to isolate them
and to detect the hemolytic pattern of
the bacteria so this is the hemolysis
pattern so there are three types of
hemolytic pattern you can see beta
hemolysis alpha hemolysis and gamma
hemolysis in the diagram you can see
beta hemolysis means complete lysis of
the red blood cells there as alpha
hemolysis is partial lysis of the red
blood cells whereas gamma hemolysis you
can see there is no lysis of red blood
cells
so alpha hemolysis you can see there is
partial hemolysis the greenish colonies
are seen in alpha hemolysis so that is
the point to be noted so beta hemolysis
is complete hemolysis alpha is partial
hemolysis and gamma is no hemolysis so
these are the examples of different
hemolytic patterns beta hemolytic
streptococcus pyogenes alpha is e---coli
and gamma that is no hemolysis
Staphylococcus epidermis
moving on to the second complex meter
that is enrichment medium so enriched
media is solid in nature whereas
enrichment media is liquid in nature so
it is also called as liquid selective
medium so as I told you if it consists
of broth that if the example consists of
broth in the name it is considered to be
liquid in nature so enrichment media is
nothing but liquid in nature the
examples are tetra thionite broth which
is mainly for Salmonella cell native
broth which is my first Salmonella and
shegella whereas alkaline peptone water
is for Librium so there are three
examples of enrichment medium so blood
agar chocolate agar Loffler serum slope
are examples of enriched media which are
solid in nature whereas tetra thinit
broth selenite f broth and alkaline
crypto water are examples of enrichment
media which are liquid invention the
third is selective media so enrichment
media is also a type of selective media
but liquid in nature whereas selective
media is solid in nature so the examples
of selective media is thiosulfate
citrate bile salt sucrose Agha that is
tcbs for rib rio the Bernstein's
Jenson's media for micro bacterium
tuberculosis
so with in selective media there is
substance that is added to slow down the
growth of specific bacteria and only the
bacteria that is tend to grow is grown
that is in tcbs it enhances the growth
of Vibrio whereas in LJ media that is
the one shinkansen media now let's eat
green dye which is present Awards
of other bacteria and enhances the
growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and
the other example of selective media is
ther marked in medium apart from PCBs
and LJ media ther marked in medium also
included under selective area so ther
Martin median is nothing but as you can
see in the diagram it is a chocolate
agar with added vancomycin and missed
rattle that is anti bacterial Sony Syria
is an example for ther Martin medium so
a Syria is grown on they are marked in
middle moving on to the indicator media
so the name itself suggests the media
contains an indicator that is color
indicator which changes in color when
the bacteria grow in them so the
examples of indicator media is builds
and Blair medium and Mike Loades made
him so here you can see in the diagram
the Wilson Blair medium because of the
growth of the bacteria the sulphide is
converted into sulfide that is black
metallic colonists so because of the
growth of Salmonella typhi the sulfide
is converted into sulfide so Wilson and
Blair medium is for Salmonella typhi
whereas metalloids medium for
corynebacterium diphtheria
so here the potassium daily rate is
reduced to metallic delirium so whenever
there is a change in color it is
considered to be indicator media so
Salmonella typhi is indicated by growth
of black color black color colonist in
Wilson and blade medium whereas
corynebacterium diphtheria in McClure
it's medium
and differential medium so it is used to
distinguish between the bacteria that is
lactose fermenting or non lactose
fermenters so McConkey saga is an
example for differential medium so here
you can see the lactose fermenting
bacteria appears pink in color whereas
non lactose fermenters appears colorless
and the final Culture Media is transport
medium so it is used to transport the
organism from the lab from the
collecting area so the examples of
transport medium is Cary Blair for
Salmonella she's ill and Vibrio whereas
Stuart's medium for transportation of go
knock okay so it is used to preserve the
particular type of bacteria and also
prevents the growth of unwanted bacteria
during the transport from the collecting
area to the laboratory so the examples
are clearly Blair and stores carry Blair
for Salmonella she jail and Vibrio
whereas towards medium for going off
okay and there are specific media for
fungal growth the main and most commonly
used ISA Burroughs glucose or agar are
sub rods dextrose agar and inhibitory
molar these two are important for the
growth of fungus most commonly asked
question is suburbs Dijkstra Sagara sub
rods glucose aha they are related to the
fungal growth
