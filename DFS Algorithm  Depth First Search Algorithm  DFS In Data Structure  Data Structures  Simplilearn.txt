hello everyone welcome to simply learn's
youtube channel in this session we will
learn about depth first search algorithm
but before we begin i would like to tell
you guys that we have daily updates on
multiple technologies if you are a tech
geek in a continuous hunt for latest
technological trends then please
consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn
now without further ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
discussion
so in this session for today first we
will understand about a brief
introduction to depth first search
followed by that we will look into an
example for dfs algorithm so i hope i
made myself clear with the agenda now
let's get started with the introduction
to depth first search
so what is a depth first search so
basically a depth first search is an
algorithm for traversing or searching
the tree or graph data structures the
algorithm starts at the root note
selecting some arbitrary node as the
root note in case of graph and x plots
as far as possible along each branch
before backtracking
so dfs starts with the initial node of
the graph then goes deeper until it
finds the goal nodes or the leaf nodes
or the nodes that have no children that
is the end part here you can see 4 and 7
are the leaf nodes so the depth first
search algorithm runs till the end of
all the nodes that is 8 10 all these are
the
leaf nodes or the last gold nodes
in dfs the backtracking starts once all
the nodes are explored
and the dfs algorithm uses stack data
structure for its traversal now that was
a brief introduction to the dfs
algorithm now for a better understanding
let's go through a practical example
so here we have a graph data structure
with elements a b
c
d
e and f so we will be running the dfs
algorithm and we will be traversing
through all the nodes of this particular
graph and the traversal will be recorded
using a stack data structure and we have
two different colors which will be used
to indicate the element's color
so the black color is for the nodes
which are not visited yet and the blue
color will indicate the nodes which are
being traversed already
now this is the stack data structure
that we will be using for the traversal
and we have another part which declares
or which gives out the output of the
traversal of the nodes of this
particular graph
now we will begin with the first one
that is a now followed by that we will
move ahead to b
then after b we will go through d
then after d we have e
next we have c and last we have f
so that's how we traverse through the
graph using the dfs algorithm
now for a little more understanding
let's go through a practical example
where we will be executing a program for
implementing the dfs algorithm
so this particular program on my screen
is an example for dfs algorithm so here
we have the structure node
so followed by that we have also the
methods which will create the edge
and which will also print the graph
elements and finally we have the main
class now don't worry about the code
this particular code segment or the
complete code document will be added in
the description box below and you can
have access to it and try to run it on
your local system and have a better
learning experience now without further
ado let's try to run this program and
get the output and see how the dfs
algorithm gets implemented and traverses
through the graph
there you go the program got
successfully executed and we had the
graph elements that is 0 1 and 2 and 3
so it has visited all the elements that
is 2 3 1 and 0 according to the stack
data structure and we have found the
output over here
so with that we have come to an end of
this tutorial on dfs algorithm if you
have any queries regarding the topics
covered in this particular session then
please feel free to let us know in the
comment section below and our team of
experts will be happy to resolve all
your queries until next time thank you
