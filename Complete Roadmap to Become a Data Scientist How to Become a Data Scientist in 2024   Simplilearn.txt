the agenda for today's session first we
will understand what is data science
followed by that we will dive into the
need for data science next ahead we have
the important roles and responsibilities
of a data scientist moving ahead we will
discuss the critical skills required to
become a data scientist then the
important point of today's session that
is the road map to become a data
scientist next we will will discuss the
salary of a data scientist in USA and in
India and finally we will wrap up the
session by understanding the major
companies hiring data scientists now
let's start with the first point that is
what is data science data science is a
multidisciplinary field that uses
scientific methods algorithms processes
and systems to extract knowledge and
insights from structured and
unstructured data it combines expertise
from computer science statistics do main
knowledge and data visualization to
solve complex problems and make data
driven decisions and predict future
outcomes data scientists collect clean
analyze and interpret data uncovering
valuable patterns and Trends they also
develop machine learning models and use
data to inform business strategies
scientific research and various
applications ranging from Healthcare and
finance to marketing and Beyond in a
sense data science empowers
organizations and individuals to harness
the power of data for informed decision
making and Innovation moving ahead we
will understand the need for data
science firstly we will understand the
data abundance in today's digital Age We
generate and store vast amount of data
every second data science helps us make
sense of this abundance by extracting
valuable insights from it enabling
better decision making next is
complexity of data data comes in various
formats including text images and sensor
data data science techniques such as
machine learning and natural language
processing are essential for handling
and analyzing this diverse and complex
data moving ahead we have competitive
Advantage organizations that effectively
leverage data science gain a Competitive
Edge they can optimize operations
enhance customer experiences and develop
products and services tailored to their
marketing needs moving ahead we have
scientific Discovery data science plays
a pivotal role in scientific research
from geonomics to climate modeling it
accelerates the pace of Discovery by
processing and analyzing large data sets
to uncover hidden patterns and
relationships followed by that we have
fraud detection and security data
science is crucial for identifying and
preventing fraudulent activities in
various Industries such as finance and
cyber security Advanced algorithms can
detect anomalies and susp
patterns in real time in summary data
science is indispensable in our
datadriven world helping us harness
data's power to make informed decisions
Drive Innovation and address complex
challenges across various domains moving
ahead we will discuss the important
roles and responsibilities of a data
scientist we have six important roles
and responsibilities which are data
collection and cleaning exploratory data
analysis model developing data visual
ization feature engineering continuous
learning and optimization let us
understand each one of these starting
with data collection and cleaning data
scientists are responsible for acquiring
collecting and cleaning data sets this
involves sourcing data from various
databases apis or other resources and
ensuring its quality by handling missing
values outliners and
inconsistencies next is exploratory data
analysis or also called as Eda data
scientists perform Eda to gain a deep
understanding of data they use
statistical and visual Technologies to
and visualization Technologies to
identify patterns correlations and
outliners which inform subsequent
analysis moving ahead we have model
development developing predictive models
is a core responsibility data scientists
build machine learning models to solve
specific business or research problems
selecting appropriate algorithms and
fine-tuning them for for Optimal
Performance moving ahead we have data
visualization data scientists create
informative data visualizations and
reports to communicate findings and
insights to non-technical stakeholders
effective visualization is crucial for
making datadriven decisions followed by
that we have feature engineering feature
engineering involves selecting creating
or transforming relevant variables to
improve model accuracy data scientists
are skilled in identifying which
features are most informative for a
given problem next continuous learning
and
optimization data science field evolves
rapidly data scientists must stay
updated with the latest tools and
Technologies and they often need to
retain models and optimize algorithms as
new data becomes available or business
goals change in addition to these
primary responsibilities data scientists
May collap collaborate with cross
functional teams communicate results
effectively and ensure that data
analysis aligns with organizational
objectives their role is crucial in
extracting actionable insights from data
to drive informed decision making moving
ahead we will discuss the important
skills required to become a data
scientists firstly we have programming
next statistics followed by that machine
learning and data manipulation next
ahead we have data visualization and
lastly domain knowledge we will discuss
each one of these starting with
programming a strong foundation and
Proficiency in programming languages
like python or R is fundamental for data
scientists they use these languages to
manipulate data build machine learning
models and develop data analysis scripts
next is statistics and Mathematics a
strong foundation in statistics and
Mathematics is essential for
understanding testing and machine
learning algorithms moving ahead we have
machine learning data scientists should
have expertise in machine learning
techniques including supervised and
unsupervised learning deep learning and
reinforcement learning included they
need to choose train and evaluate models
effectively moving ahead we have data
manipulation skills in data processing
cleaning and transformation are crucial
data scientists work with messy and
complex data sets so the ability to
prepare data for analysis is also a key
skill moving ahead we have data
visualization proficient data
visualization skills help data
scientists communicate their findings
effectively to both Technical and
non-technical stakeholders tools like
matplot lip cbon or tblu are commonly
used moving ahead we have domain
knowledge understanding the specific
industry or domain in which they work is
valuable domain knowledge allows data
scientists to ask relevant questions
identify meaningful patterns and provide
actionable insights in addition to these
effective communication problem solving
abilities and adaptability are also
important qualities for a data scientist
being able to translate Data Insights
into actionable recommendations is a key
aspect of the rule moving ahead we have
the data scientist road map becoming a
data scientist is rewarded Journey that
requires dedication and a structured
approach here is a comprehensive road
map of 10 steps that will help you so we
will discuss each one of these steps in
detail starting with the first one which
is prerequisites in the first step the
first point is Educational Foundation
