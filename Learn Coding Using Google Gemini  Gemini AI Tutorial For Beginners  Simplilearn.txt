so hello everyone my name is m and
welcome to the simply Lear YouTube
channel today we will be covering topic
how to learn coding using Gemini so now
let's move on to the Gemini prompt so
this is our screen of
Gemini okay so here first I will
write hey
Gemini I want to
learn coding
so it will give us some basic prompts
so it gave like learning to code is a
fantastic design it's valuable skill
that can open doors to many
opportunities so here is a path right so
first find your motivation then pick
your first language then explore online
resources then in online resources there
are some categories like online courses
video tutorials coding websites practice
consistently and you can build project
or you can join the community okay so
here now I will
ask give me
some
beginner
friendly
coding
languages
okay so here it gave like python
JavaScript scratch I don't know this
Lang this scratch if you are entirely
new to coding or even introducing coding
to Children scratch is a fantastic
option okay so here is python JavaScript
or you need more you can ask more
languages right it will provide you more
basically you can ask anything uh to the
Gemini so here are more Ruby CA Swift
HTML and CSS so uh we will take HTML
because because HTML is a foundation
language for the web pages or web
development you can say or you can
choose any of the languages you want so
here I will write give me
study plan to
learn learn
STM language
right so now it will provide us a proper
week uh wise study plan so so here you
can okay I can ask phase two phase one
so for what I will do I will stop it and
I will ask give me week wise study
plan okay so here is a quick info for
you if you want to switch careers with
AI and ml then try giving simply learn
postgraduate program in Ai and machine
learning from bir University in
collaboration with Iva this course
teaches in demand skills such as machine
learning Lear deep learning NLP computer
vision reinforcement learning generative
AI prompt engineering J GT and many more
so don't forget to check out the course
link from the description box below and
the pin comments so here you can see so
here is a we biwe stml study plan
beginner to building website so this
plan offers a more structured approach
to with dedicated activities for each so
week one foundations of HTML in which
activities are the understanding code
concept of HTML like hyper text market
like stdl full form and its role in web
development right some resources are
there and video tutorial you can watch
and website is there like week do coding
your first web page okay set up Simple
Text Editor for or a free code editor
like visual code Studio code right and
resources from here you can get let me
ask I want I
want we WI
topics right because I don't want to go
in every particular website or theour G
okay so here are the topics what is HTML
we do coding your first topics like HTML
Cod writing B HL structure elements and
attributes okay then topics estim
elements like list tables forms in week
three and in week four uh you will Deep
dive into
CSS right
and here I will
write
provide okay because I want particular
like paragraph tag or BR tag is there
then heading tags are there so I want
that with all the tags
name
right this is how you can learn HTML
okay or you can choose any of your prer
language right now you can see see week
one HTML Basics and essential tags like
HTML tag head tag body tag heading tags
and this is paragraph tag
right and here week to Concepts uh
writing basic HTML code adding comments
okay then list tables images how you can
add list using this tab and for the
table TR and TD rows and cells TR means
table rows and
table okay then ulol unordered list and
ordered list and we these are form input
table then we for introduction to CSS
then you will learn CSS right so here if
you want to learn let's take heading tab
so give me
brief
introduction of
heading tags STM right so it will give
some brief introduction on how you can
apply uh this heading tags to your
particular script HTML script or HTML
index sheet you can see see this is how
you can uh this is a brief introduction
of purpose of this heading tag heading
text Define the structure and the
hierarchy of headings within your web
page then the types are H1 to H6
according to the size you can say and
the structure search engines and the
browser and this is the example see with
example you just you can just copy code
and you can paste it to your visual code
Studio or whatever the ID you are
using right the best prac is us use only
one H1 tag for the main heading for your
web page because H1 tag is the bigger
one okay so this is how you can learn
week wise or any coding languages so now
I
want give me basic
website
code okay so it will give me basic
website code for the
stml or you if you want to learn C++ C
or Java you can ask anything to Gemini
it will give you the see so here is an
example of basic website code so you can
just copy it and you can paste it to
your particular file document file or
visual code Studio see here is a let's
break down the code do type stml this is
a doc type HTML it is used for this is
the inline declares the document type as
a HTML then HTML type here is the HTML
type right so this tag is not root
element of the particular St document so
head tag is their title why title this T
Define the title displayed on the
browser tab browser tab is this here you
can see the Gemini is here like this
like the body then H1 tag then P tag
then a tag hyperlink tag right that
image you can insert for using IMG T
then source file SRC right or what if
you want to learn any uh coding program
so
h i Am
[Music]
to C++
language and
even
numbers okay so it will give you the
code how to find odd and even numbers or
you can do if you have any codes so you
can copy paste here and you can debug it
right you can also do that so here you
can right see absolutely here is a C++
for to find odd and even number see
nothing you have to do just you have to
just copy it and you can paste it to
your ID and you can run it okay so here
you can see the explanation see hash
include iio stream that this line
includes the I input output stream
header file which provides input and
output functional in C++ see using name
space s so here you can see this
statement avoids repeatedly using stdp
for standard Library elements like C out
and C C Out means output and input for
this then int main is there in number
then enter integer prom the user to
enter in particular okay so this is how
you can learn any
coding using Gemini whether you you are
a beginner or you are you are an expert
for the particular language you can
learn anything right with this we have
