hi everyone welcome to this interesting
video tutorial on doctor simul vice hand
washing case study using python
in this video i'll make you understand
how analytics is being used to solve
business problems in healthcare
we look at a real-world case study in
healthcare using python programming
this case study dates back to the mid
19th century we will learn how a doctor
could solve a very critical problem in
europe during the 19th century by
analyzing past data so let's begin
so now we are going to look at
healthcare market forecast
so as per
marketsandmarkets.com
the healthcare analytics market is
projected to reach 75.1 billion us
dollars by 2026 from 21.1 billion us
dollars in 2021.
now talking about
india
statista.com
india's healthcare sector was about 160
billion us dollars in 2017
it was estimated to reach up to 372
billion us dollars by 2022.
as per rbc capital markets approximately
30 percent of the world's data is
generated by the healthcare industry
by 2025 the compound annual growth rate
of data in healthcare will reach 36
percent now that is six percent faster
than manufacturing 10 percent faster
than financial services and 11 faster
than media and entertainment
now let's see the various applications
and issues that analytics can solve in
healthcare
we will look at drug discovery
staffing and operation
and see how analytics can help predict
diseases
so talking about
drug discovery
now the drug discovery is a very long
process sometimes it takes about 12
years and costs way too much about 2.6
billion us dollars
now data analytics can increase the drug
delivery process rate in medical science
helping to gain faster approval from the
food and drug administration
it can help optimize and improve the
efficiency of clinical trials
another key development that has
happened in a number of pharmaceutical
companies like astrazeneca
bayer cleansing
and jensen research and development has
recently announced a data sharing
initiative called project
data sphere
these companies have agreed to share
historical cancer research data to help
researchers in the fight against the
disease today
the database will be available online
globally and the analytics technology
would be provided by software vendor sas
now moving on
we have
staffing and operation
now this is another crucial problem that
every staff manager in hospital faces
that is the problem of staff allocations
at a given period
understanding how many people a manager
should put on a staff at any given time
period can be very challenging if you
put too many workers the risk of having
unnecessary labor costs go up
too few workers you can have poor
customer service outcomes
which can be fatal for patients
so business analysts can use data to
forecast patient admission trends at
specific times of the day and provide
insights to the staff managers to assign
the right number of staff during peak
and slow periods
next
we'll talk about predicting diseases
so business analytics can also predict
trends in the spread of illness allowing
doctors
hospitals medical staff and individuals
to adequately prepare themselves for
example in the case of coronavirus
analyzing data to predict future spikes
in cases can help hospitals ensure the
staff have enough protective equipment
and patient beds
using medical imaging and algorithms
physicians can detect diabetic
retinopathy which is a condition that
damages the eye due to diabetes and
algorithms can also help detect cancer
cells in a patient
detecting cancer at an early stage has
been a focused area in healthcare for
quite some time now
the cancer moonshot initiative by former
u.s president barack obama initiated in
his second term relies on advanced
analytical techniques to pace up the
discovery of cancer cures by identifying
the trends and treatments used worldwide
that have the highest success rate
now
let's look at the hand washing case
study in detail
so to give you some context
before the
mid 19th century
the science of bacteria was not
discovered yet
nobody knew that microorganisms could
spread diseases
back then even hospital staff did not
follow basic hygiene practices
not even doctors cared to wash their
hands
to be honest we all realized the
importance of hand washing after the
world was hit by coronavirus pandemic
now meet
dr
ignaz simelweis
he was a hungarian-born doctor and
practiced at the vienna general
hospital's maternity clinic between 1846
and 1849
dr simelweis is regarded as the father
of infection control for discovering the
medical benefits of hand washing
dr simelweis was very disturbed by the
increasing fatality rate of mothers from
child bed fever at vienna hospital so
child bed fever is also known as
pure peril fever
it happens due to infections in the
female reproductive tract following
childbirth
this child fever was an issue of concern
throughout europe with some hospitals
having over 40 percent mortality rate so
out of every 100 mothers who used to
give birth at least 40 mothers would die
in a week or two weeks time
so the demo case study i am going to
present now concerns the work of dr
ignac's symbol wise in reducing the risk
of childbirth fever during childbirth in
vienna hospital during the mid 19th
century so he collected and analyzed
historical data on deaths in his clinic
and established a theory of what was
contributing to increasing deaths of
mothers
now to solve a problem business analysts
would often need to collect data from
multiple sources for this demo we'll be
using three data sets that are publicly
accessible on kegel and github let me
go ahead and show you the three data
sets first
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scale up by simply learn
click on the link in the description to
know more
okay so this is the first data set that
i have which is called the yearly fever
mortality data set so here you can see
the first column is about year it starts
from
1784
and it goes till
1846
the next column we have is about the
total number of births that took place
at the vienna general hospital maternity
clinic and then we have the total number
of deaths reported from child bed fever
next then we have the
fever mortality per clinic so
in the vienna hospital there were two
separate clinics that operated between
1833 and 1846
birth one
column represents the total number of
births that took place
in clinic one similarly
that's one column represents the total
number of deaths that took place in
clinic one of the maternity clinic at
vienna general hospital births two and
that's two
has the information about the births and
deaths that happened in clinic two
then we have our final data set this
data set is about
monthly debts which starts from
january
1841
till
march
1849
we have the total number of births and
the total number of deaths and this
monthly underscore deaths is only for
clinic one
we'll learn in detail about clinic one
and clinic two at the maternity hospital
and what they represent in detail
all right
okay
so
this is my jupyter notebook which has
the
lines of code already written i'm going
to explain you each cell of code and
we'll explore
the hand washing case study by looking
at the outputs for each of the cells
let's start with the first cell
so here i'm going to import my first
data set which is the
yearly fever
motility
this is a csv data set
and to
load the data set i'm using the pandas
library and the read underscore csp
function
i am using
parse underscore
dates equal to
year so this
parse underscore dates will format the
year column in the form of a date value
next
i have
set
my index to be the year column you can
see here set underscore index
equal to year and i am mentioning that
in place equal to true which means that
the original data is now modified and
updated in place
and i'm importing the data
and storing it in a variable called
yearly underscore that's
next i'm going to print my
data set
let me just
hit
shift enter
we can see the result
there is an error here it says
okay this should be yearly underscore
deaths
let me run it again
there you go
so here you can see we have set the year
column as our index
you can see the year column is our index
then we have the
other two columns the total number of
births and the total number of deaths
starting from
1784
till
1846 all right
now
you can see
the values for year total births and the
total number of deaths from 1784 till
1846 in the maternity clinic of vienna
hospital where similvoice used to
practice
coming to the
next cell of code
here
we are going to calculate the mortality
rate or the mortality percentage for
that i'm going to create a new column
called as
mortality
so here i'm mentioning my data frame
which is yearly underscore deaths that
we created above and then within square
brackets i am passing in my new column
name which is mortality
and the
formula to calculate mortality is
total
deaths
divided by
the total number of births into hundred
now let's print the result
you can see here we have added a new
column called mortality and it has given
us the
mortality rate for
each of the years starting from 1784
till 1846
now next
we are
going to find out some descriptive
statistics using the describe function
so i've used yearly underscore deaths
dot describe
if i run it you can see the
count that is the total number of
rows that are there in our
data set
then we have the
mean birth
so the
average birth
that has taken place in all these years
per year is around 2268.
the total debts reported in each of the
years that is the average number of
deaths is around 93 and the mortality is
around three percent or 3.3 percent we
have the standard deviation
we have the
minimum value that is the
least births that took place in one of
the years was
284 and the maximum is 4010
then we have the 25th percentile the
50th percentile and the 75th percentile
we are going to create our first plot
that is
taught about yearly mortality rate each
year between
1784 till 1846
now here we are going to create a line
plot and for that i'm going to import my
matplotlib dot pi plot as plt
i'm setting my figure size to be 14
comma 5
and using the plot function i'm going to
create my line plot
i've given my
data value as mortality rate i'm going
to use
color as green and marker as
o so o will represent as dots and after
that i am going to give a title as
mortality from child bed fever during
childbirth i have given a x label as
year and y label as mortality rate let's
run and see the output
there you go
if i scroll down
you can see here we have a nice
line chart
now we can notice that the mortality
rate started increasing somewhere around
1823
from here you can see a spike
and gradually the
mortality rate or fatality rate from
childbed fever started increasing from
around 1823
the reason was you can see here there
was a sharp increase after
1823
so the reason
was
around 1823
civil wise clinic started giving lessons
on
pathological anatomy
so
pathology i guess you would know is the
branch of medicine that deals with the
study of
causes and effects of diseases
so doctors would take classes on the
corpses organs and tissues to learn the
reasons for the cause of the death
so after the post mortems then they
might deliver a baby or examine a
patient
possibly with pieces of contaminated
flesh remaining in their hands
so similar wise suspected that this
could be the reason for childbed fever
he continued with his analysis and
looked for further evidence to support
his hypothesis
not till
1832 there was only one maternity clinic
at the vienna hospital
now that had become very overcrowded so
an extension was built and two clinics
were created in
1833 you can see it here
now until
1840
both clinics were used for teaching and
training medical students and midwives
so midwives are people who help mothers
deliver babies and take care of newborns
after childbirth
so after 1840
the physicians
that included doctors and medical
students used to operate in clinic one
and only midwives used to operate in
clinic 2 after 1840
so similwise spotted that in clinic one
the fatality rate for mothers from
childbed fever was three times more than
those who delivered in clinic two
so you can see here in clinic one which
was the doctor's word
and for people
who were given trainings the mortality
rate was ten percent while in clinic two
where only the midwives operated the
mortality rate was three percent
so he again believed that in clinic one
where doctors and physicians operated
they also used to handle corpses during
autopsies before operating on pregnant
women and they never used to wash their
hands between the two jobs
but midwives in clinic 2 never went to
the autopsy room so similarwise spotted
that there were links between the
lack of hygiene of the doctors and the
mortality rate of the mothers
so let's analyze that data now
cool
so i'm going to import my second data
set which has the information about
births and deaths in clinic one and
clinic two so here i'm importing my csv
data set and i'm storing it
in a data frame name called clinics
again i've used
parse underscore dates as year to format
the
date values i've given my
file location followed by the file name
and dot the extension of the file which
is csv file again i have set my index to
be the year column
and i'm printing the head of the data
frame now let me hit shift enter
okay so here you can see
1833 onwards
birth one death one that is for clinic
one then we have both two that's two for
clinic two
next
we are going to calculate the mortality
for both the clinics that is clinic one
and clinic two
so what i'm doing here is i'm creating
two columns mortality one and mortality
two so mortality one is for clinic one
then mortality two is for clinic two
again the formula is the same deaths
divided by births into 100 is the
mortality rate
let me run it
and now we are going to see the
first 10 rows from our newly created
data frame you can see here we have
added
two more columns mortality one and
mortality two
and these are the results
now if you notice
see the mortality rate
for the clinic one where
dr simmelweis used to practice
or the physicians who also operated on
the
dead bodies
used to practice so the mortality rate
is high there
now
let's compare
and visualize the mortality rate
at both the clinics so here i'm again
setting my figure size to be 14 comma
five
i've used
clinics dot index modality one i've
given a label as clinic one
color i'm using as steel marker is
o
so this o will make sure for each of the
years we have a
dot or a round shape
similarly for clinic two we have
mortality two i'm using
blue color again marker as o
then i'm giving a legend
a title called mortality from child bed
fever during childbirth i also have a
via label called mortality rate
let's run it
now if i scroll down you can see
the mortality rate
from
1833 onwards till
1846 for both the clinics
the teal color represents clinic one and
the blue color represents clinic two
so from this graph we can see that the
death rate at clinic 1 was significantly
higher after
1840 you can see there has
a huge spike
compared to clinic 2 where only the
midwives practiced and they never
operated on the dead bodies in the
autopsy room
so now dr simmelweis had strong evidence
to believe that the doctors were
transmitting infectious flesh or you can
say material substances from previous
operations to mothers through their
hands and this was leading to
childbirth fever
so far
we have seen in our analysis till
1846
and dr simeone vice in mid
1847 asked his colleagues and fellow
physicians at maternity clinic one to
wash their hands with chlorinated lyme
solution before attending pregnant
mothers and the results were significant
so let's see the final analysis of
clinic one where doctor simulates
practiced and how he was able to reduce
the mortality rate
now i'm going to load the
monthly debts data set that has
information from january 1841 till march
1849
and after 1849 his contract was
terminated and he was asked to leave the
vienna hospital i'll tell you why he was
asked to leave
a little later
let's load the final data set now
okay so
i'm going to import my final data set
which is the monthly underscore
csv i'm storing it
in a variable called monthly underscore
data
let me run it so here you can see
the
data for
all the months starting from
january 1841 till march 1849
next
i'm going to find the monthly
mortality at clinic one
so
i'm going to divide the deaths divided
by birds into 100
so here you can see we have created new
column called proportional underscore
debts
that has the
death rate for each of the months
now the doctors in clinic one started
washing their hands in june
1847 before carrying out delivery
operations
so
we have divided
the original data into two data frames
called
before washing and
then we have after washing
we will set the start of hand washing
date to
1st of june
1847
you can see here i have said
start of hand washing pandas dot 2 data
frame i am giving my
hand washing start date that is 1st of
june 1847
washing data frame will have all the
values that lie prior to june
1847 so here i have subset my data i'm
saying
date should be less than
a date which is 1st of june 1847 and
after washing should be
greater than equal to 1st of june 1847.
we run this
i'll print my before
washing data frame you can see
it has taken all the values till
may 1847
and for after washing we have all the
values starting from june 1847 till
we have march 1849
so we have split
months data into before and after hand
washing start date
now let's
plot our final
graph that shows the difference in the
mortality rate of mothers
before and after hand washing
so here
i am setting ax which is the axis
before washing
dot plot will create
a line plot i'm saying x to be date y to
be proportional deaths i'm giving my
label to be before hand washing i'm
using color
as c which is for cn
then here b represents blue
this is for after hand washing again x
should be date y should be proportional
underscore deaths
here i am using a line style to be
dotted lines to just
you know compare the
plots i have set my while label to be
proportioned that's let's run it
and you can see the
result
let me scroll down
there you go on the x axis we have the
date the y-axis we have the proportion
deaths
the
cn color represents before hand washing
that is the solid line and we have the
dotted lines for
after hand washing
now you can see how
starting from the summer of
1847 the proportion of deaths got
reduced significantly less than five
percent you can see here
so this was when civil wise made hand
washing
mandatory now
we'll calculate the difference in
average monthly percentage debts before
and after hand washing so what i'm doing
is i'm creating
two variables before proportion and
after proportion
and then we are going to subtract
before proportion mean minus the after
proportion mean if you see the
difference you can see here it is eight
point three percent so from
ten percent we just reduced it to less
than three percent
so this was all about the
hand washing case study that symbolwise
had conducted using different data sets
so we perform this explorative data
analysis using three data sets
and you explored how using pandas and
matplotlib you can create
different charts and analyze data
yearly data
or time series data
the sad part is that with all this
exploratory analysis and the findings
doctor similarwise made his superiors at
vena hospital refused to
accept his theory and
he was met with a lot of criticism
medical community rejected his discovery
in march 1849 and he was forced to leave
the vienna general hospital
one reason we can argue as business
analyst is that statistical analysis and
data visualization were very uncommon
those days in the field of medical
science
simulwise only published his data as
long tables of raw data but he couldn't
show any graphs or confidence intervals
to support his hypothesis
his ideas were considered as offense to
the medical community he hurt them
since similar wise meant that doctors
were the cause of increased deaths
he believed in another theory called
miasmas which basically means some bad
component in the air was the cause of
childbed fever deaths
after
two decades
when
joseph lister and luis pasture produced
more evidence of the germ theory and
antiseptic techniques only then the
value of hand washing was appreciated
but nevertheless his work was based on
evidence supported by numbers showing
that simple hand washing by healthcare
workers could save millions of lives
later he did get some recognition
the budapest university where doctor
ignace semelweis used to teach
after getting terminated from vienna
general hospital is now named as symbol
vice university
in january 2019
the statue of dr
simelweis was unveiled at the world
health organization by the current
director general mr trados you can see
on the right on the left we have the
state secretary of the ministry of
foreign affairs and trade
from hungary
on the 100th anniversary of his death
the government of austria issued a
postage stamp in his honor
and in march 2020 after the world was
hit by coronavirus
google also recognized symbol wise hand
washing findings and gave him a will
doodle
and that brings us to the end of our
interesting video tutorial on dr
simulvi's hand washing case study using
python i hope it was useful and
informative if you have any queries
