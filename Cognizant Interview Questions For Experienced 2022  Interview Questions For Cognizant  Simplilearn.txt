everyone welcome back to another video
by simply learn in this video we will be
discussing cognizant interview question
4 experience
so we'll go through different types of
interview questions that are often asked
during the interview process at
cognizant
so in this video
we will be learning about cognizant then
we'll understand cognizant recruitment
process and different interview rounds
after that we'll understand cognizant
technical interview questions for
experienced
then we'll understand the objective
interview questions and hr interview
questions for freshers and experienced
after that we'll understand how to
prepare for cognizant hr interview and
then cognizant careers
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our youtube channel and
press the bell icon to never miss an
update from simply learn
so cognizant helps business streamlight
process reimagine customer experiences
and modernize technologies to keep up
with the constant changes in business
environments
its technology offers the tools and
flexibility necessary for each person to
develop their best self
whether changing the companies that the
world relies on or helping you build
your best self
in addition to information technology
security consulting i.t and bpo
cognizant also offers services in
education and government
cognizant has three key areas of focus
digital business digital operations and
digital systems and technology so this
was about cognizant now let's understand
cognizant recruitment process
so cognizant believes in employing
people that are driven to succeed and go
above and beyond to contribute
significantly with their digital
expertise
their hiring method takes into account
the fact that students have varying
levels of ite experience
they are offered jobs depending on the
skills and interest in technology
the process for freshers happens in two
ways
that is on-campus recruitment off-campus
recruitment
the recruitment of experienced
candidates take place through job
portals like nocri
monster jobs linkedin indeed
referrals etc
so this was the recruitment process now
let's understand different interview
rounds at cognizant interview rounds are
divided into first aptitude test then
technical interview then hr interview
so first understand the aptitude test
if you are a fresher you must take the
aptitude test first
candidates can take the test on an
online platform
usually freshers apply for the jancy
position in cognizant
the gen c interview questions are
divided into the following that is
quantitative ability then logical
reasoning and english comprehension
while the experienced candidates have to
take skill based assessments
this test is based on previous
experience and technologies
now let's understand the technical
interview round
so
technical round is standard for freshest
and experienced candidates it is one of
the crucial and difficult rounds in the
entire process
the questions can vary from data
structures databases system design ui ai
ml etc now moving on to hr interview
questions
hr interview round there is not that
much to prepare hr will usually check
your attitude and organizational fitment
so that is what you need to prepare for
that round
now let's have a look at cognizant
technical integrations for experience
so our first question is
what is a linked list
so a linked list is similar to an array
it is a collection of elements in a
linear fashion
the order of the elements is determined
by the pointer
and this pointer points to the next
element in the collection
so this is what linked list is
now moving on to the next question which
is
can you reverse a linked list explain
so yes we can reverse a linked list
please follow this solution
now as you can see first of all
initialize three pointers previous as
null
current as head and next as null
now i trade through the linked list so
in a loop do the following like before
changing next of current store next node
like next equals current air operator
next
now
change next of current now this is where
the actual reversing happens
now current air operator next equals to
previous
now this is where the actual reversing
take place move the previous and current
one step forward so here what we are
doing is we are moving the previous one
step forward so we are storing the
current value to the previous and the
next value to the current
so this is how we can reverse
a linked list
now
moving on to the next question which is
what is q
provide a real life example
so it is one of the most important data
structure
the queue follows the first in first out
method
it means that the element that is
inserted first gets removed first
the elements are inserted near the
bottom and the deletion is done at the
top end
a cue for cinema tickets is a fine
example of queue
now
let's move ahead
so our next question is what is a doubly
linked list
it is an advanced version of a simple
linked list one can traverse forward and
backwards using a doubly linked list
unlike a simply linked list it stores
the previous pointer as well
now
moving to the next
question what is the difference between
push function and pop function
so push function is used to insert the
elements in the stack
while pop function is used to remove the
elements from the stack
the top is used to keep a track of
elements at the top of the stack
so this is the main difference between
push and pop function
now
moving on to the next question
explain
graph so a graph is a non-linear data
structure where elements are connected
by links
these elements are termed as vertices
and the links are called edges
and the length of the links doesn't
matter in graphs
now moving on to the next question which
is
what is the difference between stack and
array
so stack based on the leaf of principle
that is last in first out
the sequential process of accessing data
means that the last data is entered
after the first has been erased
whereas in an array there is no
particular order and each element can be
accessed by inspecting its index
now
coming to the next question which is
what is a stack
so stack is a linear data structure it
is similar to q but follows the last in
first out principle
the elements that are inserted last are
removed first
stack has two methods that is pop
function and push function
a example of stack would be a bucket of
clothes resembles as stack
now let's move on to the next question
explain the concept of a binary tree
so binary tree is a non-linear data
structure
every node in the tree has a left and
right pointers along with the data
the topmost node is known as the root
node
the nodes that have sub nodes is called
parent node and nodes that do not have
any sub nodes are known as leaf node
so binary trees are used in binary
search tree implementation
they are useful in storing records
without taking up much space
so this was the concept of binary tree
now let's move on to the next question
which is
write a program to implement search in
binary tree
so you can have a look at this example
first
so in this example we are searching node
using the condition if the root to be
searched is less than or greater than or
equal to the key value
so in first condition we are checking if
root is null or key root is present at
the root
then we are checking if root is less
than key root value
if it is then we are calling the search
function again and passing the parameter
as root dot write that is right node
else we are checking if root is greater
than key root
if yes then we are
calling the search function and passing
the parameter as root dot left that is
the left node
root so this is how you can search or
implement search in a binary search tree
now moving on to the next question
explain dynamic programming
so
dynamic programming is a technique
widely used in competitive programming
where overlapping methods are used
the main problem is divided into smaller
problems so that the result generated
from solving them can be reused again
so this is what dynamic programming is
all right
now the next question is explain
traveling salesman
what is it used for
so
the traveling salesman problem is an
algorithmic problem tasked with finding
the shortest rows between a set of
points and location that must be visited
in the problem statements the points are
the cities a sales person might visit
the salesperson goal is to keep both the
travel cost and the distance traveled as
low as possible
focused on the optimization the
traveling salesman's problem is often
used in computer science to find the
most efficient route for data to travel
between various nodes
applications include identifying network
or hardware optimization methods
so this was the traveling salesman
problem
now moving on to the next question which
is
explain the concept of merge sort
merge sort falls under divide and
conquer algorithm
the problem is broken down into smaller
problems of the same type until they are
solvable the solution to the sub problem
is then combined to provide the solution
for the initial problem
the time complexity of merge sort is
o
n into log n
all right now moving on to the next
question
can you implement bubble sort algorithm
all right so let's have a look at it
first
so the bubble sort algorithm is one of
the classic sorting algorithms the idea
is to swap the adjacent elements
if they are in wrong order
so bubble saw doesn't work well with
large data sets
so in this example we start from the
first index and compare first and second
elements
if the first element is greater than
second then we swap both of them for
swapping we are using the temp variable
that is a temporary variable
same goes for the second and third
element and this goes on until the last
element
so this is how we can do this
now moving on to the next question which
is
explain the pre-emptive multitasking
the preemptive multitasking process
allows computer programs to pool
operating systems and hardware resources
it uses established criteria to switch
resources between processes and
distributes operating and computing time
among processes
preemptive multitasking is also known as
time shared multitasking
now
our next question is
what are the steps involved in oracle
database startup
so the steps involved in oracle database
startup is
amount mount and open
you can also read about this in detail
now
our next question is
can you explain rac
so rxe stands for real application
cluster
oracle introduce is to provide high
availability and clustering for the
databases
more than two nodes of the database form
a cluster and provide 24 7 database
availability even if some nodes in the
cluster go down
so this is rac
that is real application cluster
now coming to the next question
what is split brain syndrome
so split brain syndrome happens when the
database node starts behaving like an
independent database
this can cause corruption and data loss
to prevent split brain syndrome a voting
disc is used
all right
now our next question is
what is depth first search algorithm for
binary tree
so an algorithm called dfs or depth
first search
is used to search all the nodes in a
graph or tree
the concept of traversing is to see all
the nodes at once
all right
now our next question is swap two
numbers without using the third variable
so it is a coding question or
programming question
you can have a look at this first
so in this example we are just swapping
two integers without using any temporary
variable
so we are taking two variables x and y
so say
three and five x is three and y is five
then we are taking sum of x and y and
storing it in x
making x equals eight
then we are subtracting y from x and
storing it in y
that makes y equals to three
next we are again subtracting y from x
and storing it in x making x equals to
5
now x becomes 5 and y becomes 3
so this is how we can swap two numbers
without using a third variable
all right
now our next question is
what is index
and how does it work
so index is used to optimize and improve
the performance of the database
it is a data structure used to access
and quickly locate the data in the
database
just like the index in the book database
index works in the similar way
right
coming to the next question find the
length of string without using the
string functions
so this is again a coding question
so in this example we are taking a
character array as input
then we are checking if the value inside
a character array is null or not by
using the null operator
then we are validating the same in while
loop and if it validates to be true then
we are increasing the count of length by
1.
so this is how this
question can be done
all right
next question is explain the fill factor
so the fill factor represents how much
space on each leaf level page will be
devoted to a data
so sql server's smallest unit is the
page
which is composed of 8k pages
the number of rows per page depends on
the size of the rows
the default value for fill factor is 100
which is the same as the value 0.
when the fill factor is set 200 or 0
sql server will fill the leaf level
pages of an index with as many rows as
possible
there will be no or very little blank
space on the page when the fill factor
is 100.
now
explain what is views and what
operations can be performed on views
views are virtual tables that contains
data from combination of two or more
tables
views are important when the data is
stored in different tables and you want
to have a single table
you can create update and delete a view
and these are the operations that can be
performed on views
these are the operation that can be
performed on views
now let's move on to the next topic
now let's understand cognizant objective
interview questions
so our first question is
a 300 meter long train
running at the speed of 150 kilometer
per hour crosses the second train
running in the opposite direction with
the speed of 120 kilometer per hour in
nine seconds
what is the length of the second train
option a is 370 meter option b is 400
meter option c is 375 meter and option d
is 372 meter
you can take some time to solve this
question
you can also pause this
video in order to figure out the correct
option
meanwhile we will discuss the correct
option
so the correct option is c 375 meters
so the train is running in the opposite
direction
then the total speed would be 150 plus
120 which is equal to 270 kilometer per
hour
and if we will convert it into meter per
second then it becomes 75 meter per
second
now let the length of another train be l
meter
now
300 plus l that is the length of the
other train
divided by 9 equals to 75 meter
this becomes distance upon time equals
to speed that is 300 plus l divided by 9
equals to 75
now 75 is the speed that is 75 meter per
second now by solving this equation
l that is the length comes out to be 375
meter
all right now moving on to the next
question which is
assume
a x equals to b y then
option a
log a
by log b equals to x by y
option b is log
a by b equals to x by y
option c is log a divided by log b
equals to y by x
option d is
log b divided by a equals to x y
now you can again pause this video to
figure out the correct option meanwhile
we can go ahead with the right option so
the correct option is
c
that is log a
divided by log b equals to y by x
now moving on to the next question which
is
sum of two numbers is 80 and the product
is 320 then what is the sum of the
reciprocals it is a very basic question
function a is one option b is two option
c is one by four and option d is one by
two
now you can take your time
by pausing this video
meanwhile the correct option is option d
one by four
so given a plus b equals to eighty that
is the sum of two numbers equals to 80
and a into b that is product of two
numbers is 320
then sum of their reciprocals as we know
the formula that the sum of their
reciprocals is equal to a plus b divided
by a into b that is equal to
a plus b that is the sum divided by the
product which comes out to be 80 divided
by 320 that comes out to be one by four
so one by four is the correct option
that is an option d right guys now
moving on to the next question
so our next question is how many seconds
will a 300 meter long train moving with
a speed of 83 kilometer per hour take to
cross a man walking at a speed of 3
kilometer per hour in the direction of
the train
so option a is 13.5 seconds option b is
14 seconds option c is 13 seconds or
option d 14.5 seconds
so you can pause this video again
and try to solve this question on your
own meanwhile i'll
speak the right option now
so the correct option is a 13.5 seconds
so
the train and man are moving in the same
direction
so the relative speed will be 83 minus 3
which is equal to 80 kilometer per hour
now we know that we have to convert it
into meter per seconds so we'll convert
80 km per hour into meter per second by
multiplying it with 5 by 18
which comes out to be 200 by 9 meter per
second
and we know that time equals to distance
upon speed so our distance is 300 and
our speed is 200 by 9 so we will divide
300 by 200 by 9 and our answer would be
13.5 seconds so yes the correct option
is 13.5 seconds that is option a now
moving on to the next question
so a set sum of money amounts rupees 3
000 in two years and raised 3 400 in
four years
find the sum and the rate of interest
so our option a is inr 2013
a 2000 is the sum and rate of interest
is 13
option b is twenty six hundred and seven
point seven percent
option c is fifteen hundred and twelve
point five percent and option d is
sixteen hundred and twelve percent
now i'm gonna tell the correct option
so the correct option is
option b
that is twenty six hundred and seven
point seven percent
so the interest paid in two years would
be thirty four hundred 3 000 which is
400 for two years
now so for one year we will divide 400
by 2 so it comes out to be 200
then for two years it would be 400 for
one year it would be 200
then the principal sum at the beginning
is 3 000 minus 400 that is 400 for two
years so we'll uh subtract 3000
minus 400 which comes out to be 2600 so
2600 is the principal sum at the
beginning now if we apply the formula of
rate of simple interest that is 200
divided by 2600
that is the
sum at the beginning into 100 then it
comes out to be point seven percent so
the correct option is option b twenty
six hundred and seven point seven
percent
now moving on to the next question
what is the anthem of vindictive
so you can select from these options
option aks option b for giving option c
revenge full option d
refined
so the correct option is option b that
is forgiving
now moving on to the next question
what is the antonym of peculiar
option a is normal option b is exception
option c is unique and option d is
specific
now again i'm gonna speak the correct
option so the correct option is option a
normal
now again next question what is the
antonym of prejudice
option a bias option b injustice option
c impartial option d judge
the correct option of this question is
option
c
impartial
so these are some antonym that you can
prepare or some more antennas or
synonyms that you can prepare on your
own
now
moving on to the next question
photometer is to mileage then compass is
to you have to select from distance b
direction
c speed or option d gravity
now
the correct option is option b direction
automator is to mileage then compass is
to direction
all right
now again we will move to the similar
question like that
a marathon is to raise then hibernation
is to
option a sleep option b awake option c
dream or option d animal
now the correct option is option a
that is sleep
marathon is two days then hibernation is
to sleep
are pretty easy questions
next question is window is to pane then
book is to option a page option b cover
option c author option d inc
direct option here is option a page
now the next question
cup is to coffee then bowl is to a water
b noodles c bread or d soup
correct option here is d soup
now cup is to coffee then bowl is to
soup it was pretty easy
now moving on to the next question
we cast plants six separate saplings a b
c d e f in rows number one to six
according to the following conditions he
must plant a before b and e
he must plant b and d
the third has to be c
which sitting arrangement is
acceptable now these type of questions
doesn't really need any explanation
so here are the options option a
a f c b e d this is the arrangement
option b
a b d e c f arrangement
option c
d b a c f e arrangement or option d
c e f b a d arrangement
so you have to select the correct option
among these
and now i'm gonna tell you the correct
option which is option a
that is
a f c b e d
so this is the correct option
now we can move to the next question
which is
when rahul saw aditya he recalled he is
the son of the father of my daughter
who is rahul
option a brother option b
cousin option c father-in-law or option
d brother-in-law
take your time by pausing this video
now i am going to tell the correct
option so the correct option is
option d that is brother-in-law
next question is
which of the following is synonym of
catechize
option a query option b silence option c
walk away or option d sync
the correct option of this question
would be option a query
now moving on to the next question
so which of the following is synonym of
luth
option a love option b play option c
hate or option d dance
so the correct option is option c that
is hate
now
the next question would be
which of the following is synonym of
receipt
option a attack
option b retreat
option c dodge or option d complain
now the correct option of this question
is
option b retreat
all right
now moving on to the next question
so which of the following is the synonym
of spurious
option a real option b genuine option c
fake or option d excellent
so the correct option of this question
would be option c fake
now
again a similar type of question
which of the following is synonym of
pudgy
option hrb
option b skinny option c ugly or option
d beautiful
the correct option of this question
would be
option a chubby
all right now the next question would be
if v j can be written as
x k l c a then what can
r c t k u be written as so you need to
solve this question with pen and paper
then only you can figure out the correct
option
so the options are a paris b param c
pairs
d plants
now i'm gonna tell you the correct
option
so the correct option would be option a
that is paris
now the next question would be
after walking eleven kilometers towards
south a man turns right
he walks two kilometer to the left and
seven kilometer to the right
after that he walks three kilometer
straight back
where is his starting point now
so again you have to do this
question with pen and paper
so option a is southwest option b is
south option c is northwest option d
north
correct option of this question would be
option d that is north
now coming to the next question consider
some digits between 10 and thousand such
that when each number is divided by 6 7
and 11 it leaves 5 as the remainder in
each case
what are the original numbers
option a 535 option b 400 option c 462
or option d 135
the correct option of this question
would be option c that is 462.
now moving on to the next question
in the 800 meter race
a gives b a start of 5 second and beats
him by 25 seconds
in another race a beats b by 15 seconds
the speeds are in the ratio
so the ratios are option a 10 ratio 11
option b 9 ratio 8 option c 8 ratio 9
or option d
8 ratio 8.
this one is pretty easy question and
now i'm gonna tell the correct option so
the correct option would be option
b that is nine ratio eight
now
moving on to the next question
if 1 raised to the power 3 plus 2 raised
to the power 3 plus 3 raised to the
power 3 up to so on 10 raised to power 3
equals to 4 0 5 0 then find the value of
2 raised to the power 3 plus 4 raised to
the power 3 plus 6 raised to the power 3
up to so on 20 raise to part 3
so here are our options like a 10 000 b
32 400 option c
42 350 or option d 32
000.
now
i'm gonna speak the correct option so
the correct option is 32400
so we have given that 1 raised to the
power 3 plus 2 raised to the power 3
plus 3 raised to plus 3 up to so on 10
square 3 equals to 4 0 5 0. so we have
given the value of these
now we have to find the value of 2
raised to power 3 plus 4 raised to the
power c up to so on 20 raised to power
3.
so first of all we'll take the common
so we'll take two respawn three common
out of these
so it would be like two raised power
three in the bracket there would be one
s power three plus two raised power to
three plus three raised towards we have
to so on one hundred three
ten raised power three
all right so we know that 2 raised to
the power 3 is equal to 8
now
and the rest of it we have
the value like 4 0 5 0 so we will simply
multiply 4 0 5 0 into 8 then it comes
out to be 32
400
you can try this question on your own it
is pretty easy
all right
now moving on to the next question that
what will be the most significant number
which divides 37
59 74 leaving the remainder 2 3 and 4
respectively
option a would be 7 option b would be 9
option c 10 and option d 5.
now i'm going to tell the correct option
so the right option would be option a 7
so these were some cognizant objective
interview questions
now coming to the hr questions for
freshers
so those that make it through the
technical round will advance to the
final round which is the cognizant hr
interview
candidates will have to face interaction
with cognizant's hr manager in the stage
during the hr stage candidates may also
be interviewed by a panel more than
in which there are more than one
interview
so participants will be asked things
about their personal history
academic qualifications interest
strengths weaknesses professional
experience and so on
finally if candidates are chosen in the
in this round they will now be recruited
for the job description for which they
have applied
all right now let's move on to the
questions part so the first question
which is also very common would be tell
us a bit about yourself
so this topic is typically asked to
initiate a conversation and to gain a
basic understanding of the candidate
candidates typically begin with their
current academic qualifications
technologies learned family history
projects completed in the final academic
semesters
internship programs completed and in
what role
the internships are etc
now to answer confidently to make the
best impression on the interview
the manner in which you conclude your
answer can set the tone for the next few
questions
now
let's move on to the next question
so how do you increase your knowledge so
this is
an important question
so you need to prepare for this question
so you can answer like learning does not
come to an end ever like the interviewer
will want to know if you are a critical
thinker who challenges yourself to grow
you can respond to this question by
saying that you are aware of current id
trends and that your knowledge will not
only help you advance in your career but
will also be beneficial to the company's
growth
all right
so this is how you can address this
question
now moving on to the next question
so what are your qualifications so you
must serve an example how you differ
from the other candidates
tell them about your abilities that will
help you to make a beneficial influence
at work
operating in a new environment is not
really a problem for you and
you can say a lot of similar things like
that
check that you match the job description
and explain how you believe you could be
a good fit based on your strengths
all right so this is how you can answer
this question now we can move to the
next question which is
you are employed how long do you
anticipate working for us
all right so no employer wants
an interviewee who will leave the
company after only a few years
so they anticipate that the candidates
will be a good fit for the company for
like seven to eight years
and even if you are unsure you must tell
them that as long as the job you do
challenges and leads to a profitable
company it will help you grow
so in this way you can answer these
types of questions
now the next question
why do you believe you are qualified for
this position
so now remember why you applied for this
specific rule when answering this
question tell the interviewer about your
qualifications and how
they make you eligible for this position
in addition emphasize uh how you can add
value to the current workflows
all right
now tell us about some of your strengths
this is again a very common and
important questions
so again it's
critical to research the job
requirements before attending the
interview
make a list of your areas of strength
and say the ones which
this role requires
all right now the next question would be
tell us a little about your weaknesses
all right so do not give a weak point
that will directly impact your selection
but also do not claim that you don't
even have a weakness
so the best way to respond this question
is to flip one of your strengths into a
shortcoming but you believe it is an
important to function in this way
another option for answering this
question is to provide a totally
unrelated weakness that is that will not
affect your work in the company
all right now moving on to the next
question that would be
what do you like to do in your spare
time aside from study
all right so candidates must respond to
this question by discussing their
hobbies or extracurricular activities
like just don't say that outright that
you enjoy reading books watching
television and playing sports since the
interviewer will ask you what genre you
love to read and why as well as the
technologies of the sport
so ensure you answer this question
honestly and only if you have such a
knack for doing so in your spare time
so
these were some cognizant hr interview
questions now let's understand
how to prepare for these hr interview
questions
all right
so
to prepare for these hr interview
questions you must participate regularly
before actually taking the test
make sure you have a good comprehension
of the topic and enough practice
reading good literature or registering
for a suitable online course can help
you clear your doubts now the second
point would be make sure you review your
coding test papers and practice
programming principles like c c plus
plus in java
as well as other computer essentials
like oops concept
and databases and networking
and the third point would be ensure all
the information on your cv concerning
your prior projects and internships is
correct and that you understand
everything
you will be questioned on your past
projects and work experience as well as
what technology you used and what you
have achieved so our fourth point would
be ensure that you are updated on the
technological developments
you should be familiar with the recent
technology advancements etc

trends in technology as well so these
were some tips to prepare for the
