ethereum classic is an old version or an
old member of ethereum network though it
has seen its ups and downs in the crypto
Market it still has its very own
dedicated Community which always tries
to keep it on track and that is why
ethereum classic is still among the top
cryptos in the world hey everyone I'm
shamle and I welcome you all to this new
video of Simply learn on ethereum
classing in this video I will take you
through various important Concepts and
components of ethereum classing first we
will look into the origin of ethereum
classic then we will understand what is
ethereum
classic followed by why is etherum
classic used what are the goals of
ethereum classic and after that we will
see the difference between ethereum
classic and ethereum after that we will
look at some of the limitations of the
eum classic and at the end we will
explore what is the future of ethereum
classic so without any further Ado let's
get started with the video so let's
start with the origin of etherum
classic sl. it a German business created
the Dao a decentralized autonomous
organization or da initiative on
ethereum in
2016 while the project earned over $150
million through crowdfunding hackers
took advantage of a flaw in its smart
contract and stole $50
million most ethereum users including
creators with Alec butan and Gavin W
favored a heart fork or a major
modification in the blockchain's
underlying protocol to recover the
assets resulting in the formation of the
new ethereum
chain however certain members of the
community opposed to the for preferring
to follow the principle of code is Law
and remain on the old
chain reaming it ethereum classic they
commonly referred to ethereum Classic as
the original ethereum coin since it
preserves the ancient coree of the
ethereum blockchain as it existed before
the da over assault that brings us to
the next concern which is to understand
what is ethereum
classic ethereum classic is a blockchain
based open source decentralized
distributed cryptocurrency platform that
runs smart contracts ethereum classic is
a decentralized governance platform that
leverages smart contracts embeded within
a distributed Ledger or blockchain
network it splits the original ethereum
blockchain into two parts with ethereum
classic being the older of the two and
ethereum being the newer one now let's
proceed further and have a look at the
uses of ethereum
classic etherium classic has three major
uses the ETC or etherum class classic
like other cryptocurrencies is primarily
used to pay for decentralized
computations on the ethereum network Etc
is used to pay for executing
transactions and smart contract
functions on the ethereum blockchain
this is referred to as gas and the fee
associated with these actions are known
as gas
costs Etc is also a native token with a
monetary policy that creates a
predictable disinflationary
emission scheduled with the fixed market
supply
cap now let's move ahead and have a look
at the goals of ethereum
classic the ethereum classic project has
seen several modifications and additions
since the split the Project's purpose is
to develop a global payment network
based on Smart contracts that can
operate with no centralized
Authority ethereum classic like other
cryptocurrencies will most likely
aspired to be a digital store of value
meaning you can see and exchange it
while maintaining its worth a crypto's
digital store of value includes its
purchasing power which may be swiftly
converted to cash or used to purchase
another asset just like money if getting
your learning started is half the battle
what if you could do that for free visit
skillup by simply learn click on the
link in the description to know
more now that we know all the major
components of ethereum classic let's
type down and have a look at how
ethereum classic differs from
ethereum Etc or ethereum classic is a
speculative digital asset that investors
May trade but the ethereum token or eth
is the more genuine and extensively
traded of the
two with a market capitalization of $3.9
million Etc has 116.3 million coins in
circulation while eth on the other hand
has a market capitalization of more than
34.9 billion and around 115.6 million
coins in
circulation Etc trades at $
33.65126
per coin now let's have a look at the
limitations of ethereum
classic although eum classic like
ethereum enable Smart contracts and
Target the same Market ethereum has
grown in popularity as the more
trustworthy of the two Network despite
numerous software upgrades the
scalability of ethereum Classics payment
mechanism remains one of the Project's
largest concern in the future
furthermore security is likely to be an
issue with smart contracts especially
because ethereum classic has already
been hacked and millions of dollars
stolen so this brings brings us to the
very important question that is what
future ethereum classic holds for
itself because ethereum is considered
the more authentic of the two networks
ethereum Classic's future appears to be
less bright than ethereum specially
given ethereum classic security concerns
itum classic may have difficulties until
it can modify its code and software to
prevent future
hacks well this was all about ethereum
classing so what are your thoughts on
ethereum classing and will you be
investing money in it we have almost
reached the end of this video if I
missed anything important do let me know
