now let's get started with our one point
agenda that is excel worksheet
now let's get back to the practical mode
now we are on our excel sheet
now what are we going to do in this
particular sheet so basically we can
have multiple operations on excel
worksheet
to do so you just have to navigate to
the excel sheet over here
and just right click on it and you'll
get to know
many options that are provided to work
with on excel sheets you can either
insert a new sheet or delete an existing
sheet or rename an existing sheet and in
case if you wanted to move or copy your
existing sheet you can also do that and
if you want to view some particular
codes you can do that and in case if
your data is highly sensitive then you
can also secure it and there is also an
option of
changing the tab color or hiding your
sheet and selecting all sheets in your
workbook
don't worry we shall go through all the
fundamentals one after the other at
first we will select to insert a new
sheet now let's click on the insert
button to insert a new sheet
now when you click that particular icon
you'll have various set of options
inside that you will have worksheet
chart ms excel 4.0 macro etc but right
now we are in need of a new worksheet so
i'll select the worksheet and just press
ok to get a new sheet and you can see
we have a new sheet in front of the
sheet 1 which was the previously
existing sheet
now let's go through another option
which is to delete an existing sheet
you can do that just by
selecting the delete icon and there you
go you can see that our newly created
sheet just got deleted
now the next option let's try to rename
this particular sheet
okay so you just have to right click and
select a rename option and there you go
here you can see that our sheet one has
been highlighted and now we are capable
to do the operation of renaming this
particular sheet
let's rename this sheet as excel sheet
1.
now you can also click this particular
plus icon to create a new sheet and you
will have a new sheet and instead of
right clicking and going to the rename
option you have another shortcut where
you can just double click on the sheet
name and the sheet name can be
renamed
so now let's rename this as
excel
sheet
that's how you do it
now let's create a couple of more sheets
a
there you go we have five excel sheets
now let's see what can be done
so now if we want to move the excel
sheet 1 to a new workbook then we can do
that
just select the sheet select the move or
copy icon and there you go you have
various set of options here
now it is asking for a book we already
have a book one
or if you wanted to
move this particular sheet inside this
particular workbook or copy the sheet
inside this workbook and paste it in the
same workbook then you have to choose
the option of book one or in case if you
wanted to create a new book then you
have to select the new book option
and then
if you don't want this sheet to be
cut or eliminated from this workbook
then you can select the create a copy
option which will save your copy from
the existing worksheet and it will only
send a copy of your version but not it
will not cut the worksheet
so that's the
option provided by excel now let's click
ok and you can see that we have a new
workbook over here named as book2 and
the sheet
excel sheet1 from the workbook one has
been copied to workbook two that's how
you copy an existing worksheet into a
new workbook so now let's get back to
the older workbook that is book one
now let's try to copy the existing
worksheet into the same existing
workbook for that let's select the
worksheet and right click on it and now
you can see the move or copy option so
we have chosen the same book one over
here
now
let's create a copy
and select okay
and there you go you can see that we
have a duplicate copy of excel worksheet
one
in the bracket 2.
now let's delete this
or let's keep it we will try to perform
a move operation now
now let's choose the book as 2
and
now we are not going to select the
create a copy option so now the entire
sheet will be cut and pasted into the
workbook too let's press ok
and there you go the sheet got
eliminated and it got pasted in this
particular book too
so that's how you move it
and now let's look on to the other
operations
let's now try to change the tag color
now we have five different excel sheets
so let's select five different colors
for each one of them
let's select
black for this
and for this
let's select
blue
and for this
let's select orange and that is
green
and this one would be
perfect
yeah
so there we go we have five different
colors for all the five different sheets
now
let's try to hide sheet one
so there you go the sheet one has got
hidden
and let's try to hide the sheet for
sheet three as well so the sheet number
three got hidden and if you want to
unhide them just right click and select
unhide and there you go you have a
dialog box which shows you the hidden
sheets for now let's try to unhide sheet
number one
now we got our sheet number one back
and again the sheet three we got our
sheet three also back
now let's select all the sheets together
for that
let's hold ctrl shift
or
let's hold ctrl and select all the
sheets
yeah
there you go
we have now selected all the sheets
now let us imagine that we are going to
store similar type of data in all the
sheets for example let us consider in
the sheet number one we are going to
store the details of students of class
one similarly in sheet two we'll store
the details of class two and three and
so on
now for that you might have similar
columns right so instead of uh
individually
naming all the sheets you can do this
trick where you can just
collect or group all the sheets together
and write the same data in all of them
at once
now i have selected all the sheets
let's type in the names roll number
now the next one is name
then
percentage
and
[Music]
it can be written address
phone number
yeah that should be good
yeah
now we have collected all the sheets
together and we have edited the data in
one sheet and magically all the sheets
have the same data
okay there has been a small error we
have chosen
the last part of the sheet that was xdn
so it was the last or final columns now
let's try to do that again
now
let's select
the sheet
one to five and now we're in the first
column let's try to do that again
then
the name
percentage
and
address
and phone
so you can see that we have the
name called as group which resembles
that these sheets of 1 to 5 are a group
now
so we have given our column names
so we have written the column names role
number name percentage address and phone
and one sheets and magically it's been
added to all the sheets now we will
navigate to all the sheets so the first
sheet
then the second sheet then we have the
third sheet fourth and fifth so all the
sheets have got the same data which we
try to enter in one single sheet
now the next step is to try to protect
your sheet
so uh
how to know the difference now let's try
to edit this right so you can edit this
roll number to
roll number right
now
what if i protect the sheet like
sometimes the information might be
sensitive right and we don't want anyone
to be messing up with your data so in
that situation you can always protect
your sheet so for that you just have to
right click and there is always an
option called protect the sheet
select that and you have this and you
can see uh select load cells and select
unlocked cells so basically all the
cells in excel are by default locked
and
yeah basically by selecting all the
cells over here we are not supposed to
edit any one of those without be
selecting select lock cells and select
unlock cells and press ok
and now your sheet is completely
protected
how
let's try
now let's try to edit this and there you
go excel throws an error which says the
cell or chart you're trying to change is
own a protected sheet
so if you want to unprotect this you can
always do that
just go to the sheet and unprotect it
and now you're again free to edit it
right now let's rename this
and there you go it's done
so that's how you do it so with that we
have come to an end of this tutorial on
excel worksheet and if you have any
