and Google Cloud platform you will
Master the architectural principles
Services of the top Cloud platform
design deploy highly scalable fall
tolerant application and develop skills
to transform your career in this domain
now before we move on and begin with our
road map tutorial let us discuss our
agenda for today's session so we are
going to start our session with an
introduction to what is a data engineer
moving ahead we are going to learn about
what does a Azure data engineer do then
we will learn about why to choose this
field and at the end we are going to
conclude our session with a discussion
on road map to become a data engineer so
guys let's start with what is a data
engineer so guys a data engineer is a
professional who specializes in
designing implementing and managing Data
Solutions in this case they will be
using Microsoft Azure cloud services
basically they are responsible for
building scalable and reliable data
pipelines data warehouses and analytic
Solution on the Azure I hope so you
would have got a brief idea regarding
what is a data engineer now you would be
wondering what does a Azure data
engineer do so guys the key
responsibility of an Azure data engineer
includes first one is architecting Data
Solutions it means that you are going to
design data architectures and solution
using Azure services
such as Azure sinapse analytics Azure
data Factory Azure data bricks Azure SQL
database Azure Cosmos DB and others next
one is building data pipelines you're
going to develop data pipelines to
ingest processes and transform data from
various sources into Azure data stores
data warehouses or data Leakes third one
we have all over here is data
transformation and ETL you're also going
to perform data transformation
like cleansing enrichment using Azure
services like Azure data Factory Azure
data breaks or Azure function next one
we have all over here is monitoring and
optimization you're going to monitor the
performance availability and the cost of
azure data solution and optimizing them
for scalability efficiency and cost
Effectiveness these are some of the key
responsibilities what Azure data
engineer can do now guys let us move on
and discuss
that why should you choose this field
guys working as an Azure data engineer
can be both challenging and fulfilling
as a data engineer you will play a
crucial role in helping companies
succeed by providing Data Solutions
you'll also be collaborating with data
scientists analysts and decision makers
with the information they need to
perform their tasks effectively you'll
utilize your programming skills and
analytical abilities to create scalable
Solutions now here are some of the key
reasons why I should recommend you to
become a data engineer the first one is
in today's scenario there is a
increasing Demand with increasing
adoption of cloud computing and data
analytics there is a high demand for
professionals who can design Implement
and manage Data Solutions on Azure next
one we have all over here is Microsoft
Azure market dominance this is also one
of the reason why you should join as
Azure data engineer guys Azure is one of
the leading cloud platforms globally
which offers a vast ecosystem of
services and tools for data engineering
is specializing as an Azure data
engineer provides access to a dominant
player in the market now third one we
have is there is continuous learning you
will have an effective learning curve
throughout your career span next one we
have all over here is data services now
if I talk about comprehensive data
services Azure offers a comprehensive
suit of data services including storage
integration warehousing analytics
machine learning which empowers data
Engineers to build end to-end Solutions
tailored to diverse business needs fifth
one we have all over here is scalability
and flexibility we all know that aures
scalability and flexibility enables data
Engineers design highly scalable and
elastic solutions that can adapt to
changing business requirements and data
volumes sixth one we have all over here
is integration with Microsoft ecosystem
Azure seamlessly integrates with
Microsoft suit of products and services
allowing organizations to leverage
existing infrastructure and Technologies
effectively next one we have all over
here is robust security and compliance
aure provides robust security features
and compliance certifications making it
suitable for handling sensitive and
regulated data with confidence next one
we have all over here is lucrative
salaries toer off friends that asure
data Engineers command competitive
salaries with average annual earnings
ranging from $100,000 to
$150,000 in the US higher salaries are
often attainable with experience
certifications and expertise in Azure
Data Solutions so guys becoming an Azure
data engineer offers not only the
opportunity to work with the cutting ede
technology but also to contribute to
organizational success but also the
potential for significant financial
rewards and care advancement so that's
why you should join this field now let's
move on and discuss the most crucial
part of this video that is road map to
become a data engineer so guys here is a
road map for becoming a data engineer
the first step is building the
foundation now guys what you're going to
do you're going to learn the programming
languages start with python SQL and then
learn Powershell for Azure automation
familiarize yourself with the Bas basics
of Microsoft Azure including its
services architectures and deployment
models and finally study data structures
and algorithms understand the
fundamental data structures and
algorithm as they form the backbone of
inefficient data processing next step is
learning about Azure data services so
guys all you have to do is dive into the
Azure data services such as Azure
synapse analytics Azure data Factory
Azure data bricks SQL database Azure
Cosmos and others next one we have all
over here is that you have to learn
about the database systems learn about
both relational databases like Azure SQL
database and also no SQL databases for
example Azure Cosmos DB third one learn
about data Weare housing understand data
housing Concepts and how to build data
we housing using Azure synapse analytics
fourth one we have all over here is
getting expertise in Big Data technology
such as aure SG Insight aure data bricks
for processing and analyzing large
volumes of data and finally we have all
over here is learning about the Big Data
Technologies I hope so you would have
got idea regarding the step two now
let's delve into the step three third
step is developing data engineering
skills now what are these skills first
one is you have to learn how to build
data pipelines using Azure data Factory
so that you can extract transform and
load data from various sources next one
in this process you will also have to
learn about data integration you have to
understand how to integrate data from an
on premisis system like SAS application
and external sources into Azure Data
Solutions next one we have all over here
is data transformation and ETL use Azure
data brakes Azure data Factory or Azure
functions to perform data transformation
cleansing and enrichment and finally we
have all over here is learning about
data modeling this is the most crucial
part in enriching your skills as a data
engineer you will learn about data
modeling techniques and schema design
for optimizing data storage and
retrieval in Azure data services so I
hope so guys you would have got a brief
idea regarding step three next step is
gain expertise in data analytics and
visualization learn about analytics
Services explore servic
such as Azure syapse analytics Azure
analysis service for performing Advanced
analytics and building data
visualizations next is Master tools like
powerbi for creating interactive
dashboards and report to visualize
insights derived from Azure Data
Solutions this is step four and the
final step is getting certified guys
attain Microsoft certification consider
pursuing certifications like Microsoft
certified aure data engineer associate
which validates your expertise in
designing and implementing Data
Solutions on Azar and this way the road
map gets completed and after this apply
for jobs internship on LinkedIn and
other job portals and definitely you'll
be able to become a data engineer so
