another informative video from Simply
learn imagine you're managing an online
store you need to handle day-to-day
transactions and live sales Trends over
the past year and store massive amounts
of raw customer feedback from social
media how do you manage all this data
efficiently this is where databases data
warehouses and data Lakes come into play
I'm pretty sure most of you are well
aware of what a database is a database
is a system that stores and organizes
data in a structured way using rows and
columns making it easy to access manage
and update information now if data can
be stored and managed in datab bases
then what is a data warehouse and a data
Lake and why do we need them so in this
video I will give you a clear
understanding of what a database data
warehouse and data leak is with examples
how are they different from each other
and what factors to consider before
choosing among the three so let's jump

comprehensive goals let's build your
Cloud expertise together so let's get
started so what is a data base a
database is essentially a structured
collection of data or information that
is stored electronically it serves as a
centralized repository where data is
organized in a systematic way often
using tables rows and columns so the
primary function of a database is to
support online transaction processing or
oltp which means it handles the realtime
transactions and operations of
businesses or applications so behind the
scenes a database management system or
dbms manages the database
ensuring data is stored securely and
efficiently so the dbms also allows
users and applications to interact with
the data through queries updates and
modifications so in common usage the
term database can refer both to the
actual data repository and the software
system or dbms that manages it providing
a seamless interface between users and
their stored information now there are
two types of databases relational
databases store data in structured
tables with fixed rows and columns this
structured approach makes them ideal for
applications requiring strong data
consistency and complex quidding
capabilities on the other hand
non-relational databases often refer to
as nosql databases offer more
flexibility by accommodating various
data models so these include Json for
semi-structure data Bon key value pairs
for simple data retrieval tables with
Dynamic columns for evolving schemas and
graph databases using nodes and edges
for connected data Rel relationships so
some of the examples of databases are
Oracle MySQL and postra SQL and also
mongodb now what is a data warehouse so
a data warehouse functions as a
specialized database designed to store
structured information gathered from
multiple sources so encompassing both
current and historical data so unlike
traditional databases primarily focused
on transaction processing data
warehouses are tailored for analytical
purposes so they consolidate data from
different systems to facilitate
comprehensive analysis uncover insights
and generate business intelligence
through reports and dashboards so in
essence while a data warehouse is indeed
a type of data base it distinguishes
itself by its optimized architecture for
handling complex queries and
facilitating data analytics essential
for strategic decision making in
organizations so a data warehouse serves
as a centralized repository designed to
store large volumes of both current and
historical data gathered from diverse
sources this data ranges from raw
initially ingested information to highly
refined cleansed filtered and aggregated
data sets the process of moving data
into a data warehouse is managed through
extract transform load or ETL process
which extract data from its original
sources transform it to fit the
warehouse schema and load it into the
warehouse on a regular basis such as
early or daily schedules so this
periodic loading means that the data
warehouse may not always reflect the
most current state of the original
systems so once the data is successfully
loaded into the warehouse business
analysts and data scientists can utilize
business intelligence tools to connect
to the data warehouse so these tools
enable them to explore the data uncover
valuable insights and generate reports
that Aid business stakeholders in making
informed decisions based on
comprehensive data
analysis so examples of data warehouse
is Amazon red shift Google big query and
IBM db2 warehouse now one is a data
Leake so a data Leake serves as a
centralized storage repository for data
collected from various sources
preserving it in its original or raw
format so unlike data warehouses that
also handle extensive volumes of both
current and historical data data LS
distinguish themselves by the
versatility in storing diverse data
formats such as Json Bon CSV Etc so the
core objective of a data L typically
revolves around analyzing this data to
extract valuable insight ites so however
some organizations use data leaks mainly
because they offer Affordable storage
options storing data and anticipation of
future analysis so data legs are
versatile storage systems that can
handle large amounts of structured
semi-structured and unstructured data so
unlike traditional databases or data
warehouses data laks don't need data to
be organized before storing it allowing
quick accumulation of diverse data types
like spreadsheets Json files PDFs and
multimedia so different users Access
Data differently structured data is
often used directly by business analysts
for insights while unstructured data
requires expertise from developers data
scientists or data Engineers this set of
flexibility lets analysts and scientists
discover unexpected patterns and
insights using the data's variety and
volume to solve problems that weren't
anticipated initially so data and data
legs can be processed with online
analytical processing or oap systems and
visualize using business intelligence
tools improving data exploration and
decision- making capabilities some of
the examples of data Lake are AWS S3
Azure data Lake storage Gen 2 Google
cloud storage Etc so now let's recap the
differences among the three of them so
if your application needs to store data
which is essential for most interactive
apps having a database is crucial so
databases are fundamental for
applications in various Industries and
scenarios they provide an organized way
to store retrieve and manage data
effectively for instance an online store
uses a database to handle product stocks
and customer orders similarly a
Healthcare System relies on databases to
manage patient information and medical
histories even social media apps use
databases to store user profiles and
posts so without databases it would be
difficult to manage and access data
reliably impacting the functionality and
usability of interactive applications
now data warehouses are essential when
organizations need to store large
amounts of historical data and analyze
it deeply to gain business insights
their organized structure makes data
analysis straightforward accessible to
business analysts and beneficial for
data scientists so unlike transactional
databases used daily for operations data
warehouses specialize in handling
complex queries and generating detailed
reports so this capability supports
strategic decision making based on past
Trends and patterns it's important to
know that while data warehouse is
excellent analytics they are in suitable
for real-time transaction processing or
handling multiple uses at once so
organizations typically maintain
separate databases for day-to-day
operations and use the data warehouse
specifically for strategic analytics and
business intelligence now data Lakes are
a budget friendly way to store large
amounts of data in its original form so
unlike regular databases or data
warehouses that need data to be
organized beforehand data leaks allow
storing various data types like
structured semi-structured and
unstructured without immediate
restructuring so this keeps data Raw
letting business fully explore and
analyze both current and past
information uncovering insights that may
not be obvious initially so data LS are
great for advanced analytics such as
machine learning and predicting Trends
offering flexibility for experimenting
with data however they aren't suitable
for handling day-to-day transactions or
meeting the fast data access needs of
operational tasks which traditional
databases and data warehouses specialize
in so I hope now you all know how the
three of them differ now having known
that there are some factors to be
considered before deciding on which
platform to use so let's look into those
considerations like the variety and
volume of data sources the way data
arrives and how predictable its structur
is are crucial so data leaks are
versatile handling unstructured data in
various formats on the other hand data
warehouses specialize in structured data
from multiple sources now databases
perform well with structured data from
one source but may struggle with
scalability now the choice between these
platforms depends on these factors
shaping the rules in data management and
analytics now in a solid data management
strategy choosing when and how to use
data models is crucial in a solid data
management strategy choosing when and
how to use data models is crucial data
laks offer flexibility by storing raw
data alongside metadata allowing schemas
to be applied later during data
extraction for analysis on the other
hand databases and data warehouses use
ETL extract transform load
processes here raw data is transformed
into a predefined structure of an
ingestion called schema on right this
difference shows how data Lakes enable
agility in exploring data and adjusting
schemas as needed contrasting with
databases and data warehouses that
prioritize upfront data organization and
consistency through fixed schemas now
big data is highly valuable for
businesses evident in their investments
in data management as data grows in
volume and speed storage expenses
increase data leaks are cost effective
because they store data as is reducing
storage needs compared to data
warehouses that require extensive
processing before analysis databases can
scale storage capacity to match demand
now the choice between a data warehouse
data lake or relational database depends
on users's role whether they are a
business analyst data scientist or a
part of operations and the specific
organizational needs so operations teams
focused on business insights often
prefer data warehouses for structured
data analytics despite higher setup and
storage costs data scientists prer data
legs for their flexibility with
structured and unstructured data which
supports Advanced Ai and machine
learning business analysts skilled in
SQL may find relational databases
adequate for generating specific Trend
reports on business segments so each
option serves different needs based on
data complexity analytics requirements
and cost considerations now
organizations have different preferences
between open source and proprietory
software along with the communities
backing them so data Leakes are popular
because many use platforms like Hadoop
and there's a growing amount of
unstructured data from various company
systems and real-time data streams
another important point is how easy and
affordable it is to update systems and
when data sources and structures change
unlike relational databases and data
warehouses which can be expensive to
update data legs make it simple to
adjust making them flexible for changing
data needs so there you have it hope you
