back plus with tricks up its sleeves
like integrating with PowerPoint
designer or a PRM it turns the daunting
task of presentation making into
something you might actually enjoy and
before we move on guys just a quick info

learning from the experts then try
giving a short to Simply learns
postgraduate program in a ml in
collaboration with bird University and

program you will gain expertise in
skills like generative AI prom
engineering chat jpt explainable AI
machine learning algorithms supervised
and unsupervised learning model training
and optimization and there much more on
the list so what are you waiting for
hurry up and enroll now you can find the
course Link in the pin comment and
description box below so let's get
started okay guys let's start with
creating the Google Slides or PowerPoint
presentation with the help of chat gity
and we'll do this in two ways starting
one with the VBA code so here we'll ask
the chat gbt to to write a VBA code for
the PowerPoint presentation and for that
we'll write a
prompt that is uh write a VBA code for
PowerPoint presentation and you would
just write the topic that is on how to
become a generative a expert and you
would mention some of the details like
you want a road map in the PowerPoint
presentation or just the steps to become
a generative AI expert so let's see an
example so ask the chat that wrer
VBA
code
for PowerPoint
presentation and we'll write the
topic on how to become a generative
AI or a master in generative
Ai and here you could mention the
details also or you could ask the chat
GT that you can act as an expert in
computer science or as an expert in
artificial intelligence and you could
create a PowerPoint presentation and
give us a VBA code on how to become a
master in
generative and you could ask him that I
own the slides in a manner or you could
just list the slides that on slide one I
want the problem faced by generi experts
then in the next slide I want what
skills and on the next slide that is
slide two I want to know what skill
skills that generative AI expert should
process and in slide three I want the
road map and in the upcoming slides I
want all the road map skills or the
roles to be explained in a good manner
that I can understand or I can use this
PP for like for students to get them
understand so you could like modify your
prompt
accordingly so let's see uh how the chat
GPD respond to this and what VB code it
will provide to
us so you could see that chbt has
started jointing the response and you
could see here that to use this VBA code
you'll need to access the VB editor in
PowerPoint and for that you just need to
press alt plus f11 and then insert a new
module I'll show you how you could
insert the VBA code in
PowerPoint uh till then he in
like generating the response will come
back here so this is the developer
option that we need to
unlock so just click on the blank
presentation and coming on the blank
presentation just right click here and
you could see the option customize the
ribbon so this is the ribbon the whole
thing this whole thing this is the
ribbon and you could see the options
here and this is the developer option
which I have already tick marked that is
it is accessible in my ribbon Hub so we
make it accessible and here in the
developer option you have to click on
Visual Basic and then insert user form
then we have module here click on the
module and here we have to paste the VBA
code that will be provided by the ch gbt
as you could see that it has provided
the code and there's another method that
is you just press all plus f11 and then
you will come on the particular slide
here then you have to go here and use
the module and paste it here so we will
copy the VBA
code get back here paste the code and
this is the button you have to click
that is run sub or user form just click
cck on it and you could see that it has
provided the PowerPoint presentation so
it is the basic presentation as I have
not like commanded the chat jpt or I
have not modified my prompt accordingly
I've have just used the basic prompt
that just generate a basic presentation
on how to become an expert in generative
VI so you could modify a prompt
accordingly on how you want to
presentation and put the design thing
you could use any template or
layout so we have the design here so you
could use any
design what you
prefer so you would see that it has
applied the design to all the
presentations you could ask the chat
GPT if you want to like have more text
heavy and if you want to generate images
also you could do that with the help of
D so now moving to the next method on
how we we can create PPS or the
PowerPoint using chat gipt this is the
one method that is using the VBA code
now moving back to chat
gbt now here we'll ask
him
that generate a PowerPoint pitch deack
for a topic and that could be any topic
you want so here we will modify our
prompt and ask him that act as a
as an expert in
CS that would be computer
science and I want him to
generate PowerPoint
presentation that would be pitch
Tech and that would be for
topic let's move to the topic for the
cloud computing
topic on
mastering cloud
computing okay and we will instruct him
that structure the
presentation in the following
manner
in the following sections and now we can
provide him the section that
is
problems faced by Cloud
expert then it could be
skills and then the road
map
roles
salary I think that's it and you can
modify accordingly what you want in your
presentation let's see what it will
provide to
us so you would see that it has started
generating
it
so what we'll do here is we'll open the
word
here
and we'll paste all the content that has
been provided by the chat jpd and using
the word
only what we'll use here we'll
paste
and we'll use the paste formatting here
that is the merge formatting so first
delete all
these
okay now we have the content
here and we don't want this also now m
to the view
outline and here what we'll
do we will make these like the the
titles just get back and use control Ed
we'll find all the slide
titles and replace them with a
space okay and there
are colons also so we have made The
Replacements here now for the content
part also we have to make that
replacement so we'll use the control h
only and what we have here is
content and we'll replace
it with like nothing that would be empty
only and
subtitle so yeah our Word document is
here now moving to the view outline and
here what we'll do we'll make all this
that is the heading of the
slides we'll select all of
them and make them as level
one and all
the other
things as level two if you see the
content it has not provided us the good
content that it has just provided what
things we can include in the PowerPoint
not like the chat has not given us the
all the content that should be included
in the powerpint like you could see here
that is in the first slide it has stated
that mastering cloud computing a
comprehensive guide and unlocking the
future of technology only it has not
Prov us the content and in this what is
cloud computing it has said that Define
cloud computing and its importance in
the modern digital landscape
it has not defined for us it has just
provided the definitions so you have to
modify prompt that I want the whole PP
presentation with all the information or
all
the understandings of the
concepts so you could do
that and
now in the view section
only with this we'll save
this and we'll save this on the desktop
only and name it as
PP okay now mve to the
PowerPoint and here we'll move to file
blank
presentation and in the new slide we
will click on the option slides from
outline move to the desktop here we have
the ppf file we will insert
itose is used by another user
okay so we'll close
this and click on
okay will do the process again that
insert it and wait for some time till
then it proceeds with that and create
the presentation so you could see here
that it has created the presentation
here that is mastering cloud computing a
comprehensive guide and looking the
future of technology so you could see
that CH GT has not provided us all the
information it has just drafted how you
could insert information in the slides
so what you can do is you could just go
to chat jbt and ask him that provide all
the informations for the slide one and
then paste it in your word document
accordingly you could do for all the
slides and then save the word document
after doing the level one and level two
headings for the content and after that
you could just come here and in the new
slide section just click on slides from
outline and insert the document that's
it and if you want to design it you
could use any layout or template so with
