Microsoft powerbi certification training
now without further delay let's get
started now what exactly is data
modeling so most of the times your data
might be from different sources let's
say one of your team member prefers to
use Microsoft Excel and another one
prefers to use a relation database and
sometimes you might have to take care
about the realtime streaming data from
your company's websites like maybe the
traffic for today current traffic
current number of leads current number
of applications submitted Revenue cost
Bel Etc right so this data comes from
different s sources and you being a data
analyst should be able to segregate all
the data collect all the data filter it
and create one single module to perform
your analysis right so the process of
collecting data from different sources
segregating it and trying to relate them
to one another is process called as data
modeling in PBI now data modeling is
done with the help of power pivot is
also available in Microsoft Excel maybe
since it at least more than decade right
so the same powerp is also used in power
pii now to understand more on that let's
go ahead before we get into Power pivot
and understand all the technicalities
let's understand some theoretical
answers now modeling can be done in two
ways first one is the dimensional
modeling which is currently used in most
of the business intelligence tools and
another one is the relationship model
which we have seen since ages where we
use an normal relational database where
we create some foreign Keys some primary
keys and try to relate one table to
another based on the foreign key and
primary now let's go ahead with the
dimensional module first so what exactly
is a dimensional table you ask so
dimensional table is one of the set of
companion tables to a fact table so
let's say the center table which you
have here sales is the fact table so
sales data will basically have the
product ID order ID profit gained price
of the product quantity Etc right so
this particular table which is in the
central place which is called as a fact
table is connected to the store which
will have the details of the store
region location and another table which
has details about product another table
which has the details about dates
shipment date order date delivery date
and another table customer so all these
dimensional tables are connected to the
fact table right so customer so the fat
table is something which will not change
over time let's say on today's date on
current date you made a sale of $100 you
sold five to six products right it will
be the same even after you open the
database after an a it is not going to
change it is a fact it is a real data
right and when it comes to product there
might be changes in product ID there
might be changes in you know minor
changes not if not 100% change they
might be negligible changes they might
be negligible update something like that
maybe you are collecting customer first
name second name phone number and
address maybe tomorrow you might also
want to have an email ID added to it
maybe tomor you want to add some
specific you know customer IDs or custom
something you know some additional
things to your DL so that's the
difference between the regular table and
the fact table so this is how the
dimensional modeling is done when it
comes to the next type of modeling that
is the relationship model right so you
will be having one table and you will
try to connect to a different table
right both these tables are connected
based on a primary key and a foreign key
so the primary key in product table can
be the product ID right and when you go
into the next table which is product
type there you will be having maybe
category subcategory product name and
the category or the subcategory can act
as a primary key for product typ table
additionally there will be another
column on the name of product ID which
will become the foreign key for product
table and a primary key for product
table and you can connect product table
and product type table together using
these primary key and foreign key so the
SQL the people who know SQL might have a
better IDE on this in case if you don't
have IDE on that we have a dedicated set
of tutorials in SQL and data loading so
you can have a look at that in the same
powerbi series now that we have a
detailed understanding of the types of
modeling in pobi or data modeling let's
proceed with the relationships right
cardinality or the types of
relationships which you can establish
using the previous model which we
discussed which as this one dimension
model right so the cardinality or the
types of relationship what you can
expect is one to many many to many one
to one and many to one let's say we will
deal with the same sales data and
customer data right so in customer data
let's say we have 10 customers and in
the sales data we have the same 10
customers but 100 entries right so
customer number number one maybe let's
say Harry Potter Harry Potter is your
customer and Harry Potter bought 10 WS
today and after a couple of weeks he
came back again and he bought 10 more
ones right so there is a multiple entry
here so many entries are related to one
entry which is in customer table right
such relationship is called as many one
to many and when it comes to many to
many then you might have another table
sales table and the product table right
where you have the product the wants
right so wants to customers that is many
to many and there is a specific wand
let's say Elder Wand and the user you
guessed it right it can be the last one
who holded the one so one to one that
kind of a relationship is one to one so
remember we are using some movie analogy
so that it is easier for you to
understand and the last time one is
let's consider it add a slight
assessments to you so you tell me in the
comment section about what could be many
to one so these are the types of data
modeling and cardinalities which you can
perform while data modeling now we will
understand this in a much better way
using a practical demonstration before
we move ahead using this directly on
powerbi let's understand Pap pivot how
exactly it works in Excel then you can
understand how it functions in power Pi
remember so power pivot power query one
and the same for both powerbi and
Microsoft Excel so powerbi is an
advanced version of Microsoft Excel
which has you can consider this way okay
which has some additional
functionalities of creating some vibrant
charts and ability to get connected to a
bigger higher Advanced versions of data
storage like Cloud Etc right so that's
how you can simplify the difference
between a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet
and the Microsoft PBI product or the
business intelligence tool okay pretty
much so far so good now let's quickly
switch to Microsoft Excel so this is my
local storage and here we have some
Excel files so remember Microsoft Excel
or Microsoft power query or Microsoft
powerbi can load data from an Excel
worksheet a a separated file the same
Excel file which is saved in form of CSV
it can take data from a PDF it can take
data from a website it can take data
from cloud so we have also covered an
exclusive tutorial on how to load data
onto a powerbi from various sources the
link can be found in the description box
below or let us know and we will have it
sent to you so we have the same tutorial
in our PBI Series right so here we are
dealing with with the Microsoft Excel
files so as discussed before in the
dimensional model we have the fact table
which is the sales data and other all
the dependent measures of data where we
have customers di you know store
locations product data region sales Etc
so we will also have this uh data set or
the file Linked In the description box
below should you want to follow us in
this demo you can download the data and
follow us in the explanation process now
let's go ahead let me open sales data
and let me also open another data set
which will have customers data maybe
let's try to open a few more files so
this is the customers data and here we
have um sales here we have a
product could be store locations
so we have opened uh store location
sales team product data customers data
sales data and lastly the regions data
right so we have about six files in it
so we can you know load all these six
files onto power VI and you know so here
we have already created a data model
over here so before we directly jump
onto this we will understand how exactly
the query and power pivot Works in Excel
so that you can apply the same knowledge
on powerbi for a better understanding
right now let's close this we don't have
anything to do with this right now let's
understand deal with Microsoft ex right
so we have the sales data right over
here and uh the next let's say we go
with right so here we have a different
region South West North right so we
don't have the region data in sales
table but what we have is sales channels
and uh audit dates shipment dates Etc
customer ID correct now let's say I have
a query I want to find out uh how many
number of sales happened through this
particular sales channel in all the
regions let's say I have east west north
south and I wanted to find out how many
number of wholesale sales happened in
east region how many number of in store
sales happened in west region right so
when you want to uh you know do this you
might want to run some formulas or run
some tools like building a privot table
or maybe a vooka function which is a
little complicated to understand right
you might have to create an entirely new
table you might want to pull pull the
data from both the tables using the
lookup key the range the exact match
right the number column number and the
exact match or you know approximate
match it's a hectic time ask right but
when you know how a power pivot or a
pivot table power query works then it's
just like a Bree so let's quickly uh
maybe create a new workbook and here we
have Papa pivot option should you have a
doubt how to activate Papa pivot it's
really simple so you just need to go to
the file option over here just click on
file and go to options
enter and here you have an option called
addin click on addin and here just go to
excel addin com so you you need to
select the second one com addin and go I
have already included the option so I
have it over here in case if it's not
added just click on Microsoft power
pivot for Excel and just okay you will
find it in the riin right next to it
right so here you have it now before we
just directly dive into P pivot let's go
to home and try to load data so go to
data and get data from file so we are
working on Excel workbook so we'll take
Excel so we wanted to find out the
region wise sales correct so go to
downloads and here we have data modeling
inbi data sets and expand this a little
go to sales data and import now the
power query will be firing in the
background and it will show you the
various uh tables it just had a look at
and select the table you want and now
instead of directly loading it go to the
option called load to now it will give
you a new option where you don't have to
import the entire table but just create
a connection only and add this to the
data model check on that correct so
these are the two steps only create
connection and add this data to the data
model press okay and so far so good the
sales data is getting loaded now let's
try to do that step once again and now
we will import a different table which
is Regions data import and there you go
select state regions load to and the new
box or new window where you will be
selecting only create a connection and
add this data to the data model okay now
the magic starts go go to the power
pivot and select manage and here you
have some tables sales table and state
regions correct now you are not using
any V lookup X lookup hookup functions
you're not using any pivot tables you
are just clicking on the option called
pivot table that's all and a new pivot
table will be created right now you have
sales and regions select uh maybe the
region and go to to the first table
where we had sales and maybe you can
count the order numbers that will also
help you or you can unit price unit so
I'll go with the number of sale we
initially we wanted to find the number
of sales right so you can just uh add
the order number okay remove this from
here from the row we don't want and
count so it has automatically taken the
count over here so you have the count so
you totally have
okay Midwest so we have Midwest
Northeast and southwest so you might
have found that the previous uh number
was a little same right so that's due to
if you due to this if you try to detect
the
connection we can't detect any
relationships on selected PIV data right
so why did that happen if you go into
the p p window so here you can see the
data on all these things right and when
you go to the state regions you don't
find the state code which is com which
should have been common in both these
right so if you go to the diagram view
so when you look at the both the tables
you don't have a common key in between
these two but when you go to another
table in uh Excel we have something
called state code these to so that we
can establish a connection between sales
state regions and store regions so let's
do that let's go to data
View and now go
to one which we
created we don't need
the to
home data and get data from
stores store locations data
locations load
to create connection only add this data
to the data
model now everything is fine now we have
three regions or sheets Regions
locations and sales now create the pivot
table you can actually add in the
existing worksheet select the location
here it is so now we have loaded all the
three tables locations table and sales
table which is right over here and also
the state regions now let's go back to
the power pivot which is right over here
and go to diagram View and here we have
it now we have the state code here drag
it to attach it to the state code region
over here correct that's one
relationship and the store ID which is
here hold and drag it to the store ID in
sales region now we have established a
connection between all these three
tables you can just simply save it if
you want and now okay let's cancel and
now if you try to
identify the region byse sales now you
can do it
let's add locations region to
row drag it and add it
here and from sales select order number
and add it to values so it's
automatically to count so we are
counting the total number of sales
happened in Midwest Northeast and South
and in case if you wanted to add more
about let's say store details you can
also add that from
state code or state so let's select
state and Rag and drop to rows and now
if you can expand our contract this so
here you have a Consolidated table alog
together with statewise and region wise
sales and their numbers right so that's
exactly how the power pivot works so you
don't have to use any lookup formulas
you don't have to add some mathematical
calculations it is just creating a
relationship which looks something like
this you're creating a relationship and
it is extracting the data and you know
creating a Consolidated data table just
like you wanted so this exact same
method is implemented in PBI as well so
let's quickly go to PBI window and start
PBI and try to experiment the data
modeling in PBI as well should take a
little while so there you go you have
the powerbi window close this and just
get the Excel
data so we added uh the first one there
you go select the sales team load the
data since it's already processed no
need of data Transformations and data
cleaning this data is already clean and
neat right now let's also add the other
data sets we have it'll take a little
while but it's all right so the sales
team has been successfully added now we
will add region data select the state
regions load it it takes a little time
but it's all right now we have the state
regions as
well product data select the product
data table preview is fine press
okay so we have
products and four down two more to go
select locations
data load
data customer data five down and one
last one to
go sales data there you
go select the sales
data and now we have loaded all the six
tables to powerbi now unlike Excel so if
you remember
this if you remember this so we have uh
you know manually created the
relationships between the tables but one
good reason why we should prefer PBI is
it can help you automatically uh you
know establish relationship with other
tables so if you go to manage
relationships over here you have an
option called autod detect so will
automatically detect the relationships
between the tables and it will create
the relationships so you can find it in
here in
options options and settings go to
options here so not that modeling one so
it'll give a new window on the screen
and here you have an option called Data
load relationships so inut relationships
from data sources on first load or to
detect new relationships after data is
loaded in case if this are not checked
then you can just check and press okay
and your data model will be ready for
creation Now here let's create a table
data Matrix data double click on this so
that you have one here just like the one
we created previously just load the
locations so we had region in region
yeah here we have it right just load
region to
rows and maybe you can also add state to
rows and uh you can count the number of
orders we received so it should be
available in the sales data so number of
store ID discount order quantity order
date order number so every order is
unique so I think order number should be
fine you can add order numbers and
values and it can be
can count
it and you have okay let me expand this
if possible okay let me close all
this Mo so this should help us so just
like the pivot table what we created
there we have the same pivot table here
so that's how you can create the
relationship between all the tables in
your data set and and you can create a
perfect data model to create the
visualization of your choice so with
that uh back to report and here you have
the report view table View and model
view so if you check the have tables you
have customer table view location table
view products table view so if you're
attending an interview then there are
chances where you might be tested about
your skill set like if you really know P
not so they might ask what stable what
is model view what is report view so the
view where we create the reports or
visualizations is the report View and
the view where you can just have a look
at the data how it is is called as the
table View and this is the model view
where your data is loaded and powerbi
has automatically established the
relationships between all the tables
remember in P pivot we manually created
these relationships but here you can see
in Excel power pivot we had to manually
create the relationships but here in
powerbi you can see powerbi has
automatically created the relationships
so here it has oneway relationship so if
you double click it you can make it two
way so it's not single way anymore you
can make it both the ways and it has a
onetoone cardinality relationship here
right so it it has locations and state
regions so you can find out what type of
relationship is built and what type type
of cardinality has been established
between any two tables or any any any
number of tables which are involved in
this P bi data model right and that
brings us to the end on this topic of
data modeling in PBI so this was the
previous model which we created and
that's the new model which we just
created right now and with that we have
come to an under of this session if you
