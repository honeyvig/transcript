happiness this is dr srikanth
from team mds conquer now i'm here
to discuss few important aspects related
to the instrumentation
in endodontics so coming to the
two most commonly used slow speed
rotary instruments are the gg drills
and the piezo rms okay so what is a
peculiar difference how you can identify
these digitals okay the gg drills are
basically useful for
one is orifice opening or orifice
enlargement
second one is deeper penetration into
straight canals
to remove any obstructions and by
removing the
lingual shoulder in the case of your
mandible or anteriors
means the cutting area will be of lesser
dimension
whereas your piezo remembers the primary
purpose of piezoermers
is the pore space preparation whenever
you have to prepare a pore space you
should have a longer
cutting area right so by which you can
easily differentiate
your gz drills and the piezo immerse
piece
p simply you can remember as pose space
support space should be of longer length
so easy to identify the piezo remember
and the gg drills okay further important
things to be focused are
it has a flame shift which has a flame
shaped this looks like a flame right
so gg drill has a flame shaped
end okay and it has a long
thin shaft and it has a
latch type shank okay it has a latch
type shunk
and it has a long thin shaft
okay what is this use what is this use
so because
it has a long thin shaft end
and a flame shaped head with a safety
tip
okay you have a safety tip here this tip
is very safe
and this safety tip always helps in
guiding
into the canal it always helps in
guiding into the canal
and the safety tip also prevents the
occurrence of perforations and it has
his cutting edge on the lateral sides
which can be gently moved epically
direct epically with some sort of
pressure to
open the orifice and the main use of
this
thin area is whenever
this cutting edge is fixed into the
dentin
okay the instrument will breaks at this
area this is the weakest area where the
instrument is going to break
whenever it breaks at this area it is
very easy for you to retrieve out means
whenever the fracture segment
the broken fracture segment can be
easily removed
that is a basic advantage with which it
is
prepared okay make a note it has a
safety tip
the safety tip is always going to guide
you
what are the primary uses the primary
use is the removing of the lingual
shoulder during axis preparation the
anterior teeth
and the enlargement of the root canal
orifices are the two main functions of
the g g drills the second one is the
piezomers already discussed
piezomers are useful basically for the
post-space preparation okay apart from
the post press preparation
they can also be useful in removing of
cut apache okay
cut apache can be removed i mean the
instruments which are useful for removal
or cut apache even with hand instruments
you can remove
the best hand instrument to remove the
gp is uh
your h file or you can use c plus plus
file also to remove the
gp and the similarly you have chemical
plasticizer techniques also
to remove the gutter patch and similar
way during the post-space preparation
piezorimer can also be useful to remove
the
gadapachar okay so these are the
important things
that you have to make a note
so apart from this uh the other
important things like both these
piezo rms as well as the gg drills they
are
inflexible okay so when you have an
inflexible rotary instrument it should
be used at a
low speed so they can ask you what
what is the speed that is used the speed
is 750 to
1000 rpm is the speed that is regularly
useful
for these instruments and the next one
as in today's examination
okay there were few questions given on
just by giving an instrument they are
asking the size
of the instrument many of you has doubts
okay how a gz
are a piece of mr size is
identified is by counting the number of
rings
on the instrument you can see here this
gg has one
two three four it has four rings okay
so it is number four gg
whereas your piezo has one two three it
is number three
piezo remember okay so make a note
basing up on the number of
rings you are going to know the number
of
the number of the number or the size of
the gz drill or the piezo rimmer
i hope it's very clear right so now you
can easily identify
by counting the number of rings and you
can tell the size of the
gg or piezo so how okay the number
ranges from one
two three four five six
gz starts from point five at
zero point two point seven 0.2
0.9 0.2 1 1
0.213 0.215
clear simple now when you are counting
piezo
piso okay piso means it's already said
by seeing the diagram you can tell the
pizza is a bit bigger
bigger brother so when compared to the
smaller brother the bigger brother will
have
point two extra so it is zero point two
next size will have plus two
next stage will have plus two nexus will
have plus two excel will have plus two
okay so it starts from zero point five
to one point five it starts from zero
point seven to one point seven
piso is bigger brother
so point four extra every every piece of
same number of gz to p0.2 extra will be
there you can see all point two extras
right i hope this is clear
a few people were very confused about
this how to identify how to
by simply giving the diagram how we can
tell the size the size can be tell by
counting the number of
rings on the instrument okay
so done for now signing off dr srikanth
