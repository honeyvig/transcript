so without further ado let's get started
with our one point agenda that is mis
reports in excel
so first let's understand what exactly
is mis report in excel
so mis stands for management information
system mis reports provide data on
different categories for accurate
decision making
so mis in excel is a procedure to create
interactive report using microsoft excel
so mis reports help management to access
the performance of organization and
allow faster decision making so if you
know to create the mis reports using
various business intelligence tools such
as excel then you might find a very good
job opportunity in a well established
company now let us try to learn how to
create mis report using excel in a
practical mode so let's get back to the
microsoft excel if getting your learning
started is half the battle what if you
could do that for free
visit scale up by simply learn click on
the link in the description to know more
so here you can see that i've got some
sales data of various car manufacturing
companies and i've also got some slices
so using these slices i can get the
real-time information from the dashboard
so i'll select an ear from the first
slicer and i'll go into the second
slicer and i'll select a company
now i'll select bmw and suv type so we
have the data of all the suv types cars
manufactured by bmw car manufacturing
company in the year 2018. now let's
start and create something similar to
this one
so how did i create this mis report
let's go through this in a step-by-step
way
so on my screen you can see that we have
created a completely new excel workbook
and we have some sample data
with 5 rows and 20 columns
so this particular data is based on the
manufacturer year and the car
manufacturing company and the type of
the car manufactured and number of cars
manufactured in that particular year and
also the price of that particular car
now to create mis reports we need to
play around favorite tables so we also
have tutorials on pivot tables and you
can go through that in our simply learn
youtube channel and also we will try to
link those in the description box below
now let's select the entire data
and go into the insert ribbon
and there you can see the first option
that is pivot table
so after selecting the pivot table
option it will show this particular
dialog box where it will ask you for the
range of cells you need to select and
the next one is to
create the pivot table in this same
sheet or a new sheet so we'll take a new
sheet here
now select ok and there you have the
pivot table here so first you have an
empty pivot table and on the right side
you can see we have pivot table fields
now you can either drag these options
into the rows and columns or you can
also click it so now let's drag and drop
these
first we will select year
and
card
followed by that we will take type
quantity and price to columns
so there you go we have our pivot table
now
let's select all the data in the pivot
table
and again let's get back to the insert
option
and here you can see an option called
pivot chart select that
and you will have various pivot chart
options here now you can select any one
which you can prefer or which you like
or whichever you think can represent
your data in a best way possible so now
let's go with column chart first
let's select okay and we have our column
chart over here
now this happens to be our first chart
now let's create a few more charts
so to create few more charts we will go
back to the same original data
select again insert and pivot table
now again a new worksheet
so here we have another empty pivot
table
in the similar way let's drag the same
data into rows and columns
there you go and again we will select
all the data and create a pivot chart
go to insert option favorite chat and
now let's try to select pie chart
select ok
and we have our pie chart over here
now let's try to create one more
same procedure select table select pivot
table then create new worksheet for the
new pivot table
and now drag and drop the data
now let's go to insert again
let's select all the data
go to insert option and pivot chat
now let's try to select the bar chart
select ok and there we have our bar
chart
now
remember the first chart we created that
is in sheet 2 this one so we will try to
move all the charts to this particular
table or this particular worksheet
so let's get back to the sheet number
three right click
and you can see an option called pivot
chart analyze so from here
you can move the chart select the option
of moving the chart and don't select the
first one select the object in option
and select the sheet number to which you
want to move this chart for now we want
to move this chart to sheet number two
select that press ok
now we have the chart move to the sheet
number two
and in the same way let's go to the
sheet number four
and let's move this particular chart to
sheet number two
there you go the chart got moved to
sheet number two
now
you can insert the slices
so we have selected the third sheet or
third chart and inside the pivot chart
analyze option we have an option of
inserting the slicer now
we will insert the slices for year
car
and
type
now select ok and you will have all the
three slices onto your sheet
now let's rearrange them
so i'm just organizing them in a
neat way
there you go
and you can also customize your designs
for all the charts
so that they look a little more better
now
if you see
if i make some changes only one chart
will be interacting for this
right so if i select ferrari and year
2020 and
option as sports you can see only one
chart is interacting to these particular
slices why because all these slices are
connected to just one chart here so you
need to make sure that all the slices
are connected to all the three charts
what we created so let's erase all the
filters and select one slicer at a time
right click and you will see an option
of report connections
select that and you see that the
connections are only connected to the
pivot table 3. so select the remaining
pivot tables as well select ok and in
the same way select the second slicer
select the report connection option
connect pivot table 1 and 2 and select
ok and in the same way the third one
so now all the slices are connected to
all the pivot charts now if you make
some changes here they will respond
automatically in the same way
now let's select the fourth company the
year 2019 and hatchback option and you
have all the cars which were made in the
year 2019 from ford company in the
segment of hatchback
so this was the sample data set that we
worked on now you can also work on some
complex data sets such as this
superstore data set
now one thing you need to make sure that
when you're working with excel mis they
need to make sure that all the macros
are disabled on your data set and you
convert the entire data into the regular
table format of excel right now excel is
considering this particular data as a
database so for that you need to select
all the data press ctrl t and then
convert the entire data in the form of
tabular data and also don't forget to
click this icon which reads my table has
headers so the first row is the headers
now let's select ok and your entire data
will be converted into tabular form
now let's reset this to the normal
type which has the clear color not all
the fancy colors now the entire data is
converted from the dbms to the tabular
form and now he can start implementing
the mis reports and pivot tables so
that's how you work on mis report in
excel with that we have come to an end
