hello everyone welcome to this tutorial
on go concurrency by simply learn
in this session you will learn about
what concordance is
and how parallelism is different from
concurrency
after this you will learn about
concurrency in go
you will get to know go supports
concurrency with core routines and
channels here we will take a day get
knowing go routines
and their properties
further we will learn about channels so
hey everyone i am abhisaruja from simply
learn and welcome to this video on goku
currency but before we begin if you love
watching tech videos subscribe to our
channel and hit the bell icon to never
miss an update let's start with what is
concurrency
concurrency is a process that deals with
loads of activities operating
simultaneously
let's understand the concept with the
help of an example
let's consider a person driving a car
while driving he feels hungry and
reaches a drive-through and collects a
food parcel
he holds his car into a parking lot eats
the food and heads to his home here the
person is capable of performing both the
action simultaneously that is having his
food while driving but he performs
actions in a sequence this is
concurrency
moving on we will understand how
parallelism is different from
concurrency
both parallelism and concurrency produce
the same result but with different
approaches
parallelism is the process to perform
various sections simultaneously
particularly not in sequential order
let's understand parallelism with the
help of an example discussed during
concurrency
let's assume the person is driving the
car and simultaneously eating the food
in this scenario the person performs
both actions simultaneously that is
parallelly
this is parallelism
parallelism doesn't always result in
faster execution time in parallelism
actions are performed parallelly in
multiple course creating the need for
components to communicate with each
other
where concurrent systems have a low
communication overhead
now understanding the differences we
will had to understand concurrency in go
programming languages like python and
java use thread pools to execute
concurrency
whereas go has built-in features go
routines and channels to achieve
concurrency
go routines are much easier to manage
than thread pools that are purely
operated by the operating system
go works on the communicating sequential
processes csp concurrency model
now we will understand how go routines
and channels operate in concurrency
model
first we'll head with go routines
a go routine is a function that executes
concurrently with other functions or
core routines
go routines work in the background while
the main part of your program goes on to
do something else
go routines are not os threats
to work with go routine you have to
prefix the go keyword to the function or
method a go routine is a lightweight
thread managed by the go runtime
now we'll understand the usage of co
routine with the help of an example
first we will go through the properties
of go routines
every program consists of at least one
go routine and that go routine is known
as the main core routine
go routines are deeply integrated with
go's runtime course runtime monitors go
routine behavior suspends them when they
become blocked and then presumes as they
are unblocked
go routines are inexpensive compared to
threads they possess only a few kb in
stack size and the stack can expand and
contract according to the application
whereas the stack size is fixed in the
case of threads
now we'll understand the go routines
with the help of an example
here in this example we would be
passing 11 and 77 as a string to the
function number
and then printing it
with the loop seven times
so here inside the package main we will
declare a function number
and pass a string to it
inside the function number will run a
loop seven times and print the path
string
to print we have imported fmt package
now in the function main we will call
number function and pass 11 and 77 as
string
we will save the file
here i have saved the file with the name
concurrency.com
and we'll open the terminal
and run the file with the command go run
and then the file name
we have to make sure to perform this
operation in the same directory where
the go file is saved
here
we will write the command go
run and then the file name that is
concurrency
dot go and press enter
we can see
that we got the output as 11 and 77
seven times each
in the main function first the control
will be shifted to the
number function
where be pass 11 it will get executed
and then the control will come back to
the main function
and then the control will be shifted to
the function number
when we pass
77 to it it will get executed and print
77 seven times now the control will be
shifted to the main function
and the program terminates as there are
no other lines of code to execute in
main function now we will be
implementing go routine
for that we will use the prefix go
before the function number
we will write the go keyword before the
function number we will pass the string
11
and we will save the file
and run the command in the terminal go
run concurrency.go and press enter
here we can see
only 77 as the output would get printed
seven times
we have released a thread
go
but never waited for it to come back
that's why we have only voted
the output as 77
to get the go thread executed we'll use
the sleep method in a program
for that we will write
time
dot sleep
and inside the
circle brackets
we will
mention the time for one second
for that we have to import the package
time
now we will save the file
and
run it
here we have used the sleep method in a
program through time package that will
help the main go routine sleep for one
second
and in between one second the new go
routine executes the space 11 as output
and then terminates
after one second the main core routine
reschedules and performs its operation
we can see the output
1177 11 77 77 11 77 and goes on
now we are done with the example let's
move to channels
go routines communicate with other
elements through channels
channels can be thought of as a passage
through which go routines communicate
the channel is defined using the make
function and the chain keyword
each channel has a specified type
defined with it
this type of data is only allowed to be
transported by the channel
the zero value of a channel is nil
and they are not of any use until
defined channels are designed to prevent
race conditions when assessing shared
memory using code routines
with that we have come to the end of
