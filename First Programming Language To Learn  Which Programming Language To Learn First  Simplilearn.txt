the evolution of software development
has reached greater heights in the
recent times the current id industries
demand the most efficient and updated
software development skill in the market
and there is no better way than upgrade
your skills
hey everyone welcome to yet another
exciting video from simply learn in this
session we will be discussing the first
programming language but before we begin
make sure that you have subscribed to
our youtube channel and don't forget to
hit that bell icon so that you can never
miss an update from simply learn however
before we begin let's take a look at the
agenda for today's session first we
shall begin with learning what exactly
is programming
then i will walk you through our next
topic where we will understand why we
need to learn programming
then we dive deep into learning the
history of programming
after that we shall begin with learning
the first programming language later we
will walk you through learning what
everyone looks for in programming and
how it impacts one's career
after that we move into the next section
of top and trending programming
languages
finally we will wind up the session by
discussing the steps to improve
programming
i hope i was clear with the agenda now
let's start with our first topic
what is programming
programming is the process of designing
and building executable programs to work
on specific tasks that involves analysis
generation and implementation of
algorithms many of the applications and
development involves and uses
programming
programming involves tasks such as
analysis and generation of algorithms
resource consumption and profiling of
algorithms and the implementation
there are a few words of programming now
let's have a look at why exactly we need
programming
these days programming has become one of
the biggest advantages for implementing
and developing new and trending
technologies the applications and the
technologies implemented are ruling the
world
there is a huge demand for coders and
programmers which is the most
significant benefit in the career growth
of a person
these help to grow the knowledge and
methodology and increase the ability to
think profoundly and update the new ways
of living
it is a great opportunity and a way to
start a business because of the
advantage and the growth in this
software field
there are a few reasons why we need
programming now let's see some of the
history about programming languages
in the year 1954 fortran was invented by
ibm at the team led by john backus
it was the first widely used high-level
general purpose programming language to
have a functional implementation instead
of just design on paper
when fortran was first introduced it was
viewed with skepticism due to bugs
delays in development and comparative
efficiency of hand coded programs
written with assembly
the first high-level programming
language was blankakul developed by
connaught zeus for his z1 computer
between 1943 and 1945 but not
implemented at the time
other languages still in use today
include lisb invented by john mccarthy
and cobol created by short-range comedy
so this was some history about the
programming languages now let's dive
into learning the first programming
language
the first functioning programming
languages designed to communicate
instructions to a computer were written
in the early 1950s proposed by john
mccauley's short code in 1949 it was one
of the first high-level languages ever
developed for an electronic computer
later in the year 1954 fortran was
invented by ibm by a team led by john
backus it was the first widely used
high-level general purpose programming
language to have a functional
implementation instead of just a design
on paper when foreground was first
introduced it was viewed with skepticism
due to its bugs
it is still a popular programming
language for high performance computing
and is used for programs that benchmark
and rank the world's fastest super
computers
now let's understand what everyone looks
for in the programming these days
learning many programming languages is
tough so people look and choose the best
one which can be easy to understand
companies also look for employees who
are good at programming and coding
almost all the people with the best
program and knowledge will have great
ability to improve the business
development is easy when we are good at
programming and coding the knowledge of
coding and programming also impact much
growth in career and opportunities now
let's have a look at how it impacts
one's career
at present the demand for software is
increasing and it requires a lot of
developers and engineers to develop the
applications which is a huge advantage
a lot of jobs are available and it holds
a key advantage in choosing the best
carrier it is pretty easy to find a job
with good skills programming also
improves the ability and knowledge of a
person and makes them more confident
now
let's see some top end trending
programming languages at present
so the first one in the list is python
python is the most preferred programming
language because of the syntax of python
programming can be very easy to
understand for every level of reader and
this programming language is also loaded
with libraries that help in implementing
scientific computing working in
deployment in python are supportive and
easy in any kind of environment
and next one in the list is java in the
modern time java is the best language to
choose
nearly thousands of applications
software and development tools are built
using the java programming language this
technology is mainly used in creating
websites such as youtube google amazon
and many more
and the third one in the list is c sharp
c sharp is a general purpose multi
paradigm programming language
c sharp encompasses static typing strong
typing lexically scope imperative
declarative functional generic object
oriented and component oriented
programming disciplines the fourth one
in the list is javascript javascript is
responsible for fast and secure
development the main advantage and
perspectives are to provide more
interactivity with the users and coders
it also helps in expanding innovative
technologies which involve animation
gaming and rendering
and the fifth one in the list is r our
programming language is very scalable
and makes it easy to build aesthetic web
applications
this language is mainly developed by
using statistics and data science
knowledge r acts as a cross platform
because of the ability to run on any
operating system
the fifth one on the list is php
php is a general purpose scripting
language geared towards web development
it was created by danish canadian
programmer rasmus lardoff in 1994. the
php group now produces the php reference
implementation php originally stood for
personal home page but now it stands for
recursive initialism php
now let's have a look at the final
section of the session where we will
discuss about the steps to improve
programming the main problem in learning
is consistency when we work in our free
time it doesn't help much because of the
power of our brain working daily helps
in gaining and boost up our knowledge
and helps in thinking logically and
improve our skills so we have to work
every day to learn programming
if you're going to learn something you
must start from the beginning it helps
to predict and provides a complete
understanding of the upcoming topics if
you're learning coding or programming
you better start from the basics it
helps you more to grab the attention
over the subject and improve your coding
and programming knowledge
one of the accessible sources of
learning coding and programming is
online resources there are plenty of
online resources like simply learn etc
these platforms offer free courses and
videos with the best concepts that you
have ever seen one of the accessible
sources of learning coding and
programming is online resources there
are plenty of online resources like
simply learn etc these platforms are
providing and helping much in learning
they also offer free courses and videos
with best concepts that you have ever
seen
when you get deeply involved in the
subject we are learning it provides a
way to gain more knowledge and attention
over the subject the deeper we put in an
effort the more we get back it also
helps us in improving our thinking
skills it boosts the performance while
performing the tasks
and this was all for today's session i
hope now you guys have got an idea of
the first programming language and where
to start
