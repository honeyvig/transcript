agenda that is hyperlinks in excel
now hyperlink is something which is
clickable and when you click on it it
will redirect you to a different webpage
to a different worksheet or a different
location in your local system so there
are a variety of options and we will
explore all of them using excel
now creating a hyperlink is really
simple we have multiple ways now let's
write some text on the excel worksheet
i'll write simply long
now creating a hyperlink is really
simple you have multiple ways the first
simplest shortcut is
clicking on the cell where you want to
place the hyperlink and holding control
key and pressing k
now this will enable the hyperlink menu
box or the dialog box this is the first
way
and let me close it
now again we have selected the cell
there is another option where you have
to click on the insert menu on the
toolbar and navigate to links group
click on the link option
and you will again have the dialog box
of the hyperlink in excel
and the third way is right click on the
cell
and you can see the link option the last
and this will enable the hyperlink
option in excel
now let's create a hyperlink the
simplest way again ctrl k
now we have a variety of options that is
existing file or web page place in this
document create a new document and an
email address so we will address all of
these
one at each time so first one existing
file or a web page
now you can select an existing pdf file
or any file in your local system and
hyperlink or create a hyperlink to the
text or you can select a website a link
and place it over here and create it as
a hyperlink let's explore both the
options
first let's try to explore the web page
option so since i have written as simply
learn let's use the website link of
simply learn and create a hyperlink
let me open google
new tab and let me type simplylearn.com
let me copy the hyperlink
and now let's get back to the excel
workbook now here let's place the
hyperlink
now you can press ok
and there you go the hyperlink has been
successfully created now this link is
clickable when you click on it it will
redirect you to a new simply learns home
web page right so this is how you create
a hyperlink to a website
now
we shall explore another option that is
using an existing file right let's
create a new text box here let's name it
as existing
file and okay existing file should be
good
again the same you can either click
uh you know right click and select
hyperlink or ctrl k
now
let's select existing file or web page
option
now here you can see navigate key press
on that
and let's navigate our files
let's select all files here remember to
select all files
okay by default it shows as office files
now let's explore
our file option
so let's select a fundamentals of
computer programming option
which is a pdf file
press ok and there you go we have
created a hyperlink so when i click on
this you can directly navigate to an
existing pdf file in your local system
and it will be open as a web page
click on it and you can see the pdf file
now close
now another thing when you navigate onto
this you'll see the lendia http uh
address and same happens here right so
if you're a little uncomfortable
watching this lengthier link you can
also edit it you can choose the option
of edit hyperlink
and
see the screen tip option
click on it
and
here
you can change the text to display
option
and write it as
click here
to know more
press ok
again press ok and now if you navigate
onto it instead of seeing a lengthier
hyperlink what you can see is click here
to know more
okay i think i made a spelling mistake
so i think i forgot an e somewhere over
here yes
click here to normal
and press ok
right so here you can see click here to
no more let's try this again over here
so edit
edit hyperlink screen tip option and
instead of the lander text box or
hyperlink you can write as click to open
notes
or pdf
click ok
and click another ok and you are done so
instead of seeing that length here
hyperlink you can see click here to open
pdf right so so far we have explored two
options that is existing file
and
existing web page
right now let's try to explore another
option
again hyperlink right click hyperlink
and here you have seen places in
document right so which is like uh
okay let me
show this to you instead of telling you
so here what it is doing is you have the
cell a5
and you want it to refer to a1 or any
other cell in the same worksheet so you
can do that right so now for your
reference let me cancel it and let me
create a new sheet
and here
navigate me to here right let me write
this navigate me
to here
okay
so now what we will do is
so here we will create that nav gate
link
from using the hyperlink option
place this in this document you can see
the sheet option and the cell references
a1 where we have written navigate me to
here so when i click this a5 cell
okay let me also rename it
write it as navigate cell navigating
cell
right now
create that
ctrl k
let me select sheet 2 and the cell
address is a1 press ok
now what did what what's the change
right when you click on this you will be
redirected to sheet to cell a1 navigate
me to here right so
this can be like a shortcut when you
have multiple sheets like 100 sheets
then you can you know have a circle in a
different column over here and add the
navigation address to all those cell
links you can just click on that cell
and go into the different sheet and to
the specific cell which you have given
the address in our case i have given
sheet to address cell a1 right so this
is another trick now
let's get back to the
hyperlink thing again
uh ctrl k and another option is create
new document
so you might have been through you know
option of uh having
let's say some cheat sheets or
clip on clipboards right so let us
imagine that you're working through
a huge worksheet and
you wanted to you know have a track of
everything and keep notes updating right
so it might be a little complicated to
understand so let me show it practically
so let me write it down as clipboard or
sticky note
right
okay i think this has a hyperlink
lettuce like if this can be used no
worries
back to
a hyperlink option again
create new document
now
here you can create a variety of
documents right so it can be a text
document it can be an excel document it
can be a pdf document right for now
we'll create a text document okay
we'll name it as a tracker
dot txt
so this should create us a text document
and the location can be anything so you
can you know
take it as a desktop documents download
so let me take documents here
and select okay so i'll be having this
tracker.txt located in the documents
folder
and you can also choose to edit the
document later or edit the document now
let us select edit the document now
press ok and there you go so you have
your
text tracker here
so let us imagine that we have worked on
the excel sheet and we wanted to write
on us a sticky note so that we can
remember what we have done on the excel
sheet so update one
and
update to
now you can close it so it'll ask for a
save option save it
and
and let us imagine that you did
something else and you also updated
something else on the sticky note i'm in
excel sheet and you wanted to update
that on your sticky note so click on it
and you'll see a minor notice over here
from microsoft excel based on potential
security concerns you can select yes and
you'll be having access to your text
document again and write down your
update again here update three what you
have written right in the latest update
what do you have
and you can save it and close
so that's how you keep track of your
sticky note and you'll have all your
updates right
now getting back to the hyperlinks again
uh the last one is email address
so you can also try to add okay let's
imagine that you're working with a
colleague and every time you make an
update in your excel sheet or anything
and you wanted to send them out an email
right so it would be a little time
consuming that you open your email and
compose something and send it over here
but what if you had a one single click
and access to the email compose option
right that can be done so
let us write down
email
quickly
provide me with the spelling
so again the control k and hyperlink
select email option
and you can write down your email
which can be anything so you can write
down your friend's email address
so i'm just writing down some random
email here
friend gmail.com
and
you can write the subject about update
and
press ok
this will navigate you to the gmail
option or the mailing address options
click on it
and you'll have a variety of mailing
options outlook office 365 yahoo icloud
