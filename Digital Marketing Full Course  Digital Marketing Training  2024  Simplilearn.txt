Joey a digital marketer he works as the
head of digital marketing for Amazon but
how did Joey get here a few years ago
Joey began to see a large number of
opportunities popping up in the field of
digital marketing to begin his entry
into the field he needed to understand
what exactly digital marketing was and
what was so great about it first Joey
learned that digital marketing was a
form of marketing through which you
could advertise to people digitally
digital marketing leveraged different
channels like search engines websites
social media platforms emails and mobile
applications it would give marketers the
opportunity to interact with and
understand their audience better and to
increase the trust in their Grant did
marketing would also show marketers
advertisements to People based on their
actions and preferences on the internet
while being less expensive than
traditional forms of advertising after
understanding the main concepts of
digital marketing Joey realized there
was more to digital marketing than he
initially thought there are also many
types of digital marketing types like
content marketing search engine
optimization payperclick social media
marketing email marketing and affiliate
marketing and once he understood those
types he set up a digital marketing
campaign for his uncle's e-commerce
website let's have a look at what he
came up with first Joey created content
like blogs videos infographics and case
studies so that he could generate
audience interest in the Brand's
products or services this was content
marketing next he needed his audience to
actually see his content the first step
was to create content on specific Search
keywords that were relevant to the
target audience Joey would make
optimizations on the we it and have
credible websites linking back to the
content and lo and behold the website
began ranking on the first page of the
search results by continuous
optimizations Joey would continue to
improve the ranking and ultimately make
the website rank at the first position
this was SEO or search engine
optimization and Joey could do all of
this without spending a single penny he
could also Drive traffic to the website
with
advertisements but for this he would
have to pay a certain fee each time the
ads were clicked he could have text ads
that show up in search engine results
image ads and video ads that show up in
websites and much more this was possible
with the help of PPC or paperclick
however Joey wasn't done yet to reach a
larger audience he needed to tap into
social media platforms he would use
social media platforms like LinkedIn
YouTube Facebook and Instagram to
advertise the Brand's content he would
use these platforms to advertise the
Brand's products or services with posts
images videos and more to bring out the
Brand's story and engage with the
Brand's audience who spend a lot of time
on social media like PBC he could use
the platform to advertise the Brand's
products or services with text image and
video ads which needed to be paid for
that's social media marketing Joey
realized that a large amount of the
audience weren't visiting the Brand's
website a second time he needed to keep
them engaged nurture them to make sure
they purchase the product for this he
would send them emails that help them
better understand the products they
visited on the website and assist them
in the buying process he would also send
emails to advertise his products or
services to potential customers that is
with email marketing and finally
although Joey was able to grow the
Brand's funnel he wanted more traffic
from thirdparty websites this could be
achieved with affiliate marketing
Affiliates would promote the brand or
product to their audiences for a fee
with the help of email signups
registrations conver
subscriptions Etc after setting all of
this up Joey had the hardest part of the
process to get through the wait now as
we wait for the results let's take a
break and look at a quiz which one of
the following forms of marketing
involves engaging and nurturing your
audience to make sure they buy your
products or Services a SEO B PPC C email
marketing D affiliate marketing let us

happens at the end of Joey's weit
although Joey had worked really hard on
each of these forms of digital marketing
he only had moderate success that's when
Joey realized he had to gain more
knowledge and experience so he decided
to get certified and get ahead in his
career with the help of Simply learn he

imagine you have a fantastic shop in a

it because it stucked away in a corner
SEO or search engine optimization is
like putting up bright signs and arrows
that guide people straight to your shop
it helps your website stand out in the
vast online world making it more likely
for people to find and visit it so SEO
is like the friendly guide that ensures
your website gets the attention it
deserves bringing in more visitors and
potential
customers and for doing so a tool is
very crucial and one of the best tool
out there is SEO pow suit so SEO pow
suit stand out as the best solution for
all your SEO and digital marketing
requirements it offers four powerful
tools like rank record website auditor
ASO spy glass and Link assistant
providing you with a complete toolkit to
boost your search engine rankings unlike
many other SEO software options SEO
powerit offers a One-Stop shop for
optimizing your online presence and
achieving better visibility on search
engines all right now the question must
arise how do I use SEO power suit so for
that we will focus on four things that
is keywords on page SEO back links and
Link building and first we'll have to
focus on keywords for that we will be
navigating to rank tracker all right so
this is our rank tracker we'll double
click on
it so rank tracker is a valuable tool
designed to assist you in discovering
profitable keywords monitoring your own
rankings as well as those of your
competitors and conducting thoro
competitive analysis also it serves as a
comprehensive solution to enhance your
understanding of keyword and overall
market dynamics so first of all we'll
have to create a project over here so
over here we'll have to type the URL of
this website and so I will just type
here
b.com it's an e-commerce site all right
so now we'll click on next
then again we'll connect on next and
here you can enter the keywords if you
want and if you don't want then you can
proceed by clicking on
next here you can add more search
engines Google Bing Yahoo ask.com I mean
it's your choice if you want to add it
or not I just don't want to add all
these Google and Yahoo are sufficient
then we'll click on finish all right so
our project is getting ready all right
so it is loaded so first of all we'll
start by understanding the menu bar so
the menu bar is like the control center
like of rank tracker offering a set of
drop- down menus that help you manage
your projects and preferences so let's
understand first so this is file so this
menu handles basic commands relating to
your project such as opening closing and
saving files it's your goto for managing
project files efficiently then there is
preferences as we can see here in
preferences
uh you can set up Global configuration
for the application and customize
settings specific to each project it's
like the headquarters of triling rank
tracker to suit your needs then there is
window so window this menu provides a
list of supported hot Keys like keyboard
shortcuts and allows you to quickly
switch between different modules or
sections within the application it's all
about making navigation and action more
efficient so you can also learn these
shortcuts as well then there is help so
in The Help menu you can find
information about your rank tracker uh
license along with the links to online
help resources if you ever need guidance
or have questions this is where you can
find the assistance all right then here
comes the project as you can see project
this menu is like a project management
Hub it displays a drop- down list of all
the projects currently open in rank
tracker allowing you to easily switch
between them so only one project is
there so it is showing that only now the
next one is new so the new Option lets
you create a fresh project and then open
is there use this option to load an
existing project from your hard drive or
cloud storage then save we all know save
your open projects with this command you
can do that then close this option
allows you to exit then as we can see
check all so check all rankings in all
the open projects simultaneously with
this command it streamlines the process
of gathering information across your
various projects then you can also
login like found in the SEO power Cloud
login area this is where you log to
access Cloud related features all right
so this was about the menu bar now
coming to the sidebar so quickly let's
understand this one so first of all
there is the dashboard as you can see
project dashboard this is your project
Central Hub it provides a visual summary
of key statistics related to your
organic traffic ranking progress and how
well your competitors are doing it
serves as a quick gateway to all main
project sections then there is rank
tracking for in this moduel you will
find a list of keywords you're targeting
it shows their ranking history traffic
statistics keyword efficiency index Kei
keyword difficulty and other essential
data that you may need to update
regularly so it is like that all right
now as you can see next is keyword
research so here it is so here you can
explore new keyword ideas using over 20
different tools like it is in there the
module allows you to analyze and
categorize new keywords into groups and
move them to Target keyword section all
right so as we can see these are that 20
different tools the tools that we are
talking about then there is Sur analysis
that is SCP analysis this is for
in-depth keyword analysis it provides
you detailed analytical report on
websites competing with you for the same
queries then competitors research this
module enables you to research on
competitors based on domain or topic
domain strength it offers overall report
on your website's SEO strength showing
how it evolves over time then there is
reports this module is for generating
and you know delivering reports to your
clients and I think that would be
sufficient so we have already created a
project and while creating a project you
can add seed keywords that you know
describe your business or use the ones
the tool suggest then see where your
website stands for and it helps you
understand how well your site is doing
in search results so the next step would
be analyzing so first of all for
analyzing that first of all we'll have
to go to keyword research we click on
that and then ranking keyword is there
as you can see all right so now here you
can type the name of the competitor and
click search so let's just say I want to
type the name of the competitor the so
store let's say
all right now I click on
search make sure the URL is
correct and it might take some time it
is fetching something it is collecting
the keywords and then it will compare
the keyword profiles all right so this
is what it is this is the result and as
we can see keywords and this is organic
traffic this is URL of the sold
store and these are the keywords as we
can see so these are basically the
keywords for which the competitors are
ranking and access their performance we
can you can have the option to
investigate any competitor of your
choice or rely on rank tracker to
recommend the most relevant ones within
your specific Niche now after this you
can explore keywords with various
keyword research methods like keyword
Gap search console Keyword Planner auto
complete tools sated searches keyword
combination Etc so as you can see all
these are over here you can have a look
at these and explore these meanwhile we
can explore this keyword sandbox as you
can see keyword sandbox with the help of
this we can filter our keywords which is
the next step all right so this is
keyword
sandbox now we'll utilize the metrics
provided in the module to identify and
filter potentially lucrative keywords
eliminating those unlikely to generate
relevant traffic for our website so
Factor such a search volume as we can
see and keyword difficulty and
competition can guide you in selecting
Target keywords effectively so as you
can see these are the search volumes
and this is the competition competition
is high for this
keyword and keyword difficult is also
mentioned so you can filter out the
keywords according to your choice you
can either select or stop like track
like we can see so it's your choice you
can filter out the
keywords so whichever you don't want to
you can just click on it and it will be
tracked now your keywords will appear
also in the tracked keyword so like I
have tracked this one and this one so in
track keywords I I can have a look at
these all right so this was about it
next we will go to the website auditor
so website auditor ensures your website
is optimized on the page and checks if
it functions well technically and in
terms of content
optimization so we'll open the website
auditor and then we'll type
the website that is
d.com right we'll click on
finish all right so as you can
see to get a good ranking on search
engines it's important to optimize your
site first of all in terms of both
technology and content we will be using
website auditor for this job but before
that let's have a look at what all
things are there so first of all we'll
explore similarly that we explored in
the previous one so this is the menu bar
and I think we have explored this and
this is the sidebar it is bit different
from that so let's explore the sidebar
so site structure we have as you can see
this section organizes all the elements
of a website including its pages and
resources it provides like a visual map
of the site along with an audit
dashboard that accesses various Su
factors so as we can see page audit over
here now the page audit will do the page
level analysis so this was the function
of page audit then domain strength is
there so this feature offers
comprehensive report on overall strength
and performance of your website domain
showcasing its growth over time after
that there is reports this module allows
users to generate and share reports with
clients it serves as a tool to
communicate the findings and insights
obtained from the analysis of the site
structure and domain strength so this
was about the sidebar now we can start
with the little demo so first we have to
create a project project that we already
created and wait till the tool crawls
and collects all the pages on your
website so that we have done already now
we'll go to site audit so as you can see
here under site structure site audit now
after visiting site audit will address
each technical issue systematically
following the tools recommendations to
eliminate all the
discrepancies so as you can see we are
not able to see any error as you can see
error zero warning is one in mission is
one so there is nothing exactly to be
fixed but if there is some error or
something is there then we can easily do
that with the help of this tool all
right so next we can do is visualization
as you can see over here under site
audit you click on that now to ensure
visualization basically is used to
ensure your site is well structured the
tool transforms your website into a
visually intuitive app once generated
you can effortlessly sport an address
like issues orphan Pages isolated
sections redirects broken links and more
so this is what it is used for on the
right side you can arrange the pages
based on the click depth as we can see
click depth internal page rank page
views so on the right side this is the
right side and if you switch to internal
page link as you can see you'll click on
that you can see how the internal link
are spreaded like it is bit different
sorting my page views if would
see it lets you see which pages are
visited and viewed the most and least
but we're not able to figure it out as
of for that I think we'll be needing a
Google analytics account and we'll need
to log in with that all right so after
reviewing and addressing on page
optimization for the site let's revisit
the keywords you gathered in rant
tracker like use website auditor keyword
map as we can see keyword map for
keyword map we'll have to go over page
audit inside page audit it is keyword
map now this module automatically
identify the pages most relevant to each
keyword
group so the program will take a few
moments to harvest all the data for your
keywords and Pages for further analysis
first of all you'll have to type the
keywords all right let's
say I want to write
joggers
watch
printed
T-shirts
shirts
sliders
and you can write as many as givers you
want
jacket
hoodies
shs all right I think that is
sufficient now you can
also import from CSV so basically uh in
the rank tracker you can also download
and import from CSU or you can import
directly from rank tracker also now we
have wrote the keywords over here now
we'll click on create map now the
program will take few moments to harvest
all data for the keywords and the tool
automatically identifies the pages most
relevant to your keyword group or
specific keyword so this is showing only
one it should at least show five because
website auditor will suggest the top
five most fitting Pages for each keyword
of group
so we must add more keywords I
believe we can add manually or we can
just have a at rank tracker also like
hellfire club shirt we can
see can add
that all
right all right so still it is showing
one so after finding a match as you can
see we have find the match just H over
the page and click map app as you can
see we'll have to click on this or this
relevant it
is all right
so we'll have to hover over this and
we'll click on map now with the ready G
map ensure your landing page is optimize
for Target keywords now we'll go to
content audit first so here we can
adjust the target settings set the
default search engine for competitor
page and assign a specific one for the
current page so as you can see they are
showing the errors and
warnings so that we can improve on it
and as it is showing make your page meta
description approximately 22 word long
so it is showing how to fix also
basically and if we'll talk about
competitors we can see
Amazon and many other hm hm is there
American Giant
Nike so they have used the keywords
they're showing The Meta description it
is
showing all right so now coming to the
content
editor so this is content editor
basically what it does is to start
editing an existing page you will need
to choose between the editing modes
first of all as we can see so it might
take some time when you click on that
after doing that it might take like 5 to
10 minutes after it will show this
window now you'll need to choose between
editing modes browser mode is there and
do doent mode is there so let's just
select browser mode and let's click on
go you can easily you know edit this
site also and properly write an SEO
optimized title so as you can see 33.2%
optimization rate is there it is showing
and other than that we can click on
this and this is showing us manage
mapped keywords manage search engines so
manage search engines so this will
change the default search engine set a
separate search engine for the given
page this can be helpful when optimizing
for creating a regional or local page
and click manage search engines you can
also do that all right so the two top
Fields as we can see this one this one
so these two Fields will let you edit or
enter The Meta title and meta
description tags and you can see how
those fit into the intersections the
recommended number of characters based
on the best SEO practices so as you can
see 311 160 you can easily edit that and
make it SEO friendly also all your
target keywords will show up in the
mapped keywords as you can see the
mapped keyword hoodies
so the green here it is green so green
means okay orange if it was orange it
means almost there red as an alarming
for neglecting or stuffing so next to
each keyword as you can see you will see
the actual keyword Count versus
recommended so the recommendations are
customizable simply click on any chip to
manually change the
recommendation so you can do that then
the recommend recommended keywords this
section will list the keywords that have
been extracted from the top ranking
pages of your competitors so you can
also include
these as per your
choice and then you can save in an HTML
document from here and you can reset
from here
and save so once finished save the page
and upload it on your website so now
let's just go to back
links now for back links we'll have to
go to SEO spy glass it is a useful tool
for checking backlinks it helps you
gather and analyze your own backlinks as
well as those of your
competitors so it's a good tool so again
we can write the website URL so we'll
type
b.com all right now we'll click on
next Su power
suit and we can also change this as per
our
choice let's
say We'll click on so these were the
number of back links so I've wrote
10,000 so it is collecting back links as
of now please wait while SE SP glass
collects backlink statistical data and
builds up the project okay so these are
the number of backlinks that this site
has
130,000 domains
9,622 and IP is
8361 all right so these is is the this
is basically the
data so search engines prioritize
websites that have backlinks from
reputable domains conversely an
abundance of backlinks from spammy sites
can negatively impact your domain's
reputation also considering this it is
advisable to access your existing
backlink profile before embarking on an
any efforts to build it further so this
involves examining and evaluating all
the back links already directed to your
site so we are going to do that and SEO
spy glass is one of the best tool for
that so step one find the pages linking
to your site for that to gather all the
backlinks directed to your site you need
to initiate a new project in s y spy
glass that we already did and now we can
navigate to backlinks
profile and click on
backlinks all right so the tool will
examine its index and identify all the
backlinks providing a variety of useful
metrics essential for further
analysis so as you can see backlink page
domain in link rank link page links back
so all the back link pages are there
it is also showing
130k back links all right now coming to
the linking domains so in linking
domains module you can quickly switch
between all domains new or lost
ones and additionally set the program to
show all tlds or filter out any specific
one
like.
inor
g.net so like
that all right now the anchor text so
the anchor texts module will show the
summary viset with the total number of
unique anchors and anchor diversity
diagram and backlink distribution of
anchor type the workspace will list all
the anchor texts associated with
backlinks in the project alongside
you'll see the states for each anchor
like link type as we can see and number
of pack links you can also see
847 and linking domains
also hovering over any cell in the back
links domains columns you'll see the
icon of expanding the list of URLs to
look through so as you can see these are
the backlink page list of
URLs all
right now let's move on to the referral
traffic and to analyze the traffic your
website is getting through the backlinks
turn to referral traffic module this is
the referral traffic module under backr
profile this is backlink profile if you
want to analyze your website you can
come here in your S Class once you click
the update traffic Button as we can see
over here update traffic
stats or this also will work no this one
only once you click on this the program
will ask you to connect your Google
analytics account and if you haven't yet
then you can enter it so this is how it
will work so once the account is
connected it will take few moments for
the program to gather the data from
Google analytics for the backlinks in
the project after the task finishes
you'll see the results in the workspace
you can then switch between views
linking domains and backlink pages so
the linking domain view will show the
overall number of referral sessions
received from each domain and the
overall bounce rate the backlink pages
view will show the more detailed data
referral session from each backlink page
and also the bounce rate for each linked
page
all right now let's navigate to backlink
profile and then we'll go to
summary So within this module examine a
summary you can like including key
metrics to identify both the strengths
and weaknesses of your site now we can
peek at your competitor's backlink
profile also now is the moment to access
your backlink profile in comparison to
your competitors achieving Superior SEO
performance is crucial for securing a
higher ranking than your competitors to
do that go to domain comparison first of
all as you can
see now this is our domain now here
we'll type the competitors's domain
let's like the so the sold
store. all right the spelling is wrong
the sold store it
is all right
click then there is
Snitch doco
doin all
right and one more is there let's
write
mantra.com
all right now let's click
okay so once this process is finished
will see a complete comparison of you
and your competitors's domains as we can
see bag.com the sold store snitch doco
doin minra now you can easily compare on
the basis of different metrics there are
various matrics over here and as you can
see there is a number
91% in terms of text links domain
strength 9.33 is of mintra and 7.99 of
pof.com and these are for snitch and
these are for soul store.com so you can
easily compare them on the basis of
different metrics all right now coming
to the next step which is spot the
dangerous links before progressing to
actual link building phase it's crucial
to address one final task identify and
remove potential and harmful backlinks
so for that we will go to backlink
profile then the penalty risk so
backlink profile this then we'll go to
penalty
risk all right so this is the penalty
risk it is showing 0% which is a good
thing so basically links with a penalty
risk of 70 to 100% are high risk and
should be checked right away as they
could lead to Google penalizing your
website basically links with a risk of
30 to 70% are potentially harmful so it
is advisable to examine them more
closely then links with the 0 to 30%
penalty risk are considered safe and
posst minimal or no risk in your link
profile all you have to do is to collect
those harmful links and get rid of them
so as you can see there are no penalty
risks so but I need to tell you how to
do that so we'll go to backlink pages
and we'll click on the particular link
as you can see so this button update
penalty risk so it will task Ed updated
backlink page data so it will update the
penalty risk all right so this was about
SE spy class now let's do the link
building with link
assistant so this link assistant
simplifies your link building tasks it
assists in discovering numerous link
building opportunities managing Outreach
and overseeing your link building
campaign directly within the app so
first of all we'll create a project and
specify the site and back link and
Target
settings all right so as we can see uh
we can like first of all we'll type
b.com right now so as we have provided
the web address select your desired
Target country so Target entry over here
and the language also you can select
from this
and other than this the app's search
engine will be tailored automatically
according to your preferences
Additionally you have the option to
include negative keywords in the top
block list so what this is the app will
analyze the backlink profiles of
potential prospects and eliminate those
containing the specified negative
keywords so if you want if you don't
want some negative keywords you can put
it here in the topic block list and that
will not be included all right so this
was it now let's create on I repeat now
let's click on
create all right so this is the layout
now so first by default this will
include the list of top 100 backlinks or
the competitors of your domain with the
highest s link Rank and you can select
any of the six predetermined methods as
we can see six predetermined methods or
the configure a customized search this
one configure a customized search using
the export mode this is the expert mode
basically so these options enable you to
conduct a focused search based on
specific type of Link Prospect you're
seeking if you lack seed keywords you
can utilize the get keyword suggestion
feature this function automatically
identifies your top 20 ranking keywords
that generate the highest
traffic all right so now step two would
be let's say let's explore this one
guest posting top 100 blocks we'll click
on this all right so by employing this
search technique you can identify the
top 100 prospects ranked by organic
traffic using specific search operators
related to your C keywords to initiate
the search input the seed keywords here
you will write down the seed keyword so
let's say I just want to write winter
Weare all right
and you can also do the search engine
settings but I think it is fine and tags
for Future Organization and management
but I don't think I'll be doing it so
after completing the search first of all
we'll have to click on find so let's
click on
this so these are the contact
information this is the page previews
and this is the prospect preview and
additional details are also there you
can select or unselect all the results
to be moved to the prospects like this
right so then we'll click on move to
projects on Hover move any result to
prospects to backlist or to the trash
also so let's just click on this we can
also click on remove Prospect but we are
not going to do that we'll just move to
prospects all right so these are the
prospect that you that we have moved now
that we have possess a recently compiled
list of potential links it is crucial to
access their quality and prioritize the
ones we intend to reach out to initially
we'll go to
prospects all right then we'll click on
a URL and update so here is the update
and select contact info so as we can see
contact info we'll click on okay now
that we have settled on the list of
factors you would like to check take
respective data by clicking on the
update button or any of the columns
header take the factors to be updated
like I click
uh contact information and press okay
like
that all right can do for this one
also all right so the next step is to
reach out to prospects utilize the app
to initiate Outreach directly taking the
convenience of having all the contact
details at your disposal by connecting
your email account to link assistant you
can centralize and organize your
campaign's correspondence efficiently
within the application
begin reaching out from the app since
you already have everyone's contact info
simply link your email to link assistant
and all your campaign messages will be
saved in one spot so you can just click
on this and then email so as you can see
domain. operations. web.com it has taken
the information from contact info and
once you have linked your account or
email then you can it will update over
here and then you can simply send it

is a strategic tool that not only boosts
search engine rankings but also
establishes a connection between your
content and specific terms your audience
employs making your online presence both
accessible and meaningful all right so
this was about what is keyword research
and why is it important now let's
understand how to do a keyword research
using chat GPT for that let's go to
google.com so as you can see we have
opened Google Now all we have to do is
to write first of all we'll write
aipm AI PM all right so AI PRM or a PRM
for chat gbt you can type now let's open
the first link we'll click on the first
link
so this is basically an extension it is
a Marketplace of prompts they provide
you prompts that you don't have to type
the whole prompt they have pre-made
prompts that you can use all right now
we can click on this add to Chrome
button over here ADD
extension
right so as you can see this is a whole
new outlook of this chat gbt this is
aipm prompt extension so basically they
give you pre-made prompts as you can see
this you used SE optimized content
writer fully SE optimized article
including so there are numerous as we
can see 4 580 prompts so you can choose
accordingly whichever prompt you want
and you can also search over here and
this is topic activity sort by you can
also sort and prompts for page you can
customize it according to yourself so as
you can see here is the topic uh we can
go to topic and we can select so we want
to basically do a keyword research we'll
go to SEO we'll click on SEO after that
in activity we can select this uh
keywords all right now as we can see
there are numerous prompts according to
what we have selected that YouTube SEO
keyword generator SEO optimize your
Google business profile Etc so we can
select as per our choice so what I have
figured out which is best is this one
keyword analysis I repeat keyword
analysis so as we can see find the table
of best keywords with search volume CPC
paid difficulty Su difficulty so for
those who don't know about uh CPC so uh
CPC or cost per click is a measure in
online advertising that represents the
amount you pay when someone clicks on
your ad it's essentially the cost of
each interaction with your advertisement
higher the CPC values often indicate
more competitive keywords or advertising
spaces and as you can see paid
difficulty is also written so paid
difficulty refers to how challenging it
is to compete for a particular keyword
in paid advertising a higher paid
difficulty score means that it might be
more expensive or competitive to bid for
that keyword in paid search campaigns so
now there is SEO difficulty so SEO
difficulty basically is a measure of how
hard it is to rank organically for a
specific keyword in search engine
results a higher s difficulty suggests
that it might be more challenging to
optimize your content to appear higher
in unpaid organic search results for
that keyword it takes into account
factors like competition and the
existing strength of other Pages ranking
for the same keyword so these are the
meanings of these things as we can see
so we have already clicked on this now
now as you can see seed keyword that you
search for so let's say uh I'm searching
for cloud computing let's
say cloud computing and let's click on
this so as we can see they are creating
all these now let's explore keywords
related to cloud computing along with
the respective search volume all right
so as you can see keyword these are the
keywords that we got and these are the
search volumes so we all know what
search volume is the number of searches
and the CPC as we already discussed what
is CPC again if somebody wants to know
about it CPC or cost by click is a
measure in online advertising that
represents the amount you pay when
someone clicks on your ad so these are
the amount you pay when someone clicks
on these ads all right so paid
difficulty again it refers to how
challenging it is to compete for a
particular keyword in paid advertising
so this is paid difficulty of of each of
these keywords then SEO difficulty SEO
difficulty is a measure of how hard it
is to rank organically for a specific
keyword in search engine results so
these are the uh Su difficulty so we can
select accordingly and the table index
is a mix of 100 keywords including
longtail LSI so longtail keywords are
also there as you can see we'll discuss
longtail keywords also after this so
this is how you can do keyword research
using chat GPT we'll do one or two more
regarding this so let's do another
example so we are going to select
keyword analysis and then we'll have to
put seed keyword remember to select SEO
first of all here we can see SEO and
then in activity you have to select
keywords because we are doing the
keyword research all right now after
selecting this keyword analysis we want
basic we basically want all these things
like search volume CPC pay difficulty s
difficulty so that we can choose the
write keywords accordingly so let's see
here we have to put the seed keyword so
let's say the seed keyword is let's say
devops all right let's click on
this so they are giving us the keywords
a lot of keywords they usually give
let's explore the keyword analysis for
devops so as you can see high search
volume very high search volume high so
these search volumes regarding these
keywords are shown and the CPC is also
showing
and paid difficulty SEO difficulty as
well so we basically want the SEO
difficulty to minimum like minimum or
like medium so we can search or extract
those keywords accordingly so they have
written this table includes a mix of 100
relevant longtail keywords LSI keywords
and FAQ related to devops it provides
insights into search volume CPC Coster
click P difficulty and SEO difficulty to
help optimize your content and reach the
target audience effectively so through
this you can select these keywords and I
think if you'll click on continue it'll
keep on going for more keywords so as
you can see longtail keywords now it is
showing so these are LSI keywords so we
will discuss these uh terms longtail
longtail keywords LSI keywords after
some time later in this I repeat later
in this video so this is how you can
simply do a keyword research using chat
GPT again this keyword research is
completely free you have you don't have
to pay a single Buck regarding this now
let's try another method of doing a
keyword research for that all you have
to do is to go to Google and we'll
type
keywords
everywhere all right so here's the first
link let's click on this this is another
extension install for Chrome we'll click
on install for Chrome now let it open
and now we can click on add to Chrome to
just add this extension in our Chrome
browser as as you can see ADD extension
so I think it is added now now all we
have to do is to pin this one all right
so now uh let's go to chat GPT let's
open a new
one so as you can see this is keywords
everywhere icon please continue as you
can see clarify explain rewrite so for
that to use this extensions powers or
functionality all we have to do is to
click on this template button all right
now here the thing is first of all we'll
select choose a category similarly that
we have done previously choose a
category so as you can see copywriting
marketing SEO social media productivity
professionals we'll select SEO because
we want to do keyword research then in
subcategory we can select keyword
research and because we want to do
keyword research then there's a template
so here we can see first is keyword
strategy so you can click on keyword
strategy if you want to do basically
strategize the keyword so basically I'll
tell you what keyword strategy is
keyword strategy involves planning like
how to use specific words or phrases in
your content to achieve specific goals
like it's about selecting and targeting
keywords that align with your overal
objectives whether it's to boost website
traffic increase conversions or enhance
your online visibility then there is get
search intent for keywords so it I
repeat so it itself tells what it is
like intent understanding search intent
for keywords means grasping the reason
behind someone online search it involves
figuring out what a person is looking
for when they type a particular keyword
into a search engine aligning your
content with users intent ensures that
your information meets their needs
improving the relevance of your content
then here is related keyword generator
so a related keyword generator is a term
or phrase closely connected to the main
keyword you're targeting including
related key words in your content help
search engines understand the content
and relevance of your page it's a way to
capture a broader range of search
queries related to your main topic then
there is longtail keyword so basically a
longtail keyword is a more specific and
detailed phrase usually consisting of
three or more words while these phrases
may have lower search volumes
individually they often attract a more
targeted audience longtail keywords can
be valuable for Niche topics are
generally easier to rank for the and
broader more competitive terms so these
are all these things so let's say first
of all I want to search for related
keyword generator and so first of all as
you can see category SEO subcategory
keyword research templates select
accordingly whichever you want I've
explained all these related keyword
generator I want basically when we'll
select related keyword generator this
will come up languages English we want
in English only here is the seed keyword
we'll have to write this is total
keywords how many keywords do we want
we can select accordingly basically I
want 40 itself so this is a prompt
template that automatically gets created
whenever you select a particular
template so let's say if I want to
select keyword strategy so it will
create itself a different kind of prompt
so if I'll select long tail then a
different kind of prompt will be
generated so this is a self-made itself
it will create a prompt all you have to
do is to write a seed keyword over here
so let's say as I said I want related
keyword generator and let's type here
devops all right so total keywords I
want 40 itself I'll click on execute
template all right so these are the 40
keywords that we wanted so related

are informational
so firstly they'll create a table
regarding these keywords after that they
will basically list of same keywords
separated by commas as we can see same

you can easily use them wherever you
want all right so this we have selected
for the what we call Related keyword
generator now let's select another one
let's click on template again we'll go
to related or let's say longtail keyword

digital revolution in the late 1990s
early 2000s Google ads formerly known by
the way as Google AdWords traces it
Roots back to early 2000s it was
launched by Google in fact in October

response to the needs of online

Google ads is a must in today's
competitive leral landscape yeah the
journey goes beyond the basics so we're

d dnamic yeah it allows you to get into
a dynamic conversation with your

insights to engage effectively with your

the groundwork and how and look at how
you register your business on the Google
ads
platform so let's kick off our journey
by registering your business on the
Google ads platform so simply go to
Google or the ads. goole.com
log in with your Google account and
initiate a process of connecting your
business with this extensive online
audience but before that let me quickly
show you this ads. goole.com page it
gives you lots of information and
knowledge about the Google ads platform
it can show you what you can do with it
how you can use it to achieve your goals
yeah you get you see a voucher that you
can get if you spend $400 you get 400 uh
pounds in add
credit so let's kick off your journey by
registering your business on the Google
ads platform so simply visit ads.
goole.com and you get to this website
which is kind of the entrance to Google
ads and on this website you find lots of
information about the Google ads
platform you even see here on the top
right right that they give you a foucher
for £400 in the UK yeah where you can if
you spend £400 on uh on Advertising so
you'll see they do that across the world
so you should be able to get those uh
those ad vouches as well so it gives you
lots of suggestions on the goals that
you can achieve the power of Google
advertising for your business and it
gives you some case studies as well and
what I really like about the Google ads
program
that you can actually get freeof charge
personalized support yep and by
scheduling a meet meeting with a Google
ads expert and I would highly um sort of
uh recommend you use that surface
because they can really help you with
setting up your first Google ads
campaign so let's go into this system we
can click Start now yeah or you can sign
in if you have an existing account so if
you click Start now it'll probably
immediately log to my existing account
but what it will do it will actually
give you an overview of the Google ads
accounts that you already have yeah or
you can create a new Google ads account
so this step forms the backbone for your
online identity and it gets you a an an
seamless integration between your
business and the Google ads um
environment as it were so very practical
steps to get you started on the Google
ads platform effectively so let's go on
to create a new Google ads
account so create a new
account and here it goes into the
process of cre creating a new Google ads
account so you need to add business
information you can then go straight
into creating your ads and set up your
budget now you can case go straight into
your first campaign and in the process
you will actually fill in your data to
sign up but what I advise you do here is
to skip the campaign creation that
you're not ready and then you will go in
a proper setup for your Google ads
so there's different elements that you
can do here so you give your billing
country you give your time zone your
currency if you want personalized
campaign guidance I would certainly
advise you take that as I mentioned
earlier yeah you fill that data in and
then you click submit and then yes to
continue I'll I'll select no for now so
click submit and then you're basically
all done and then uh The Next Step
what's going to happen is actually you
need to go through the verification
process now a few more steps here the
details are very important if you go
through the entire process like your
business name your physical location
your contact information it's not about
getting the data but it's about crafting
your digital presence yeah so it goes
beyond checkboxes make sure that you add
every step yeah that you fill in every
step in the
process okay so the next step is that
you will go through the verification
process when you've done that process it
is very important that you are going to
verify your account so how do you verify
your account you go back to your main
Google ads dashboard and I will explain
this dashboard a little later and you
click here on the billing and here you
see Advertiser
verification yes so here is where you go
into
verification
to make sure that Google recognizes your
account and understands that you are the
actual business owner of this account so
that gives you an extra level of
security and integrity on your Google
ads account and once you verify it yes
so B Google has then reviewed your
business details and you can ensure your
accuracy but it can also gives you a
good foundation for this for your
advertising experience so it's more than
Security checks it's about making sure
that your data is correct and you have a
solid basis to start your journey in the
Google
advertising entering the ads dashboard

in setting up your campaign it's also
very important to look at the structure
of your Google ads and the standard
structure of a Google ads campaign is to
in it's three fold there is the campaign
level there is the ad group and within
the ad group sits the um sit the ads and
the ads they inherit the setting of the
ad group and the ad group they inherit
the setting of The campaigns on campaign
level you talk about the objectives of
your campaign you look at the um the the
bidding strategy that you have for your
campaign in the the price that you the
budget that you want to assign in the ad
groups you can look at your keywords and
you can specify your ads as well so very
important that you think about that
structure and that will really help you
into organizing your campaign in a
structured manner
okay having gone through this dashboard
now let's jump into the Google ads
Basics and create a campaign and picking
the right keywords so to create a
campaign you just go to the campaigns
Tab and you click here the plus to start
or I can click here on the campaign step
I'm getting an overview of my
campaigns and um but in this case I just
click on the campaign tab the plus
button and that will take me to the sort
of the starting screen of my um Google
ad setup so I can decide my campaign
goal I can set a budget and I can pick a
bidding strategy so this is the
beginning of your ad game here you state
what you want do you want more clicks do
you want leads do you want brand
awareness how much do you want to spend
what is your bidding strategy do you
want to set it or do you want Google to
handle it yeah do you want more clicks
more
conversions and when you start this
process you're on the way to create your
first ads plan so here you
see
the different types of campaign
objectives that you can select and each
objective will kind of pre-select the
digital narrative within Google ads so
they serve different purposes whether it
is driving sales or driving website
traffic um or whether it is capturing
leads whether it is promoting your app
whether it is a local store visit
whether it is sales or a product and
brand consideration or you can also
decide de side to create a campaign
without selecting any of these and that
is for the more experienced people who
can who know exactly what to specify but
if you click one of these then Google
will automatically prepopulate kind of
the settings for you in the uh in the
Google ads screens that will follow so
aligning these types with your goals is
very important important and they ensure
that you get a very impactful digital
marketing approach to your customers so
let's click on one of them yes so let's
click for instance on the uh we want
website traffic so here you see what
type of
conversions that you want yes so that
could be page views that could submit
lead forms it could subscribe so you can
specify these conversion
and you just click here you click on
continue and here you select the
campaign sort of type that you want to
select want to to to run do you want a
search campaign do you want a display
campaign do you want Google to sort of
Select it for you yeah do you want a
shopping campaign a video campaign or do
you want a demand gen where you run ads
on Youtube Gmail and various other
channels so let's say we're going to
create a um let's start with a search
campaign yeah so you put in your website
your website address which in my case
would be this website you're going to
give your campaign a name and you click
continue I'm going to start a new
campaign and here it's very important
that you specify the bidding strategy
that you set as you know Google ADS
works with an auction system
you put in a bid for when what you will
pay uh when people click on your ad and
then Google in the auction when people
have actually put in one of your
keywords Google will then use different
methods for making sure that the um the
the best bit in combination of various
other factors wins as it were and shows
up at the top of the uh the advertising
listing on Google ads now the the
highest bidder doesn't necessarily be at
automatically be at the number one spot
there is also a quality score of your ad
that is impacting whether or not you
would show at the top so your financial
uh core rest on the budget and the
bidding strategy so determine your daily
budget yeah align it with your
advertising
objectives and uh it's very
important how you want to set this do
you want to run it for conversions do
you want to run it for clicks yep so you
can set a maximum cost per click or you
can let Google set that automatically
for you yep and when you're happy with
how you set it you click next and then
you specify where you want to show your
ads yep so here you see you can specify
the for the Google search campaign you
can specify the search Network you can
also show search ads on the Display
Network you can look at the network the
locations the languages you can specify
specific audiences or you can also do
some keyword matching for your search
campaigns there's various location
options they work very powerful yes so
you can spe specify by language you can
select audience segments so for instance
I would just do an advertisement on a
specific
sector so I can say give me just people
that are interested in
travel and they will then be added to
they will then be targeted with your
your
ads yep and and then here you're going
to specify your uh the type of keyword
match that you want
so uh so that is very important and as
you can see in the Google search ads the
keywords are very important but I'll
come back to that in a minute what I
first want to do is go through the more
settings where you will sort of open up
additional functionality that will make
you use um give you a more advanced use
of the Google ads like how do you want
to rotate your ads is there a start and
an end date for your campaign do you
have a specific ad schedule do you have
campaign URL options that is where you
want to um to track your campaigns or
Are there specific brand restrictions
that you do not want to associate with
your ads and the placement of your ads
so particularly on the ad schedule my
recommendation would be to select all
day when you start your ads let's Google
decid what is the best timings for your
ads that gives the best response what
you will see when you set up your ads
that you set up multiple ads and Google
will mix and match the ads and will
select the best combination of the ads
that will give you the best performance
and will also select the best timings so
the first couple of days that your
advertising campaign is running Google
will be in what we say learning mode and
it will do all the tests it will run the
various options of your ads and it will
sort of slowly calibrate your ad
campaign to the best format the best
settings and the best
structure so this type of
control yeah is not about just reaching
Your Right audience but it also does it
at the most opportune moments the best
times so it maximizes the effectiveness
of your uh your ads so very important
part of this is your keywords as I just
mentioned so for search campaigns here
is where you can specify your keywords
so what you can do you can get
suggestions from Google by entering your
website address and then Google will and
will sort of select the best keywords
for you and you can use those for your
search ads which means that every time
somebody types in any of these keywords
your ad will show to the to those people
depending on your bidding strategy or
you can add your own keywords based on
your keyword research and the tool that
are I showed you earlier the Google
Keyword Planner is a fantastic tool that
can help you in building those um those
those keyword lists for you now I'm not
going to go into the details here of
keyword uh research that may be the
topic for a future uh campaign so it's
very important that you align your
keywords with your business and that the
keywords resonate with your target
audience and make sure that you use the
key Google Keyword Planner to find the
right keywords or any other tools that
uh that are available in the market the
keyword is fundamental for your search
campaign it's not about what you say in
your ad but it is also how do those
keywords resonate with your
audience good that concludes the basic
setup of your ads on a campaign level
and on an ad group
level we're now going to look at our
next demo where we're going to look at
targeting and also where we're going to
look at how to create an
ad so as we shift Focus the spotlight
turns now to defining and refining your
target
audience and particular particularly
this will be important when you set up a
display campaign and when you go into
the campaign settings for the display
and you follow the menu down here you
get to the targeting option and that is
the first place where you can specify
your the which people you target with
your display ads so this is where you
can identify demographics interests and
behavior
that resonate with your brand so this
ensures if you set that that your ads
are displayed to those people that are
most likely to engage with your Brands
so navigating through this audience
setting is not about casting a wide net
it is about Precision about reaching the
right people at the right time so let's
click on the targeting and you see here
that you hone in on various areas you
can hone in on audience segments
demographics keywords topics and
placement and here while you're going
through these targeting options you can
keep track of your um estimated number
of Impressions and your estimated
performance for your ads so exploring
this array of audio targeting options
audience targeting options is about
tailoring your message to different
personalities different audiences so
look at audience
segments that is where you can select
audiences who are particularly
interested in travel or lifestyle and
hobbies and there is literally hundreds
of segments that people can um can
select yeah you can search for any
segment you can let's say here let's do
um train and
enthusiasts just taking a random topic
yeah let's see what comes up and here is
train
information train hobby traveling by
train um yeah so everything to do with
trains that you can pick here you can
even probably take miniature trains so
you can Target those people very
specifically that ensures that your ad
is not visible but also relev
to specific segments of your target
audience so that is through the audience
segments and again if you pick one so
say um train information then here you
see how your weekly estimates are um are
changing yeah so you can go by selecting
you put them in your Target and then you
see how your um advertising campaign is
likely to perform so let's stay away
from the train let's go to um Adventure
travel for instance and now you get all
those people that are interested in
adventure
vacations activity
holidays Wildlife trips Etc and again
you see how your performance is set
changing so that is the audience
segments we then going to go to the next
level is demographics we're targeting
male let's say um
between 25 and 44 years with a slightly
higher higher household income let's say
the top um 21 so we're going for the the
top uh tier and again your estimates are
being
adjusted and then you can go to the next
one you can add targeting so you can
Target keywords so this is for instance
I am targeting those people that have a
specific interest in kilamanjaro for
instance and um K
lanaro yep and I can add that as a
keyword if I want and
Morocco and you see how my weekly
estimates are becoming more and more
more specific I can add keyword ideas
through from my website as well so let's
say that is done and then we can go to
the the
final uh targeting which was by topics
yeah or you can even Target by
placements so if we want Adventure
magazines yeah so Adventure magazines
you can then select those magazines or
those online Publications where your ads
will show so you can ask by default ask
Google to select this for you but if
you're very experienced in your industry
you know specific magazines where you
want to place your ad then very likely
you will find them in the list here it
takes a little while to go through this
list of thousands if not hundreds of
thousands of online Publications but
then you can really Target very specific
by magazine
while it is doing this let's go to the
optimized targeting which is on which
means Google will actually help you get
more viewable Impressions yeah find
people beyond your targeting signals so
that is what Google will help you to
fine-tune your um uh your targeting and
um give you even better results for your
campaign yes so we targeted the
adventure channels Adventure magazine so
here are 253 websites there are YouTube
channels that you can Target YouTube
videos apps and app categories where
your ad can show so this is a very good
section where you can make your ads
reach the right people so that is one
area where you can
feature um where you can be very
specific in the targeting of your ad
that is within the display campaign
settings you can also Target People
based on
behavior and one very important behavior
is um what they have done on your
website in the
past yeah and that is what we're going
to look at next as part of this audience
uh segmentation and audience t marketing
we're going to look at how can I
leverage activities from people behavior
of people for instance visiting my
website or buying a product how can I
how can I capitalize on those um on
those people and maybe put them in a
separate audience that I can then Target
with my ad this is what we call
retargeting and I can Target people with
an ad once they F fited my website for a
particular product P page for instance
and I'm sure you've experienced that
yourself that you were visiting an ad
and that you or that you were visiting a
product on a website and then you put a
product in the basket but you decide not
to buy that product and then the next
time you go on Facebook or on YouTube
you actually see a product for that ad
so that is the next section that we will
be looking at
a new feature in Google ads are
conversion
goals conversion goals help you organize
your conversion actions so that you can
more move more easily towards achieving
your advertising objectives so actions
that you want your customers to take or
conversion actions are grouped together
based on related categories to form
these conversion goals so how do you get
there you go here to goals you click on
conversions and here you have a summary
of your conversion goals for example the
purchase conversion or the Subscribe
conversion goal would automatically
contain all conversion actions from
people to subscribe to a particular form
and this simplifies your conversion
management and it improves your campaign
performance so very powerful new aspect
with within Google ads to manage your
conversions in one central place so how
do you set up a conversion you set it up
here in the new conversion
action so you can set up a conversion
action for your website for your apps or
for phone calls or you can import data
from Google or from Salesforce or other
um tools but the most important one
again is getting convert tracking setup
for your website so when you click on
that you can then put in your website
domain you can click
scan and it will then scan the website
if it's already set up to measure
conversions which basically means have
you already set up conversion tags on
your
website so Google ads can track those
web pages so you can it has been set up
so you can actually create specific
conversion actions you can do that from
website events you can also create
conversion actions manually by using
specific code so if you use transaction
specific values transaction ideas yeah
so then you can use this option but the
easiest one is to use the create
conversion action from website event
so you can actually accept suggestion
for setting up a conversion goal you can
also add a conversion goal so you can
select a category for
instance um a subscribe the event type
could be a page load on this website and
then you just click
add the URL is required for that would
be the about us yeah and then I click
add and then the the code has been the
conversion goal has been created I click
save and
continue and then it sets up this
conversion
action where of course I need to make
sure I set it up properly with a Google
tag through Google tag manager now this
section is not about teaching you how to
use Google tech manager we have a
separate video for that but I just want
to make you aware of the process of how
to do that you can also email the
instructions to your Web Master yep so
let's say if we want to email the
instruction then we'll just put in the
email address and then it's uh sent or
you can also set it up yourself and then
what you do is you get a piece of
code where you that you basically need
to to copy and that you need to paste in
the Google tag manager so you can use
the Google tag manager that's where you
use this particular piece of code you
can also install manually and here is
the piece of code that you need to
install on every page of the
website so then Google can see that that
is a tag for those specific specific
conversion goals that um Google then can
then start tracking
good you can test the installation as
well but I'll just want to make you
aware where you go to set that
up okay so those are the conversion
goals in
Google the last topic of this
demo the last topic of this demo is ADD
placements and the networks to add
networks and the actual creation of ads
this is very important it is like
choosing the St agage for your
performance and exploring the various
options including the Google search
Network the Display Network and YouTube
is vital to align your uh your ads with
your advertising of network your
advertising objectives so the
different ad options that you have they
start with the Google search Network the
Google search Network places your ads in
search engine results
that gives you visibility for your ads
when users actively search for related
content the next area is the Display
Network that showcases your ad across a
multitude of websites and apps thereby
having a big reach of your uh your ads
YouTube as a video platform offers a
very extensive advertising platform with
lots of advertising opportunities and
different um different versions of ads
and tailoring your approach to each
platform will amplify the effectiveness
of your ad strategy to make sure that
you get maximum impact on your ads now
let's go to the fun part of Google ads
and that is the actual creation of your
ads so we'll head to over to the ads we
go to the campaigns click a campaign
here is the campaign we're going to
first create a search ads which is let's
say for website
traffic we go to continue and here is
the search ad that we're going to create
we'll add our
website and we'll click
continue and we'll start a new campaign
and where we're going to is the keywords
and the ads so we have already set up
the keywords we're going now straight to
the action ual ads and this is a very
important section where you are able to
set up your Google search ads they are
based on um
the a combination of headlines up to 15
and
descriptions up to
four and a number of extensions like
site links or call out
and different other
extensions okay you can set that all up
and then Google will mix and Ma match
those different elements of your ads to
come up with the ad with the best
performance and what's really nice here
is they show you a preview of what the
ad will look like with the different
headlines and the different
descriptions and here you see your
campaign optimization score with the
weekly estimates of how many conversions
and how many what your weekly cost is
here you see your ad strength and here
you see at the moment it is poor because
I need to make the description more more
unique so you can get ideas and you'll
see that this area will become more and
more advanced and more and more driven
by artificial intelligence in the future
yeah to make sure that you get the best
ads possible for your
market so again this is a short demo I'm
not going to go into every little detail
yeah but this is where you create your
search ads so that is the first
area the second area where you create
your ads is of course for the display
campaigns so if I go back to Google
ads and I am going to create a new
campaign but now I'm going to create a
brand awareness campaign for display ads
again here I say riar
russia.com I click continue I'm going to
go start
new and here I can of course we've been
through all these settings remember the
campaign settings the budget and the
bidding and the targeting and here we go
to the ads
and here you can
specify the URL your business name you
can add up to 15 images so where you
upload an image let's say we're going to
use the image of this room and you see
here in different formats and we're
going to add this images as well so
we're going to click
save and then you can add a text you
could even add a video you can add a
headline and here you will see what the
ad will looks look
like now make sure that you have
switched off your ad blocker if you have
set up an ad blocker and because when
you have an ad blocker then this the the
the preview of the ad will not show so I
need to add the final URL I need to add
the https for this
yep so here is the final URL with the
business name and now in a bit the ad
should show up we should have the
business name two images One headline so
we'll add um welcome to Riad for
Russia and a
description book your
adventure holiday
now okay and then here you see how the
ad would look
like very simple very straightforward
but it is all about of course the
quality of the images the headlines that
you're using the description that you're
using but at least this gives you an
idea of what an ad looks like and how
you would create that within the display
um ad
category so here is a few
tips yes so add copy is very important
yeah relevant visuals and formulate
clear call to actions they are the
fundamental elements of your in of your
ads compelling ad copy is about Clarity
and enticement and about having a
concise message and be different so the
integration of the relevant visuals that
enhances the overall appeal now calls to

uh they guide users on the desired next
steps and that will drive
conversions so keep that in mind and it
all comes back to clearly defining your
objectives

like this video click the like button
below and subscribe to our um our
Network so you get access to other
videos that we will be publishing in the
near future what social media marketing
actually means
what is it yeah and we got to put this
in the context of the definition of
marketing yeah I studied Marketing in
the very early days in the 80s and um my
main sort of uh Guru in marketing was
Philip Cotler and over the years
marketing has sort of developed from
traditional marketing to online
marketing but the basic concept has not
changed if you look at the definition of
marketing it's the activity of creating
communicating delivering and exchanging
offerings that have value for
customers yeah so you supply you deliver
you exchange products or services that
have a value for your
customers so two very important
important aspects here there is value
and there is customer and that is what
we capture in the marketing concept you
put the customer at the core of what you
do yeah because when you do that you
automatically will look at what value
are we giving to the
customer yep so take social media
marketing in that context then the
second part of the social social media
marketing sort of term is the word
social media what is social media when I
explain social media I'm using the three
C's the three C's of social media
marketing and they are content the
community and
campaigns content is the fuel of your
social media content is the um the
currency of social media
if you have really good content that you
can share on the
internet yeah using various multip
multiple social media channels like
Facebook like YouTube or like video or
like Instagram or blogging you name it
yeah people will engage with your
content and then when people start
engaging with your content they may come
back for more content that you supply
and they will then become part of your
community so Community is a very
important aspect of your social media
definition with really good content you
can create
communities and then you can push that
process by running
campaigns yeah and a campaign makes it
relevant for business
because when you run a campaign you have
a goal for your campaign you have an
objective you have a start date you have
an end
date yep and that is what social media
marketing is it's all about running
campaigns to develop your communities
with really exciting
content and then you put it into the
marketing context you do that with a
customer at in the core of what you do
yes so if I then take that to a
definition of social media
marketing is very basic it says the use
of social media to develop a company's
brand increase website traffic and boost
sales that is what we call social media
marketing yeah the most important aspect
here is that you need to have an outcome
you need to have a result which is
customer
related and that is where the sales
element comes in you do this to get the
customer to do something and in the end
that is buying your product or your
service yeah so social media marketing
is not the
Tactical combination of your social
media Networks yeah to um to reach as
many people there needs to be a goal to
it and when we talk about marketing it
comes down to selling your product or
service with a
value yeah so that is the um kind of the
call to action as it were that comes out
of your social media marketing so keep
that in mind everything you do with your
social media marketing in the end comes
down to reaching your goals or achieving
your objectives of developing your
company's brand increasing website
traffic or growing your
sales now a big benefit that you're
getting these days in digital marketing
and social media marketing is
data is
intelligence is knowledge
in the early days of marketing the
biggest problem has always been how to
measure the success of your marketing
campaigns if I ran adverts in a magazine
how do I measure the effectiveness if I
do a PR campaign and uh they write about
me in the newspaper how do I measure the
effectiveness of that how can I track
that when somebody buys a product it
actually is as a result of the pr
campaign that I Ran So in the early pre-
interet days yeah we the only way to
measure customer engagement as it were
were through Loyalty cards or credit
cards yeah with a loyalty card you had
some basic customer data through credit
cards you could track transactions but
it's very difficult to relate that to
your marketing then the internet emerged
and all of a sudden I could track
traffic to my
website yeah I could see how many people
visit my website are these people that
visit my website for the first time are
they returning visitors what are the
most popular pages that they see how
long do they stay on my website and are
they actually buying my
product yeah so that was a major
advancement of marketing in the early
2000s and then when social media emerged
it all of a sudden became possible to
measure
engagement how many people are having
conversations with us I could even
measure sentiments are people positive
about my brand are they negative about
my Brands I could track the
effectiveness of my marketing
campaigns I could measure the
effectiveness of my advertising
campaigns that I ran online so today's
reality ity is that we can measure
everything we can measure clicks we can
measure transactions we can measure
engagements we can measure return on
investments yeah and we can now even
take that a step further through
artificial intelligence that we can
actually start making predictions how
people may respond to campaigns that
we're going to be running so it's a very
important aspect of your digital uh your
social media
marketing so as I mentioned earlier
social media is a completely new way for
businesses to engage with their
customers yeah you can no longer go
without it it's a new channel to Market
it is a new channel for engagement with
your customers it is a new channel to
learn it's a new channel to listen to
find out what's happening in the market
so it's now it's it's it's there in
every aspect of your business and not
only for the marketing department it's
there for the sales department it's
there for Logistics it's there for the
customer service department it's there
for the HR department using social media
for your recruitment is a very important
element of social media marketing yes so
keep that in mind that social media
marketing is no not a fat it is that
there and it's there to stay and it
touches every aspect of your
business now to summarize this there are
three areas where social media has
changed the way businesses operate first
of all there is the connection social
media is a new way to connect with your
stakeholders yeah and stakeholders in
this case can be customers they can be
prospects influencers your own employees
using social media for
internal and not only on a local scale
this happens nowadays on the global
scale the internet allows you to sell
locally to a global audience if you want
to yeah so you can you
can cover the world you can Target
specific audiences wherever they are so
the connection aspect the targeting
aspect yeah the the market where you
want to sell your product is opened up
through social media and that is a big
benefit for business the second area
where social media has changed
businesses fundamentally is in the
interaction site it's not just about
connecting with your stakeholders you
can also interact with them and they can
interact with you on their terms on
their preferred platform
and remember in social media land the
customer is in the driving seat if
you're not interacting with them on
their terms you're going to miss the
train it's not about you don't liking
Facebook or
LinkedIn yeah as long as your customers
are on Facebook you better be on
Facebook otherwise you're going to miss
the
boat yeah because if you don't interact
with them they will move on to your
competitors who are very likely engaging
withd
them yep so it's the connection aspect
it's the interaction aspect and then the
third part is the customer data aspect
all of this yeah what we talked about
can be done and you can track every
aspect of your social media marketing at
a customer level and it gives you the
key performance indicators like conver
verion ratios sales ratios customer
satisfaction ratios and ultimately
return on
investment and there are tools nowaday
that let you manage and track all these
areas in one conglomerated system yeah
HubSpot is for instance a tool that you
can use for that and they integrate all
your marketing and customer data and
campaigns in one system that that um you
can use for
that all right so without further Ado
let's start with the first strategy
which is Select platform before diving
into the diverse landscape of social
media it's crucial to carefully consider
your business schools target audience
and the content strategy choosing the
right social media platforms can
significantly impact your Brand's online
presence and overall success Begin by
utilizing single platform and as you

build business relationships so it's a
very effective app all right now now

platform for sharing video tutorials
product demos and brand storytelling so

short form video content and creative
challenges so once you have selected

map the first thing is to identify a
marketing problem so guys identifying
Market problem is a foundational step in
devising an effective social media
marketing strategy it involves a
comprehensive evaluation of various
aspects that may hinder your business
growth addressing these issues
strategically can pave the way for
successful social media campaigns
firstly consider the challenge of
inadequate brand awareness and publicity
if your target audience is not familiar
with your brand it's crucial to focus
efforts on increasingly visibility
through engaging content and targeted
campaign
next is the declining sales from
traditional Channel signals that need
shift in marketing approach Embrace
social media platforms to reach a wider
audience and explore new avenues for
sales if I talk about the third one a
decline in fresh leads also Demands a
reassessments of lead generation
strategies so that you have to utilize
social media expansive reach to attract
and convert potential customers if
Rising operating costs are affecting
profitability
social media can offer cost-effective
Marketing Solutions leveraging these
platforms can optimize resource
allocation and enhance overall
efficiency customers defection due to
poor service also highlights the
importance of using social media as a
customer service tool address concerns
promptly and showcase positive
experiences to build loyalty lastly if

engagement refine your strategy analyze
audience preferences
experiment with content formats and
encourage interaction to increase shares
and engagement by pinpointing these
challenges you can tailor your social
media efforts to address specific needs
ensuring a more targeted and impactful
marketing strategy now let us move on to
our next one which is setting up social
media marketing objectives or goals in
the realm of social media marketing
setting clear goals defining objectives
and establishing measurable metrics are
crucial components of a strategic
approach let's delve into each aspect
the first one that is coming into my
mind is goals goals are Broad and
overachieving statements that articulate
when you aim to achieve through your
social media effort for example
increasing brand awareness online this
goal provides a general direction
indicating a desire to enhance the
visibility and recognition of your brand
within the online space it sets a tone
for your social media strategy but lacks
the specificity needed for direct
measurement now let us move on to the
next one which is objectives objectives
are specific measurable and time bound
Milestone desire to achieve a broader
goal for example increase the number of
new fans on social media platforms by
20% within the next quarter or boast
post engagement by 15% over the next 6
months or achieve a 25% growth in the
web traffic from social media channels
in the next year these were the certain
examples which showcases what are your
objectives objectives break down the
broader goal into actionable and
measurable components they provide a
road map for achieving the overachieving
goal of increased brand awareness
offering clear targets and timelines the
next and the most important one is
metrics metrics are quantifiable
parameters used to measure the
performance and success of your social
media efforts for examp example the
number of new fans or followers what is
the post engagement rate or growth
percentage in the web traffic metrics
are specific data points that help
assess progress towards objectives they
provide tangible numerical evidence of a
social media performance for the goal of
increasing brand awareness the choosen
metrics should align with the defined
objectives such as tracking the increase
in followers engagement rates and
website traffic originating from social
platforms by aligning goals objectives
and metrics businesses create a
structured framework that not only
guides their social media activities but
also enables a systematic evaluation of
success or areas that may need
adjustment this disciplined approach
enhances the effectiveness of social
media marketing efforts and contributes
to the overall success of the digital
strategy now let us move on to our next
one which is very very important that is
conducting social media audit and
Analysis once you have established your
social media marketing destination it's
imperative to assess your current
position again to determine your
standing point before embarking on a
journey this evaluation process often is
concurrent with setting objectives is
analogous to recognizing that attempting
to reach the moon is futile if your
flying machine can even take off so what
are the areas where you can perform
audit and Analysis
so guys let us discuss each one of them
one by one the first one is evaluating
your current social media presence
assess the strength weaknesses
opportunities and threats which is SWAT
of your existing social media engagement
understand the current state of your
online presence to identify areas for
improvement next is analyzing
competitive strategies investigate
social media tactics and performance of
your competitors identify potential gaps
or weaknesses in their approach so that
you can capitalize on the third one is
understanding your audience and their
Journeys study your customers exploring
demographics psychographics online
behaviors and historical preferences map
out customer Journeys through stages
like awareness interest consideration
purchase retention and advocacy an
essential aspect of this phase involves
keyword research a critical exercise to
discern what your customers are actively
searching for
utilize tools like Google AdWords
Keyword Planner which facilitates this
process aiding in identifying the key
terms and phrases that align with your
audience interests and online Behavior
this is a comprehensive evaluation which
not only informs your social media
strategy but also positions you to
leverage opportunities and address
weaknesses effectively the next one is

other facet of online promotion the the
initiation of social media marketing

interface demo three is utilizing
Facebook insights for datadriven
decisions and demo four I'll share with

and how to manage your team on the
business s okay so let's get
going The Meta business Suite used to be
known as the Facebook business manager
in fact Facebook business manager is
still available um and I'll come back to
that in a minute the differences between
the meta business suet and The Meta
business manager but as launched in
2014 it now is a all encompassing tool
for advertisers marketeers business
owners um agency

I'm going to walk you through setting up
your business account and then we're

access to your advertising your pages
your teams how you can post Etc so if
you go on Facebook there are two places
the there is the Facebook business
manager and there is the meta business
suite and that is a bit
confusing so let's talk about the
difference between the two so the
Facebook business manager and The Meta
business suite are two different
applications and they serve different
purposes yeah though the Facebook
business manager is designed for
businesses that rely on Facebook for
their marketing and advertising efforts
while the The Meta business Suite is
designed for businesses that want to
manage their total online presence yeah
the meta business manager is free and it
helps you manage your Facebook page the
advertising and all your assets in one
place once you have a Facebook page bu
business page it is essential to have
met a business B manager as further
development of your Facebook and your
Instagram so the business manager allows
you to create and track your ad
campaigns that you were managing it
helps you access and control billing
settings and create custom audiences for
your ads and you have the the option to
allocate specific tasks across your team
but it's very much focused on um on
Facebook and the core functionality of
managing your Facebook page but the
business um also by the way the business
manager gives you the ability to manage
your meta pixels or your Facebook pixels
that you can use for retargeting so
everything you want to do with your
Facebook page you can do within the
Facebook business manager but Facebook
learned or meta learned that people
wanted more people wanted to manage
their Instagram do their posting do
their content calendar so they needed
more functionality and that's where
Facebook came out with the meta business
Suite that is a centralized area to
manage your Facebook your in Instagram
you're messaging in one place so you can
save time to manage your business and to
manage your connections and develop
relationships with more people so cross
functionality is one of the business s's
most appealing features so the ability
to view all your social activities at a
glance in One dashboard manage multiple
Facebook inboxes and making your
Community Management very simple to do
you can also create and schedule posts
and stories on both Facebook and
Instagram through the meta business uh
the business suite and it's also a great
tool for managing and tracking your page
insights and managing tracking trends
that can help you better understand your
audiences so in summary meta business

your face Facebook page performance
check it out on the inside in on the
inside you want to know how your ads are
performing meta insights will give you
the detail so this is basically where
you go to become a strategic
thinker armed with real time information
about your Facebook and your Instagram
presence so let's have a look at this
let's go to the
insights yeah so heading over to the
meta page so let's go to the old
tools yep and there's two different ways
of going going there you can access that
through your page or you can access it
here through your
insights and this is where you're going
to get a gold mine of
information about your presence on
Facebook yeah so and it sorts it neatly
into sections like page views followers
engagement and um your content you want
to know how many views you CAU here you
can see how many you got you want to
know how your ads are running here you
can see how they are doing you want to
know your audience you want to know more
about your followers about your
Instagram followers here is where you
can find all that information and all
that knowledge now these aren not just
numbers on the screen these numbers they
tell you what is happening and they can
help you refining your Facebook strategy
if helps you to tweak your Instagram and
your Facebook strategy and it can helps
you in checking how your audience is
responding yeah it is really good
information so take for instance
information about your audience yeah it
gives you the followers it gives you on
Facebook and Instagram you it also gives
you detail about age and gender of your
followers it gives them where are they
coming coming
from yeah the top cities or the top
countries so you can Benchmark this data
with
competitors yeah you can also look at
your content so the content is a very
important one this is probably in my
opinion one of the most important TAPS
in the uh meta insights section so this
dissects
your posts and it shows you how each of
your post is
doing when it comes to number of people
reached number of people that have seen
the post number of people that have seen
the video you can watch uh split it by
post and by stories you can split it by
let's just do photo posts no photo post
mostly were were video posts yep and you
can specify the columns here as well so
I want to see the type of
post yeah so I can then apply and it
gives you lots of information here you
see on the videos how many minutes
people viewed the post how many
Impressions that you got the reach of
the post and the most important one is
the engagement on the post and that is
this button
is the reactions likes comments and
share this is a critical column in your
Facebook in uh your Facebook insights
yeah if I order this from top
down yeah so here then I see those posts
with the highest engagement over the
last 28 days and this is where you can
learn what posts work and what posts do
not work work and that is golden
information because if you know this
post works then why not make more of
those posts so people can um so you can
get in similar engagement level and
overall it can help you in driving your
engagement
levels so very useful reports you can
see what posts are stealing the shows
what posts need a bit of tweaking
and it can help you in making sure that
you hit the right content with the right
the right people with the right content
so think about this tab the content tab
as checking what posts work and what no
posts don't work and you can use that to
optimize your posts for um in the future
so there's a lot more in here you can
get audience information here as well
and we'll talk about that in a um in a
later demo on how to develop audiences
in your Facebook your your meta
insights right let's move on let's go to
the fourth and final demo of this video
which is about collaboration and Team
Management let's go back to the meta
business Suite in this demo we'll dive
into the world of collaboration and Team
Management within your meta business
Suite So Meta business Suite is not just
an act for you it's not a solo act it is
about getting your whole marketing team
on Facebook on the meta business Suite
yep and that can help you in kind of
supercharging your uh your management of
your Facebook and your Instagram so
let's break down how you can add team
members because teamwork is like the
secret source that can really make your
better meta business Suite come to life
so it is very useful to get your team
online so it helps you keep people in
the loop you can assign specific
roles yeah so everybody knows what
they're doing what they're supposed to
be doing when they get on uh on the meta
business suite and very important even
if your page is across or if your team
is across multiple locations you can
still still work as a team in managing
your um your Facebook and your Instagram
so let's go down to the basics the first
of this is building your team so what
you're going to do you're going to move
to the business settings and here you
see
people yeah already you here see an
overview of the people that
are available on this business account
that can use and there's currently one
that is me and I've done another one
which is me on another email and the
invite has been sent but I haven't
accepted it but let's go and click an
invite let's first look here on the
people button that is basically that
leads you to this scream if I click here
on invite
people you can then go through a number
of
steps yeah so in this section you can
select people
people once you've select those people
you can assign their access you can
assign business assets to those people
you can review the invitation and then
you can send it out so let's go through
this process so we're going to enter the
email again we're going to do just
myself
[Music]
uh yep and I can get get temporary
access or for the advanced option I can
remove but I'm just doing it yeah so
this is actually quite useful temporary
access for instance if you want like an
agency you want them to have a quick
look at your Facebook uh insights for
instance you can just give them
temporary access for the day and then
you want to switch it off yeah on uh
that particular uh that particular time
frame we're not going to do that I'm
just going to click next
and then here you can specify the access
that you want to give to this person
yeah so you can give the person partial
access or you can give the person full
control so partial access is the K they
can only work on the tasks and the
business assets assigned to them basic
access yeah which was formerly the
employee role is the default access that
everyone gets when they are added okay
so that is what you can set you can
integrate with um with apps and
different in Integrations like the
Facebook pixel that people can view them
and manage them I'm not going to do this
in this case or you can give somebody
full control which is like an admin role
yeah so that would be the business admin
role and they can manage everything
including settings people tools business
asset they can delete a business account
yeah so does not include the advanced
options so you need to be careful with
this but once you give somebody full
control yep then um they are basically
an admin for that so click shared then
there you can also look at the financial
information like transactions invoices
account spent and payment methods so
that could be for your finance manager
for instance so I am just going to be
full
control yeah so I'm happy with that no
no let's not do this I am actually none
I'm just going to be a basic control and
I click next I can then assign business
assets so there is the Facebook page
there is the ad account I can assign
products I can assign the Instagram
account the Commerce account I can
assign pixels data sets so lots stuff
that I can assign here okay so the
Facebook page and the Instagram account
that's what I want this person to be
assigned I can then review business
assets not assigned sign business assets
I then here need probably need to
specify can manage the content yeah so
insights ads oh select the business
asset so the read for Russia page yep I
can then assign cont content Community
activity ads insights and leads okay
that's all I want to get and then I'll
click next and then I'm going to send an
invitation to Mark markm man.com and as
soon as I accept the
invitation I will then show up on this
list as we saw here yeah and accept it
and I am then part of the team that met
manages the um that manage the Facebook
or The Meta business suite for this
particular page right so that's a wrap
an introduction to The Meta business

Mark campman I'm your digital navigator
for this video and if you like the video

clicking below before delving into the
details let's talk about the pivotal
role of the meta business Suite it
serves as the central control hub for
businesses using Facebook and Instagram
and it's more than just a tool it
manages their entire digital presence on
Facebook and on Instagram it
consolidates all elements of your
presence into a unified dashboard

account your pages and your team
collaboration and this streamlining

focus your attention on those most
business matters that work for you best
now in the previous video we talked
about how to set up an account on The
Meta business weed and how to navigate
the dashboard and how to collaborate by
setting up other users in your account
in today's video we're going to look at
another topic and that is the topic of
how to use the meta business Suite to
create and plan your posts and your
stories
so in the demo we're going to cover the
following topics we're going to look at
how do you create a post on Facebook and
on
Instagram how do you plan your content
and how do you use the content
calendar what are the
notifications uh that you need to work
on and that you can set up and where do
you set them up in the meta business
Suite we'll look at the inbox the
messages and comments and how you can
automate responses and then finally
we'll dig a bit deeper into the stories
how can you create stories using the
meta business
Suite there are many social media
posting and planning tools like hot suet
like Soho social buffer Sprout social
they all work really well and they allow
you to schedule and manage posts on your
social media channels on Facebook on X
on Instagram and many other platforms
however there are various reasons why
you want to choose the meta business
suite for your posting over other
platforms first of all meta business
Suite is developed by meta ensuring a
seamless integration with Facebook and
Instagram and making sure that you can
leverage all the functionality in
Facebook and Instagram within your
posting in The Meta business Suite also
content published through the meta
business Suite may have a slight
advantage in the algorithmic reach on
Facebook and Instagram basically
Facebook will reward you for using meta
business s to post your content by
giving you a wider reach for your post
it ALS also gives you access to new
features and updates within Facebook
yeah and Instagram faster than other
tools like
HootSuite they offer better security
measures and compliance with platform
policies within the meta business suite
and direct access to support is
available within the meta business Suite
as well so that will expedite your
issues
resolution so Facebook the publishing
facilities within the meta business
manager they are designed specifically
for Facebook and Instagram so that makes
it much friendlier easier for you to use
than some of the other
platforms good so let's delve into the
posting and Publishing on Facebook and
Instagram let me go to the real life
dashboard so here you see the dashboard
and let me first show you how to um
create a post there are various roots
that you can use to create a post there
is here the create Post Yeah you can
also go through the planner you can go
through the content so there are various
ways that you can get into but let me
show you the create post uh the simple
approach I'm clicking here create post
and I'm then getting to the basic screen
for creating a post yep so here you see
all the elements that you need to do yep
so first of all you're going to specify
the platform that you want to post and
I've selected here Facebook and
Instagram I can then add the photo I can
use a template and here I can use
specific text then here I see the
scheduling options I can set my privacy
settings and here you see the preview
either in the Facebook feed or in the
Instagram feed so I'm going to add a
photo I can actually upload from the
desktop or add from the file manager
we'll look into the file manager in a
bit but I'm clicking upload from desktop
and then here I can go to let's say for
Russia picking this photo the photo is
now being uploaded and here I see what
the post is going to look like then here
I can add a text and I can say
winter
promotion yeah in RI for Russia I see
here how the text is being added yes so
I can completely see how the post is
being set up I can add all the stuff
that I can add on Facebook as well yep I
see the Facebook feed preview I can go
for the Instagram feed
preview I can look at the desktop and
the mobile version so it's a fully
featured um posting platform within the
meta business piece yeah so now a few um
things of course before finalizing the
post take advantage of this preview
feature in the business Suite yeah so
make sure that your visuals and your
caption displays as intended and that
there are no formatting issues so making
sure that the post looks exactly like
you want it to look and then when you're
happy with the post you click either
publish or you can say finish
later
so I can also schedule the post yes so
I'm clicking here publish
and then the post will be published this
may take a moment or you can set here
your scheduling
options yeah so you see now that the
post is
published so but I actually I'm going to
delete it in a minute because I don't
want this post to go live yeah so if I
can want to create that post I can also
say the scheduling options and I can set
a date and a time for my post okay so
that gives it to you in a
nutshell and what we're going to do now
is let's look at this file manager in a
bit more detail the file manager is a
tool that meta business Suite um has put
together to allow you to add and
organize your assets for your business
account yep assets like your photos like
your ads like videos Etc so with file
manager you can collaborate on files and
folders you can assign access to
creative assets and you can plan your
content more efficiently so you can
manage your image and video files for
use in your posts or your stories or
your videos you can upload multiple
assets at the same time for later use
you can create albums to organize and
access your creative assets and you can
share your assets with other people in
your
so how do you access the um file manager
you can go here to all
tools and then within the all tools you
see here file manager so click on that
and that takes you to your file manager
where you can create folders and where
you can add sort of creatives in your
folder so if I go to this folder and I
can uh check the folder and here you see
one of the um the assets that I've added
into this file manager clicking here I
can straightly bring it into my creative
posts yep so I can use it to create a
story or I can delete it I can look at
my folder setting yeah here you can see
which people have access to the folders
I can assign Partners to the folders I
can edit these folder the permissions so
very useful tool and particularly if you
have lots of assets for your products
then this can be a very helpful tool in
managing those
assets so that if that takes me then a
step deeper to the content Tab In The
Meta business Suite as well yeah that is
where you can find all your published
and drafts and scheduled posts including
your reals your video posts your stories
your photos and your live videos you can
see what is published what is scheduled
what is draft what is expiring what is
expired yeah you can add your reals you
can even export the data and still still
access to your create post or your
create
real here you can see the date published
of the post you can see the status of
the post if it has been boosted or not
yeah if it what's the distribution for
the Post how many you see then some some
statistics on the posts as well and
we'll dive deeper into the insights
later in the third video but here you
can already see The Impressions the
reach the players and very important the
reactions the engagement that you had on
the different posts so very useful tool
yes so you can within this tool you can
manage your post you can create posts as
well and there's also access here to
your ab tests if you want to test posts
on their uh their effectiveness you can
also within the content and I like that
you can see your feed and your grid yeah
so here you see your Facebook feed this
one is that I've just published although
I've deleted it as well but um yeah and
here you see your Instagram
feed you can see your mentions and your
tags so it's almost like managing your
feed as well and here you see your
collections within your file manager
like Facebook photos playlists and
series that you've can
created very useful tool that um you can
use to manage your content together with
the file
manager right so that concludes the
posting
element yeah let's now go into the next
level of managing your posts and that is
through the planner the planner can be
accessed by clicking the planner button
here on the menu in the metab business
Suite dashboard so if I click on the
Planner yeah you can access your kind of
your content dashboard and within this
dashboard you can have a total overview
of what you have posted and what you're
going to
post and you can see some basic
information about your different posts
as well yeah and it's a very useful
visual tool to plan your content and to
plan ahead of your content so you click
on the planner tab as I mentioned yeah
it also features this calendar that
helps you plan schedule and visualize
what count content you want to share and
when you want to share it you can also
use this calendar to coordinate your
content with holidays and special events
what is going on and you can also use it
to manage your creative access your
creative
assets yep so here you see the goals
that you can specify you can add goals
yeah so here for instance I want to
increase r reach you can specify that
for a specific period and then here you
see how you fair against reaching the
objective of the goal that you've set
there's also the moments now
unfortunately moments does not work in
most of the markets currently it's only
working in the US so here you will see
what sort of events are coming up like
holidays National events or you can
specify your own events and that's
always good with your posting of your
content because you can then relate your
content to the events that are relevant
in your
market so you can look at your content
type yeah so you can have all your
content showing in your calendar or you
can look at your stories your reals or
your ads and here you can specify set it
by week or by
month and it gives you as I said earlier
a fantastic overview of what you have
done and what you're going to do it also
and that's what I really like about it
gives you a um gives you kind of a a
library of the posts that you have done
in the
past so the content calendar yeah is
very important it's also called an edit
torial col calendar it's used by the
marketing team to plan and schedule your
content across your Facebook and your
Instagram so it serves as a road map for
your social media marketing strategy and
it makes sure that you will be
consistent and
cohesive with your
posting yeah and it's a very important
tool that marketing teams are using some
key elements of your calendar yeah it
outlines the type of content you plan to
share that's number one yeah it helps
you scheduling it includes the specific
dates and times for when your posts will
be or for when your content will be
published yeah so you can schedule it
forward as well what are the posts that
you are planning in the coming
months good content calendars have an
integration of your different social
media
channels yep so that is very useful
because then you can select and show the
post for each sort of um channel that
you're using the calendar often include
themes or topics for postings yeah so
you have a diverse range of content that
you're scheduling there's also alignment
with your campaigns in your content
calendar so it aligns with with your
broader marketing campaigns or events so
your social media efforts they're really
contributing to it to sort of achieving
your marketing objectives good content
calendars they have collaboration
features so multiple team members can
contribute or review so you can
coordinate your efforts across your
posting and by pling planning and
scheduling your content in advance yeah
it's just a matter of a efficiency it
helps streamline your content creation
and your posting process and finally a
good content like calendar helps with
the communication within your marketing
team so everybody is aware of what is
being scheduled what posts are coming
and they can plan their tasks
accordingly now that we looked at the
publishing and planning
side of your content and your posts
let's look at the
notifications a very important part of
your Facebook and Instagram presence
unfortunately metab business Suite
allows you to receive
notifications related to your Facebook
and your Instagram business accounts
whether you get those all messaging or
whether you get them on your email so
what are notifications they are kind of
alerts or messages that inform
people yeah and it's mainly you of
course and your marketing team that are
working on the meta business Suite as
well about specific activities updates
or
interactions with the meta business weed
platform so what are the features of the
notifications in the meta business Suite
so here we go into the notifications
button that we can access through the
meta business Suite menu so click on
notifications yeah so first of all you
can customize your
notifications yeah so you can customize
the notification preferences based on
your settings and your priorities you
can receive realtime updates on relevant
activities so that keeps you in the loop
and you can explore the ad Advanced
notification settings and in the
advanced notification settings you can
tailor your notifications based on
specific activities so you're getting
prompt sort of um messages about events
that are critical to your
business so here's the overview yes so
here there's no new
notifications here are the other
notifications that are coming in these
are not notifications from within your
um within your Facebook or your
Instagram here you can filter your
notifications yeah so you can have uh
set for Action needed message reminders
comments
recommendations notifications only for
Facebook or Instagram or your business
account here you can set Market read and
here you have the settings of your
notification and here you can
specify what notifications you want to
have and most notifications that will go
within your team your marketing team
will go through
email yeah so you can set notifications
for Facebook for um yeah for your page
for messages for comments for
announcements for
suggestions other Communications like
tags like shares and here are you can
set your business email notifications
for business permissions roles ad
accounts pixels and more yeah so that
goes um quite
deep so let me dig a bit deeper in the
type of notifications you can get via
your email that could be activity alerts
yes so they include alerts about
activities on your business Pages like
new likes comments
or shares there can be page insights so
users may receive notifications about
insights and analytics related to the
performance of the business page they
could be alerts on messenger
interactions yeah so if you use the
messenger for customer communication you
may receive notifications about new uh
customer messages could be um alerts or
notifications around ad cam campaign
updates so information about your ad
performance the budget charges or budget
changes or other AD campaign related
events there could be page management
alerts yeah important actions or changes
related to the management of your
business page they could be platform
announcements from
meta yeah they may use the notifications
to in uh communicate important platform
announcements updates or
changes there could be notifications
related to security and finally
notifications around events and
reminders so very useful tool to use
important to make sure that you set the
right
preferences and make sure that you check
it regularly yeah what the notifications
are that you are getting
in besides the
notifications another important area is
your
inbox and within your inbox you have
your messages you have your comments and
your automated
responses so you can access that by
clicking on the inbox in your
menu yeah and metab business Suite they
offer several
features related to this communication
and engagement within your inbox they
enable your your business to effectively
manage your communication and your
engagement on Facebook and on Instagram
so a centralized inbox is very handy
that you can have that because it
streamlines your responses and it makes
sure you and you sort of you respond
timely and
consistently with your
audience so if you look at the menu your
centralized Hub as it were this is where
you can manage your entire inbox you can
look at just the messages messenger
Instagram yeah on WhatsApp Facebook
comments Instagram
comments yep so here you see all the
messages whether it's unread if it needs
followup you can label it here is the
filters that you can specify here you
see the people that communicate at with
you then here you see the community or
the sort of the communication that is
being done so really useful if I go here
to myself yeah what you see for the
users as well that have enable that you
can see their profile details as well
and you can set a label could be like a
new customer or a prospect you can add
labels yeah so that can be like a any
sort of CRM system to manage the
communication with your prospects for
instance yes so that is the um the inbox
so and that is sort of the um the the
dashboard that you have for your inbook
box so again we'll look at your
messenger yes so that's all the private
messages that you received within your
Facebook and Instagram business account
the
comments yeah they focus on comments
that you get within your Facebook or
your Instagram business page so this is
where you can efficiently Monitor and
respond to comments so that can really
help you with developing your engagement
with your
audience so what I really like about the
inbox is that that you can also set up
automations so you can set up automated
responses to messages messages that you
received within your um within your
inbox so they can be customized and
triggered based on specific keywords
based on Greetings or specific questions
that you get and they are very useful to
provide instant replies and managing
manage your customer inquiries
efficiently so they can be
configured yeah to acknowledge a receipt
of a message or provide basic
information or guide users to relevant
sources Sant relevant resources so let's
have a look if I click on the
alterations yeah then here you see there
is basically a um a library of
automations that you can set
up and some here you can see the ones
that you have already set up and that
you have activated so for instance I
have already activated an instant reply
or I've activated identify unanswered
messages yeah my away message is not on
or I can create an Automation and then
here you see the library of kind of
templates that you can choose from you
can greet people yeah share information
organize messages send a confirmation or
followup yes
so you start with templates so it is not
a huge library of templates that you
have but at least it allows you to to
use to look at specific um sort of
common sort of scenarios that you can
can face and you can set sort of
alterations for those
right let's go back and let's go to the
final demo in this video and that is
take a bit of a deeper look into
creating
stories so stories of a very Dynamic and
engaging format for content sharing yeah
because of their temporary nature and
their interactive features and Prime
placement don't forget that yeah it
makes them a very valuable tool for
businesses that want to enhance the
engagement on their social media
presence and connect with their
audiences and make the content more
authentic and
immediate stories also help increasing
the visibilities because they appear at
the top of a user's feed so that
provides Prime real estate for
visibility and it makes it more like
that users will see your content and
engage with your
content yes so and there are lots of
Engagement opportunities as stories are
designed to be interactive with features
like polls questions quizes swipe up um
links yeah and it connects with your
audience in a much more engaging
way
so let's have a look at the stories how
you create them
yeah so here we say create
story yeah what I like about stories is
that they provide the opportunity to
share kind of raw unfiltered content to
your users so you can give your your
followers a behind the scenes look at
your business or the personal life and
makes your posts a lot of lot more
authentic yeah so you can build stronger
relations with your with your audience
there's also a thing like fomo as we
call it it's the fear of missing out
because of the temporary nature of
stories they typically last for 24 hours
it creates a sent of
urgencies yeah so you encourage users to
check your stories regularly because
they feel I don't want to miss anything
that you are um that you are posting in
your
stories it's kind of known that people
for instance on Instagram will spend
more time in the stories than in the
news
feeds yep and businesses use that they
businesses know that stories yeah their
algorithm they often prioritize stories
making them more likely to appear on the
users uh feeds so and another big
feature of stories by the way is the
highlights feature particularly on
Instagram so you can create story
highlights which are collections of past
stories that you can feature on your
profile permanently so that is a
fantastic way to Showcase important
information or key aspects of your brand
I always say it's like the menu of your
website yeah you can actually have that
in the highlights on your
Instagram so and finally the power of
stories is also that they offer
advertising opportunities both in
Facebook and in Instagram so businesses
can use that to reach a broad audience
and promote products or
Services of course it's not as user
friendly as on the mobile but at least
you have some functionality on the the
um that you can have on the mobile as
well so add photo video we're going to
go in the same photo here
open yep so here you see the photo and
here you see how the story is being
uploaded yep so you can then add your
text as well so you can click
edit yep so here you can see I can crop
I can text or I can add stickers so
let's add text so the text will be um
I'm going to put it here yeah
so uh
winter
promotion yeah put that
here and then we have text is blue
or text is red let's make it
yellow here we go font I can
choose yep and then I can say let's
stick with that and here I can say I'm
going to add a sticker as well yes so
you have a whole library of stickers it
is again not as advanced as you have on
the mobile but at least you can do a bit
on the yeah so then I can click apply I
can add my multiple um media of
course I can schedule it I can share it
straight away or I can schedule it and I
can set my privacy settings as well so
really good functionality within the
meta business Suite so create a stories
here or create them on Facebook or
Instagram itself on the mobile but at
least you have have some functionality
on that here as well to Leverage The
Power of the
stories there are two additional items
in the old tools that you need to be
aware of that can help you with your
content creation and your content
planning if I click here on all
tools then in the menu you will see here
sound
collection sound collection is a
fantastic tool to enhance your video and
audio content which with free music or
sound effects that you can use in your
posts and it's a hidden sort of Secret
In The Meta business Suite but it gives
you a great collection of hundreds of
sound files that you can add to your
videos or your um your photos or your
your stories and there you can sort by
genre by mood by duration by vocals by
tempos you can add it to favorites there
is as you can see here over 10,
13,28 to soundtracks in there that you
can can use and they're all free of
charge so there's tracks there's sound
effects and it is very handy little tool
that you have in the meta business
manager so the other one that I want you
to be aware of if if I go back home and
back into the old tools is the
collaboration Center so here in the
manage you see your collaboration Center

structure your Partnerships with Brands

influencers so you can sort of assign uh

role of the meta business Suite the
suite serves as the central control hub
for businesses that use Facebook and

the account management of your ad

the complexity allowing you to focus on
what really matters for you and that is
your business so it's a collaborative
workspace where you can enable your
colleagues to work with you as well on
your Facebook and your Instagram and
thereby it ensures that everybody is
lined contributing collectively to
achieving your business goals so it's a
suite of tool with lots of valuable
insights like audience management me
audience engagement metrics like ad
performance yeah and it is a One-Stop
shop to manage everything you need to do
uh in managing your Facebook and your
Instagram now we've been through various
um areas of it like we looked at the
dashboard we looked at the um posting
scheduling managing your content we
found a treasure of tools and
functionalities and in today's session
we're going to look at three specific
areas we're going to dive into the
Commerce manager and we're going to be
talking about some very important
changes that meta has announced in 2023
about managing your shop we're going to
look at Facebook and Instagram ads I'm
going to show you the process of
creating an ad and how to manage your
your audiences and then we're going to
conclude the video
with demo about the Facebook and meta
insights that you can
get right let's kick off demo one the
Commerce
manager now it's important to understand
that meta has made some very important
announcements in managing your Facebook
shop in response to the current economic
downturn
meta is investing heavily in Ai and
automation tool to boost campaign
performance through shop advertising and
The Meta Advantage Suite of ads and
we'll come back to that in a little bit
yeah what that uh that means but it
means that shops
are scaling down in
functionality but promoting your product
through advertising is kind of scaling
up in um in Facebook and Instagram so
the shop ads are going to be
Consolidated Under The Meta
advantage and they facilitate easier
shop setup with inapp
checkout yeah so particularly for the
markets where you already have checkout
functionality within the Facebook app
yeah this is a very important
announcement that although the shop is
going to sort of deep be defocused the
advertising of your products is going to
get more center stage and thereby you
can promote more of your products to
your target
audiences Now new shop tools that are
coming out like ratings reviews they're
being tested and support for shops
without checkout and that's very
important to understand if you haven't
got a checkout functionality in your
shop yeah and that will be in most of
the countries except in the US and I
believe in India they support for the
shops will be
discontinued with a focus on helping the
US businesses in adding the checkouts to
their existing shops basically what meta
is doing is to optimize the whole
shopping experience in the US market and
then rolling that out across other
markets which means that some of the
shop functionality and opening up a new
shop in Facebook in other markets like
Europe and like Asia is going to be
limited so this strategic change aims to
optimize the shopping experiences
support businesses and learn from the
experiences in the US before a global
roll out so remember as I said
discontinued support for shops without
checkouts in various markets like Europe
and Asia and um for those markets you
can start focusing and focus increase
your focus on personalized ads reels and
messaging and in the US the emphasis is
on aing businesses in imp implementing
the checkout with support for shops
linking to a website until sort of first
quarter of 2024 so now this is clear
let's start with looking at the metac
Commerce manager yeah the Commerce
manager is the essential core of your
online store and it simplifies all your
store tasks with a userfriendly
interface so it enables you to manage
your products to process your orders and
deliver excellent customer service to
your customers who buy your products Now
by centralizing all e-commerce
activities meta business Commerce
manager helps you to focus on selling
your product through Facebook and
Instagram and that is of course a
fantastic opportunity that you have to
add an additional sales channel to your
um your current sales
operation so let's get into the
demo so here we see the meta business
Suite portal and to get into the
Commerce manager we go to um down here
we look at all the
tools and then we see here down here the
Commerce button we click on there and
this takes you to the Commerce manager
interface and here is your
dashboard yeah so here you see the
overview but it gives you access to
activities like adding products to your
catalog like customizing your shop or
publishing your shop it gives you shop
insights it gives you things to do on
your catalog your shops offers that you
have it gives you your your top product
so it gives you some basic insights it
gives you your top taged content and
there may be some questions you have
that you can get answers from through
the
FAQ so here you see the
important elements of managing your shop
there is your catalog that's where you
start of course yeah there is the
different shops you may have and you can
manage your shops here you can run
promotions
you can promote your product through ads
you can get insights you may have a
to-do list with things to optimize your
shop and here you go to the
settings yeah of course always important
to start with the settings and you can
have a look at the details of your shop
there's the general settings of your
shop yeah like your account info like
your email there is your localization
of your shop but you can specify the
currency the language the product
details the shipping information you
have the settings for your catalog for
your business assets for your checkout
mid method permissions very important
you can assign permissions to different
users colleagues in your organization or
your agency yeah what they can do within
the Commerce manager and then there is
your customer support where you can uh
manage your claims your um charge back
email address details shop contact
information and what have you right so
that's important to understand all the
different items that you can go through
within your cont your Commerce manager
so let's go and have a let's add a
product yeah so first you're going to do
here to your back to your home to your
overview yeah and there are various ways
that you can start adding products to
your catalog yes so you can here add
products to your catalog directly
here yep and then there is the catalog
menu here where you can set items have
product sets the data sources where are
your products coming from
yeah and then there's the um the events
as well that you can
specify okay so let's go quickly here at
one item is very important that is the
data sources basically where are your
products coming
from yeah now here you get from your
current product catalog you see here
what the status is of your Catal catalog
yeah and particularly when products come
in from a to a Commerce site like
Shopify there may be issues with various
products that you need to have a look at
but here we can click on add an item or
add an item here yes so I'm just going
to click here in general add an item and
here you see the different ways that you
can add a product it can be done through
a data feed it can be done manually or
it can be done through a
pixel yeah that you can bring it in
through a pixel from another
website so look at the
manual yeah so if I'm just going to
click here on manual then here you see
the
manual let's have a look here you see
the
manual process for adding a product
yep so you can just click a new item
well here is an item you can add an
image for your item you can add a title
the description a website link the price
for your product you can add a sales
price a Facebook product category
condition of the product availability
the status yeah so lots of stuff that
you can add here for your product and
once you've done that yeah you then just
just click upload
items so back in your dashboard you can
then click here on manage your catalog
and this is where you can see all the
products in your catalog and the status
and what the stock availability and the
price and of course if you have hundreds
of products you may want to set some
filters yeah check on attributes for
your
products yep so that is how you can add
products to your catalog and how you can
manage your catalog as well so another
way to upload your items is through a
data feed and that's a very important
one yes so you can actually just enter a
Google Sheets yep and you can download
in a template of the format for the uh
the Google Sheets that you want to
upload with your product information but
you can also so enter a URL from a
server or a hosting website and this URL
is very important when you want to work
with external e-commerce stores like for
instance
Shopify the process there is that you
would um download kind of a a Facebook
app within your Shopify account and that
sets the connection with uh between
Shopify and the Facebook uh Commerce the
Facebook shop or there may be other
e-commerce platforms where they will
actually give you a
URL and that's where you can add that
URL and that sets a link and the good
thing often about these Sol uh these
these Solutions is that there will be a
live link between your e-commerce
platform and your Facebook shop that
means when there is changes in your
product catalog in your e-commerce
platform it will automatically be
uploaded in your Facebook Commerce data
source or your Facebook Commerce catalog
right back to the overview so let's look
at how you can edit your shop now
remember the recent store changes yeah
so in most markets you can no longer
create a new shop
but you can edit an existing
shop and in some markets where there is
the inapp checkout functionality like in
the US you will still be able to create
new shops and manage your shops so let's
click here on shops and here you see the
shop that I have yep and it's um here I
can see the live
shop so here you see how the Sho the
shop looks like yep so um I can look at
the
products and I can look at the
categories I can search within the shop
here you see a version
history yep or I can close this and I
can here I can edit my shop I can edit
the layout of the shop and I can edit
the settings of the
shop so here you see the homepage P I
can look at collections I can optimize
the layout I can add banners for offers
I can add the Carousel of um of products
or collections to the Carousel and here
I can have suggestions for you yeah or a
dynamic product and that serves the
product that is relevant for the
customer yep but remember this is going
to scale down in theut future yeah you
will no longer be able to see a shop and
actually on most sort of Facebook pages
you already see that many Facebook pages
have already removed the shop because of
the limited functionalities that you
have these
days okay so that is the shop that you
can um edit in the layout and here in
the settings you can addit the
visibility the inventory the website
content the
categories yep and um again lots of
stuff that you can uh can manage
here the final thing we want to do in
the Facebook Commerce is to see how we
can do a promotion yep and if we go back
to the Commerce manager and the um the
dashbo Board of the Commerce manager we
can click here on
promotions and here you see
offers and this is where we can create
offers and we can see an overview of our
active offers our scheduled offers and
offers that expired so let's have a look
at the create offer functionality click
on this and here you can see your offer
category so I can have an amount of I
can do a sale I can do a free shipping I
can do a buy product X and get product y
here's the name of your offer and here
you can see the different if you want to
use a promo code if you don't want to
use a promo code then you tick this or
you can get a CO a code that people have
to enter and here you see the summary of
the offer so we're going to give the
name of the offer is uh spring
promotion yep no other changes it's it's
an automatic yes so no other details up
here to enter here we do the type are we
doing a percentage of or a flat amount
so let's say we're doing a
20% discount uh here you can select your
products we can say apply to the entire
shop or select some specific products
I'm going to do it for the entire shop
and then I can do include products that
already have a sales price or I canot
include
the offer applies only once per item or
I can say let's do it per order here you
see what the offer would look like yep
and here you can set the start date and
the end date of your offer if I'm happy
with all these settings I can then click
here create offer and then the offer
will be live on my
shop okay here is the summer uh sorry
here's the um the summary so the offer
is being created it gives you some some
tips so you can feature the offer in the
shop there's the offer
details yeah the discount ID the
visibility the start date we haven't
specified an end date yeah for all the
customers we can look at the customers
the product and then we see it's for all
products and then if we're happy with
this we'll just click cancel yeah so
that concludes the um the the promotion
and you see how simple it is to add a
promotion so now let's look at the last
section I want to cover in the Commerce
manager and that is the advertising that
you can schedule in the Commerce manager
now let's talk about Advantage Plus you
may have heard me talking about that
earlier in this video where it talks
about the um uh the changes that
Facebook announced in 2023 in the
Commerce manager so what are Advantage
Plus catalog ads they have been launched
on August the 15th in 2023 for
e-commerce and real retail advertisers
really helping them enhance the ad
efficiency so the Advantage Plus ads
they use Ai and machine learning where
they automatically sort of create up to
150 creative combinations of the ad so
it eliminates manual steps in the ad
creation allowing advertisers to learn
much more efficiently how which ads work
and which ads don't work and how to
maximize their budget efficiently so the
roll out of Advantage Plus provides
advertisers with new and innovative ways
to optimize campaigns and thereby you
can get fantastic new insights that can
help in develop in your advertising
strategies small businesses will also be
able to use Advantage Plus creative and
Advantage Plus audience to create ads
through their Facebook page so it's not
just through the Commerce manager but
small businesses can take advantage of
it as well so it's about creating a
personalized audience based on your page
detail and automatically adjust over
time to help you reach more and relevant
customers for your um for your ads so
here you can see the what you can do so
if you want to get started with
Advantage catalog ads so you can add
your product you can set up tracking
through a pixel and then you can create
your ad and if I click on create ad you
want to know which ad account you would
like to advertise with and then you
select the in this case the Riad for
Russia and then that takes you to your
advertising setup and this basically is
a um a subset of the uh the Facebook or
The Meta advertising platform that we
will go through in a minute once we've
concluded the Commerce manager section
yep so that's um what I want to say
about the ads and then finally let's
look at the insights so here in the
insights you can get date dat details
knowledge information about your catalog
your performance your audiences your
tagged content you can get in details
about awareness and there is the
helicopter overview of your shop
performance as well well we had very
little activity in our shop because yeah
we have a very basically no real shop in
this Facebook account but here again you
will get all the details about your shop
if you have a full operating shop within
the Commerce
manager right that concludes the
Commerce manager so now let's look at
the advertising on Instagram and
Facebook that you can manage through the
meta business suite and we'll go there
by various ways you can go into the
advertising yeah so Facebook and or meta
is very key
to get you to advertise yeah so you see
in your feeds you see posts that you can
boost um here on the um the the basic
menu you go into advertising here if you
click on the all tools you can go to ads
and these are all subsections of what
you can do in the advertising if you
really want to go to the full
advertising platform of meta you click
here on ads
manager this is the dashboard of your um
account in The Meta business Suite when
it comes to advertising you can see if
there are problems with your advertising
account there is the payment method that
you can set you can even create a
Facebook page from here you can verify
your email address and um here you have
access to the ads manager menu as well
and this is where you can have an
overview of your campaigns there is your
ads reporting very important section is
the audiences that you can create within
your ads manager and Target various
audiences with your ads there is in uh
billing and payments and your ad account
setting and here is an overview to all
the tools in the ad manager yeah
business settings SC the integration
with the Commerce Center and lots of
other stuff when it comes to your your
ads in Facebook and Instagram so let's
go to the
campaigns yeah what we want to do is to
show you the powerful features in this
demo of the ads manager when it comes to
creating an ad in Facebook and in
Instagram yeah in this video to take you
through the entire ads manager that
would be um too long we'll do a separate
video on that but here I just want to
give you a quick highlight on how easy
it is to create a new campaign so here
you see the current campaigns that I
have yep so now I'm not running any
campaigns they're all in draft mode but
here you see the typical structure for a
payperclick advertising campaign you
have
campaigns under campaigns you have ad
sets and under ad sets you have ads and
the ads they inherit the settings of the
adsets and the adsets inherit the
settings of the campaign so in the
campaigns you would set your budget in
the adsets you would set your targeting
and here are the specific ads so it's
all related to each other but it's a
multi-dimensional approach in updating
and managing your advertising campaigns
in um in meta so let's create a new
campaign and then you'll see how it
develops so we want first to look at the
campaign objective yeah so based on what
the objective is for your campaign meta
will come back to you with the ideal
settings for that particular objective
so it could be lead generation it could
be engagement it could be driving
traffic like sending people to a
destination like your website or an app
or your Instagram profile great for
getting link clicks landing page views
Etc so let's click on traffic and here
I'm going to continue so now it's going
to ask me a number of
questions yes so and I just have to go
through those questions when it comes
for the campaign when it comes to the ad
set and when it comes to the ad yeah so
we have the campaign name we have the
special ad categories if you want to do
yeah so there are special categories
that Facebook or meta wants to know
about whether it's related to credit
employment social issues elections yeah
because there may be different
requirements this was sort of set up
after the um I think it were the 2018
elections in the US and the brexit um El
sort of um uh poll uh on how advertising
was kind of abused to reach audiences
with kind of false information so now
when you do advertise for social issues
and elections or politics then there are
very specific
requirements yeah but we say there not
applicable here we go to the campaign
details yeah I can edit this the buying
type is an auction so the highest bidder
with the best quality ad will get the
best position for the ad you can do you
can change this as well uh you can do by
auction or by reservation but that is
where you will have to pay more yep and
then here's the campaign objective that
we've set at the beginning of the
process which is objective of traffic
yeah you can then set do you want to do
testing for your
ad yep and you will let Facebook create
different versions of your ad and then
it will run the different versions and
it will look at what ad will give the
best performance and do you want to make
it an advanced campaign budget yes so it
will distribute your budget across
current currently delivering ad sets to
get more results yeah but I'm going to
leave that off and I'm going to click to
next so that's my campaign settings
we're then going to the ads set and in
the ad set you're going to look at your
conversion location would that be your
website or a landing page an app on
messenger or your Instagram profile so
let's send traffic to my
website yep and then here you see your
estimated daily results how many people
you will reach and how many link clicks
I'm going to set the performance goal I
want to maximize the number of
clicks yeah what would I want to do yeah
to spend what do I want to spend
basically I can say I'm going to spend
let's say
[Music]
um1 doll or one pound in this case per
result call I can have more options here
I can say different bit strategies that
I can have yeah I can say what is the
maximum spend or what is the cost per
result call what am I prepared to spend
per kind of um click as it were yeah I'm
going to leave at that and here you have
Dynamic
creative yeah I can also leave this
blank by the way because I have my
budget setting further down below so
Dynamic creative I would just provide
creative elements such as images and
headlines and then meta will
automatically generate the perfect ad
for you a very interesting um process um
I'm going to leave it off for now
because I want to show you how an ad may
look like and how you can develop that
so my daily budget I'm setting at at 20
a day yeah here's the start date and I
can set an end date yeah so I'm going to
set the star date a bit further yeah
because I don't want it to start and
send a tar date don't need to send an
end date yep and here here is the budget
scheduling you can now schedule budget
and greases on certain days I'm not
going to do that at the start of the
campaign because I want Facebook or meta
in this case decide what works best for
me yep so and then ad scheduling I can
specify but again I'm going to run all
the ads at the same time and then here
you have your audience controls so this
is set criteria for where ADS can be
delivered so this is we have sort of
location we have age we can look at
existing custom audiences that we have
created over time I can look at audience
suggestions yep so um so that is part of
the Advantage Plus audience that I
created that I discussed with you
earlier yep and here you have your
placements and there is let meta decide
for you where your ad is going to be
shown or you can decide for manual
placement yep and then is the more
placement you select the better it is
yeah but we let the Advance Plus yeah
show more options here there's brand
safety and suitability pro for instance
prevent your ads from appearing near
content that's not conducive to your
brand for instance if you are a holiday
destination and you advertise on
Facebook you don't want to be shown um
next to an article or a a post about um
about an airline disaster yes so we're
going to hide these options manual
placements I also want you to be aware
where you can select which platforms do
you want to advertise on Facebook
Facebook's Audience Network on Instagram
or on messenger shop is no longer
available we talked about that yep and
here you go then in your ads so this is
the placement of the ads where do you
want to show your ads in the feeds in
the stories in stream ads the search
results in messages but again we'll let
Facebook or meta deite on all of this
okay so I'm going back to Advantage Plus
placement where you use Facebook's
artificial intelligence and machine
learning to give you the best placements
based on meta
understanding of your um your audience
so click next yep and then is um we're
going to go to the ad yeah so Facebook
suggest make a carousel ad yeah so here
we go into the um the ad creation so the
Facebook page that we're going to base
this on is let me have a look R for
Russia
yeah we're going to manually upload
creatives or we can get it from the
catalog yeah and here you see your
preview these are the products for my
catalog yeah so I'm just going to leave
it for this product for now yes so
you're going to look at the format I
wanted a
carousel now I have two products in my
Carousel so they should probably come up
now yeah so um so here here's the second
product no so but that's how it would
look like or you can do a collection you
can do multi Advertiser ads so and I can
um have the catalog for the ad creative
as I said could be a product set
multiple products I can make Carousel
cards as well yeah I can turn it in a
slideshow lots and lots of opportunities
and here you have your headline and your
description
yeah so the headline is carpet I can
take that out I can say um spring
promotion sort of Atlas
Mountains
carpet yeah so that should now be added
here here under the um the ad and here
you see shop now button I can add a
description that will show up at the uh
the top describe your link which would
be
fantastic handmade
carpets from the
bers in the Atlas Mountains
let's
see yeah on bigger ads you see that that
would show up here at the um the front
so yep and then you are um basically
having your primary text let me have a
look I think that is actually the text
that I wanted up
here let me have a look at
that there it is yeah so that is the
text that I wanted there
and here the call to action that would
be shop now but I have a whole range of
call to actions yeah so keep that as
shop now then where do I drive people to
I drive them to my shop and that is the
website do I want to build a URL par
parameter so I can track my campaign in
the uh in in
analytics yeah I'm not going to set it
up I can choose an app if I want to so
lots of stuff that I can do here I can
set up the tracking through the r pixel
I can select the pixel I'm not going to
go into those details and here is the
URL parameter that I want to build for
the tracking but here is the basic
version of my ad yeah and now it's a
matter of pressing publish and then the
next thing that will happen that
Facebook will look at the ad they will
evaluate the ad and once they approve
the ad yeah then the campaign will go
live yep so here's the business location
and currency I'm just clicking next let
the payment information they still need
my credit card details I don't want to
do that yeah so I'm not going to give
them the details so I want to skip that
so I'm not going to publish this
campaign for now but at least it gives
you an overview of how to create a
campaign in the flow of campaign ad set
and AD there's a lot more to it
obviously but at least this gives you a
high level overview so if that is on the
campaign setting there are two more
important areas that is your audience
creation so you can create separate
audiences that you can then add as an
audience for your ad campaign yes so if
you click create you can create a custom
audiences a lookalike audience audience
or what we say a saved audience yeah if
I click on Saved audience what you're
going to do you can specify the audience
with the name yeah and by the location
but you can then do a detail targeting
based on demographics interests or
behaviors so I can just click here let's
say somebody who is excited about travel
yeah so could be frequent Travelers yeah
and there's a whole range of things that
you can add here and in your um your
audience and you will see that it will
sort of impact your audience size as
well so you can do by
Behavior yeah or by uh by interest so um
and there's a whole sort of let's say I
want to do
California here so I can California
place people who are either interested
there yeah so I can Target by location
as well if I want so this is the really
powerful um aspect of payperclick
campaigns on meta and also on Google
yeah on the targeting so I'm going to
cancel this I can also create an
audience we say a custom audience and
this is these are audiences based on
people who have done a specific behavior
like visiting your website and this is
what we call the retargeting so Facebook
allows you to Target people who have
visited your website a particular page
which means the next day they could get
an advert of your Facebook ad of the the
product that they saw on your website so
it's all to do with the retargeting and
the pixel marketing now I'm not going to
go into that because that's beyond the
scope of this video but this is where
you would set that all
up okay and then of course within your
advertising you have your ads reporting
section as
well where you can look at the account
name yeah for the um yeah you can look
at reach Impressions frequency amount
spent and attribution setting now I have
got any campaigns running so I don't see
any details here yeah also because the
period is but let's say if we can
select um let me have a look let's say
no I haven't run any Facebook campaigns
on this campaign so I can't show you any
data but this is where you can create
your advertising reports where you can
select all these breakdowns and bring
them into your report
good that's it on the Facebook and
Instagram
ads and what we're going to do now is
move to the next demo the final demo of
this series which is everything to do
with the meta
insights to access the insights in The

get a very detailed breakdown into your

of um your page and you scroll down you
can see advertising what you've done or
what others have done and your post

post more so boost for reach takes you
straight into the advertising or create
post takes you to your uh your content
and your post and scheduling section
Within uh The Meta business Suite so
very important here and that is the most
important
report in your uh Insight which is your
audience report which is your content

so let's have a look at these three
reports and see what we get if I look at

engaging post when it comes to reactions

days yeah I can now see what has been my
most popular post over the last 90 days

interest in your business in simple
terms anyone who has shared their
contact details with you for example to
join a webinar get a free guide or
subscribe to a newsletter is considered
as a lead this is because they have
interacted with their Business website
and allowed you to reach out to them now
lead generation is the process of
attracting and collecting information
from potential customers who have shown
interest in your products or Services it
involves strategies and activities to
capture the attention of individuals who
may be interested in what your business
offers the goal is to turn these
interested individuals or leads to
customers by nuturing the relationship
and guiding through the sales funnel
lead generation methods can include
various marketing efforts the aim is to

solves for potential customers utilize
the knowledge to make content that
addresses those issues consider the
platform you're using as it impacts the
type of content you can share for
instance videos are effective on social
media but you cannot include directly
them into the mail so if your audience
is on Twitter keep in mind that long
blogs might need to be linked or
shortened always prioritize providing
value ensuring each piece of content
serves a particular purpose all right
now the next one is lead generation
database you might have the best
potential customers but it won't help
unless you manage them properly it's
essential to set up a database to keep
track of and analyze sort and group your
potential customers consider using an
automated CRM system to make this

platforms to promote affiliate links so
the platforms where you can effectively
promote your affiliate products social
social media platforms like Instagram
Facebook and Twitter are great for
reaching a broad audience additionally
content platform such as YouTube and
blogging sites allow you to create
valuable content and drive traffic to
your affiliate links don't forget about
forums like Cura where you can engage
with potential customers and provide
helpful recommendations so now let's
navigate to
Google and let's type
Q now we'll click on this
all right continue with
Google all right so here it is
Cur so here you can also promote the
affiliate links because there's a
traffic over here as well so all you
have to do is to just select the
category which you want to promote let's
just say let's just say we are promoting
a v protein brand you are promoting a v
protein brand so we'll click on this and
we can also type here best W routine Etc
and you'll get the questions similarly
like what is the best way protein brands
in India what is the best W brand for
building muscles etc etc so you can
answer these questions by clicking on
this and by answering these questions
you can also attach a link and make sure
that the information you share in Cur
will be like proper information and you

only you can recommend because then only
you'll be your audience will be attached
with you because it's a relationship
that you will build then only they'll

like multiple questions are there you
can answer each and every questions and
attach the affiliate link of that
particular product this is also a way as
you can see if you click on questions
and these are the questions some people
have used as well I think and they have
mentioned so this is a great way for
promoting or doing the affiliate
marketing you can do like this as well a
lot of people do like this another way
is through YouTube whether you're
building a website YouTube channel or
any other platform it's crucial to
acknowledge that you must reveal the use
of affiliate links the Federal Trade
Commission that is FTC mandates
transparency when earning income through
endorsements emphasizing the importance
of openly disclosing such affiliations
so as I said YouTube is a great way of
promoting or doing affiliate marketing
so let's take the same example examp
again best way protein we'll be taking
this example only so as you can see
there are multiple influencers out there
and let's just select this video so you
can promote or like do affiliate
marketing in videos in your own videos
because a lot of traffic after Google
comes to YouTube and the traffic you can
navigate that
traffic yeah so you can navigate that
traffic to your affiliate link so as we
can see this guy has attached an
affiliate link and also get up to 40% on
this protein powder so you can click on
this and he can get a commission out of
it
and make sure that the product you are
promoting or doing the affiliate
marketing is the right product and then
only you can build a relationship with
your audiences so as you can see this
guy has done that so you can do that and
this guy has like 340,000 views and
let's say if he's getting 2,000 or 3,000
clicks on this protein by suggesting
them so he'll get the commission a lot
of commission from that so this is a
nice way of promoting or doing the
affiliate marketing and this is how this
is a great way in fact this is the best
way I would say to do the affiliate
marketing because it is quite easy so
he's basically navigating that views or
that traffic to the affiliate link so
this is the another best way to promote
your or do the affiliate marketing so in

business connect with customers in the
digital world where many people spend a
lot of their time they can also help
with things like search engine
optimization and Emil marketing and
creating content like videos or blog
post overall the agency's job is to help
businesses get noticed and grow their
customer base using the internet all
right so this was about what is the role
of digital marketing agency now let's
understand the services offered by
digital marketing agencies so a digital
marketing agency provide a range of
essential services to boost your online
presence and connect with customers
effectively so let's start with the
first one which is web design or website
design
so digital marketing agencies can help
create a good-look and easy to use
website for your business now at number
two we have search engine optimization
so they can make sure your website shows
up higher in Google search results so
more people can find it at number three
we have web development so this means
they can build new features for your
website or make it work better so next
service is email marketing so these
agencies help you send out emails to
your customers to let them know about
your products and special offers the
next agency would be social media
marketing so these agencies can manage
your business social media accounts and
create posts to get more people
interested in what you are selling the
next is content marketing this means
they can help you create articles videos
or other content to share online and
attract more customers then at number
seven we have payperclick management so
they can help you set up ads online so
that you own only pay when someone
clicks on them which can help bring more
people to your website these are the
main services that digital marketing
agencies offered to help businesses
promote themselves online and reach more
customers all right so these were the
services that were offered and now let's
move on to the interesting part of this
video which is how to set up a digital
marketing agency with $0 so the first
step here would be start with market
research so market research is crucial
first step for any business including a
digital marketing agency by
understanding your target audience their
needs and the demand for your services
you can tailor your offerings to meet
those needs effectively analyzing your
competitors helps you identify what
makes your agency unique and where you
can stand out in the market to analyze
your existing customer base to
understand their demographics
preferences and needs start with looking
for industry Trends to identify popular
services and emerging demands in the
market the next you can do is conduct
surveys to gather direct feedback from
potential customers about their pain
points and preferences after that you
can develop buyas Persona which are
fictional representation of Ideal
customers to better understand and cater
to the needs of your target audience
next you can do is undertake
comprehensive market research to
comprehend your target audience their
pain points and the demand for your
chosen Services next is analyze
competitors to identify Market gaps and
opportunities that can set your agency
apart in the digital marketing landscape
all right so these were the things that
you can do in market research so this
was about doing the market research Next
Step would be address legal requirements
yes making sure your digital marketing
agency follows the rules is super
important when getting started this
means officially setting up your
business by registering it and picking a
good name you have got to do things by
the book to make sure your agency stays
on the right right side of the law it's
smart to get advice from legal experts
to make sure you're following all the
local rules and also to create the
contracts with your clients taking care
of these legal things from the beginning
helps build a strong foundation for your
agency makes clients trust you and
avoids problems down the road all right
so once you're done with this then you
can go forward and building a social
media presence so yeah building a social
media presence on platforms like
Facebook and Instagram is really
important for businesses these platforms
have lots of people using them every day
so it's good way to reach potential
customers by postponing interesting and
engaging content business can get people
interested in what they have to offer
they can also use paid advertising on
these platforms to reach even more
people this can help generate leads
which means finding the potential
customers who are interested in what the
business is selling by being active on
Facebook and Instagram a business can
build community of people who like and
follow them which can lead to more sales
and stronger connection with customers
so paying attention to these platforms
and building a strong presence there can
really help the business to grow all
right so once you have started building
a social media presence then you can
start with finding a niche when you're
starting in digital marketing it's good
idea to find a specific area that you're
really good at this would be things like
social media marketing making websites
or helping business to show up in higher
Google searches by focusing on one of
these things you can become an expert in
that area and stand out from other
digital marketers for example if you're
really good at making websites you can
focus on that and become known for it
when businesses need a new website
they'll come to you because they know
you are the best at it the same goes for
the other areas like social media
marketing or helping businesses with
their Google ads all right so this was
about finding a niche now next you can
do is create a website all right so
first you can start by creating a
website for your business this is like
having an online store or office where
people can come and learn about what you
do it's a bit of having a shop on the
internet next you can create a logo of
your business a logo is like a special
picture that represents your business
you can use a free tool called canva to
make a logo that looks nice and shows
what your business is about after that
you can use a free website builder
called vix to actually make your website
vix is like a tool that helps you put
together all the parts of your website
like pictures text and buttons without
needing to know how to code by doing
these things you can have a nice looking
website with a logo that represents your
business and you can do it all for free
this can help your business look more
professional and make it easier for
people to find you online so once you
are done with creating the website then
you can attract leads with Organic
advertising so attracting leads with
Organic advertising means promoting your
business without paying for ads instead
you use things like social media making
helpful content and improving your
website so that it shows up higher in
the Google searches for example on
social media you can post interesting
things about business that people will
want to share with their friends with
content marketing you can create useful
articles or videos that people will find
their search for things related to your
business and and with SEO you can make
sure your website is set up in a way
that makes it more likely to show up
when people search for things you offer
by using these methods you can attract
people to your business without having
to spend money on ads all right so this
is how you can attract leads with
Organic advertising now next step would
be building networks so building
networks means going to events seminars
and workshops where you can meet people
who might want to use your service or
who work in the same industry as you by
doing this you can make friends with
other businesses and learn about the
newest trends in digital marketing this
can help you find new clients and also
get tips from others in the same line of
work so building network is a good way
to make connections and stay up to date
with what's happening in the digital
marketing world all right so next step
is content marketing so content
marketing is like telling a good story
to people who might be interested in
what you are selling so instead of just
saying buy this you create helpful or
interesting things like articles videos
or pictures that help people want to see
this can make people trust you more and
see you as an expert in what you do it's
like building a strong wall around your
business to protect it and make it all
stand out when you do content marketing
you're not just trying to sell something
right away you're trying to make people
interested in what you do by giving them
something valuable this can bring more
people to your business without you
having to chase after them it's like
making a magnet that pulls customers to
you instead of having to push hard to
get their attention so content marketing
is a smart way to show people that you
know your stuff and to bring more
customers to your business without being
too pushy all right now the next step is
gather feedback so Gathering feedback is
an important part of running a business
it means collecting comments reviews
from a customers to understand what they
like and what could be improved good
firms Yelp and Google my business are
all places where customers can leave
feedback about their experience with a
business good firms is a platform where
business can be reviewed and red by
their customers helping other people
decide if they want to use that business
too Yelp is a website where people can
find a review find and review local
businesses like restaurants or shops
Google my business is a tool that lets
business manage their online presence
including customer reviews by gathering
feedback on these platforms business can
learn what they are doing and where they
can make changes to better serve their
customers it's a way for business to
listen to their customers and improve
their products or Services based on what
people are saying these were the steps
to make a digital marketing agency

strucked away in a corner SEO or search
engine optimization is like putting up
bright signs and arrows that guide
people straight to your shop it helps
your website stand out in the vast
online world making it more likely for
people to find and visit it so SEO is
like the friendly guide that ensures
your website gets the attention it
deserves bringing in more visitors and
potential
customers and for doing so a tool is
very crucial and one of the best tool
out there is SEO pow suit so SEO pow
suit stand out as the best solution for
all your SEO and digital marketing
requirements it offers four powerful
tools like rank tracker website auditor
SEO spy glass and Link assistant
providing you with a complete toolkit to
boost your search engine rankings unlike
many other SEO software options SEO
powerit offers a One-Stop shop for
optimizing your online presence and
achieving better visibility on search
engines all right now the question must
arise how do I use SE power suit so for
that we will focus on four things that
is keywords on page SEO back links and
building and first we'll have to focus
on keywords for that we will be
navigating to rank tracker all right so
this is our rank tracker we'll double
click on
it so rank tracker is a valuable tool
designed to assist you in discovering
profitable keywords monitoring your own
rankings as well as those of your
competitors and conducting thorough
competitive analysis also it serves as a
comprehensive solution to enhance your
understanding of keyword and overall
market dynamics so first of all we'll
have to create a project over here so
over here we'll have to type the URL of
this website and so I will just type
here
b.com it's an e-commerce site all right
so now we'll click on next then again
we'll connect on next and here you can
enter the keywords if you want and if
you don't want then you can proceed by
clicking on
next here you can add more search in
Google Bing Yahoo ask.com I mean it's
your choice if you want to add it or not
I just don't want to add all these
Google and Yahoo are sufficient then
we'll click on
finish all right so our project is
getting ready all right so it is loaded
so first of all we'll start by
understanding the menu bar so the menu
bar is like the control center like of
rank tracker offering a set of drop down
menus that help you manage your projects
and preferences so let's understand
first so this is file so this menu
handles basic commands relating to your
project such as opening closing and
saving files it's a goto for managing
project files efficiently then there is
preferences as we can see here in
preferences uh you can set up Global
configuration for the application and
customize settings specific to each
project it's like the headquarters of
tailoring rank tracker to suit your
needs then there is window so window
this menu provides a list of supported
hot Keys like keyboard shortcuts and
allows you to quickly switch between
different modules or sections within the
application it's all about making
navigation con action more efficient so
you can also learn these shortcuts as
well then there is help so in The Help
menu you can find information about your
rank tracker uh license along with the
links to online help resources if you
ever need guidance or have questions
this is where you can find the
assistance all right then here comes the
project as you can see project this menu
is like a project management Hub it
displays a drop- down list of all the
projects currently open in rank tracker
allowing you to easily switch between
them so only one project is there so it
is showing that only now the next one is
new so the new Option lets you create a
fresh project and then open is there use
this option to load an existing project
from your hard drive or cloud storage
then save we all know save your open
project projects with this command you
can do that then close this option
allows you to exit then as you can see
check all so check all rankings in all
the open projects simultaneously with
this command it steam lines the process
of gathering information across your
various projects then you can also login
like found in the SEO pow Cloud login
area this is where you log to access
Cloud related features all right so this
was about the menu bar now coming to the
sidebar so quickly let's understand this
one so first of all there is a dashboard
as you can see project dashboard this is
your project Central Hub it provides a
visual summary of key statistics related
to your organic traffic ranking progress
and how well your competitors are doing
it serves as a quick gateway to all main
project sections then there is rank
tracking for in this module you will
find a list of keywords you're targeting
it shows their ranking history traffic
statistics keyword efficiency index Kei
keyword difficulty and other essential
data that you may need to update
regularly so it is like that all right
now as we can see next is keyword
research so here it is so here you can
explore new keyword ideas using over 20
different tools like it is in there the
module allows you to analyze and
categorize new keywords into groups and
move them to Target keyword section all
right so as you can see these are that
20 different tools the tools that we we
talking about then there is Sur analysis
that is SCP analysis this is for
in-depth keyword analysis it provides
you detailed analytical report on
websites competing with you for the same
queries then competitors research this
module enables you to research on
competitors based on domain or topic
domain strength it offers overall report
on your website's SEO strength showing
how it evolves over time then there is
reports this module is for generating
and you know delivering reports to your
clients and I think that would be
sufficient so we have already created a
project and while creating a project you
can add seed keywords that you know
describe your business or use the ones
the tool suggest then see where your
website stands for and it helps you
understand how well your site is doing
in search results so the next step would
be analyzing so first of all for
analyzing that first of all we'll have
to go to keyword research you click on
that and then ranking keyword is there
as we can see all right so now here you
can type the name of the competitor and
click search so let's just say I want to
type the name of the competitor the sold
store let's
say all right now I'll click on
search make sure the URL is
correct and it might take some time it
is fetching something it is collecting
the keywords and then it will compare
the keyword profiles all right so this
is what it is this is the result and as
we can see keywords and this is organic
traffic this is URL of the sold
store and these are the keywords as we
can see so these are basically the
keywords for which the competitors are
ranking and and access their performance
weekend you can have the option to
investigate any competitor of your
choice or rely on rank tracker to
recommend the most relevant ones within
your specific
Niche now after this you can explore
keywords with various keyword research
methods like keyword Gap search console
Keyword Planner autocomplete tools
related searches keyword combination Etc
so as we can see all these are over here
you can have a look at these and explore
these meanwhile we can explore this
keyword sandbox as you can see keyword
sandbox with the help of this we can
filter our keywords which is the next
step all right so this is keyword
sandbox now we'll utilize the metrics
provided in the module to identify and
filter potentially lucrative keywords
eliminating those unlikely to generate
relevant traffic for our website so
factors such as search volume as we can
see and keyword difficulty and
competition can guide you in selecting
Target keywords effectively so as you
can see these are the search volumes
and this is the competition competition
is high for this
keyword and keyword difficulty is also
mentioned so you can filter out the
keywords according to your choice you
can either select or stop like track
like we can see so it's your choice you
can filter out the keywords
so whichever you don't want to you can
just click on it and it will be
dragged now your keywords will appear
also in the tracked keyword so like I
have tracked this one and this one so in
track keywords I I can have a look at
these all right so this was about it
next we will go to the website auditor
so website auditor ensures your website
is optimized on the page and checks if
it functions well technically and in
terms of content
optimization so we'll open the website
auditor and then we'll type
the website that is
de.com
right we'll click
on
finish all right so as you can
see to get a good ranking on search
engines it's important to optimize your
site first of all in terms of both
technology and content we will be using
website auditor for this job but before
that let's have a look at what all
things are there so first of all we'll
explore similarly that we explored in
the previous one so this is the menu bar
and I think we have explored this and
this is the sidebar it is bit different
from that so let's explore the sidebar
so site structure we have as you can see
this section organizes all the elements
of a website including its pages and
resources
it provides like a visual map of the
site along with an audit dashboard that
accesses various Su factors so as we can
see page audit over here now the page
audit will do the page level analysis so
this was the function of page audit then
domain strength is there so this feature
offers comprehensive report on overall
strength and performance of your website
domain showcasing its growth over time
after that there is reports this module
allows users to generate and share
reports with clients it serves as a tool
to communicate the findings and insights
obtained from the analysis of the site
structure and domain strength so this
was about the sidebar now we can start
with a little demo so first we have to
create a project that we already created
and wait till the tool crawls and
collects all the pages on your website
so that we have done already now we'll
go to site audit so as you can see here
under site structure site audit now
after visiting site audit we'll address
each technical issue systematically
following the tools recommendations to
eliminate all the
discrepancies so as you can see we are
not able to see any error as you can see
error zero warning is one information is
one so there is nothing exactly to be
fixed but if there is some error or
something is there then we can easily do
that with the help of this tool all
right so next we can do is visualization
as you can see over here under site
audit you click on that now to ensure
visualization basically is used to
ensure your site is well structured the
tool transforms your website into a
visually intuitive app once generated
you can effortlessly Sport and address
like issues orphan Pages isolated
sections redirects broken links and more
so this is what it is used for on the
right side you can arrange the pages
based on the click that dep as we can
see click depth internal page rank page
views so on the right side this is the
right side and if you switch to internal
page link as you can see you'll click on
that you can see how the internal link
are spreaded like it is bit different
sorting by Page views if you
see it lets you see which pages are
visited and viewed the most and least
but we're not able to figure it out as
of now for that I think we'll be needing
a Google analytics account and we'll
need to log in with that all right so
after reviewing and addressing on page
optimization for the site let's revisit
the keywords you gathered in rant
tracker like use website auditor keyword
map as we can see keyword map for
keyword map we'll have to go over page
audit inside page audit it is keyword
map now this module automatically
identify the Pages most relevant to each
keyword
group so the program will take a few
moments to harvest all the data for your
keywords and Pages for further analysis
first of all you'll have to type the
keywords all right let's
say I want to
write
joggers
watch
printed p
shirts
shirts
sliders
and you can write as many as givers you
want
jacket
hoodies
shs all right I think that is sufficient
now now you can
also import from CSV so basically uh in
the rank tracker you can also download
and import from CSU or you can import
directly from rank tracker also now we
have wrote the keywords over here now
we'll click on create map now the
program will take few moments to harvest
all data for the keywords and the tool
automatically identifies the pages most
relevant to your keyword group or
specific keyword so this is showing only
one it should at least show five because
website auditor will suggest the top
five most fitting Pages for each keyword
of group
so we must add more keywords I
believe we can add manually or we can
just have a look at rank tracker also
like hellfire club shirt we can
see can add that
all
right all right so still it is showing
one so after finding a match as you can
see we have find the match just over
over the page and click map as you can
see we'll have to click on this or this
relevant it
is all right
so we'll have to hover over this and
we'll click on map
now with the ready keyword map ensure
your landing page is optimized for
Target keywords now we'll go to content
audit first so here we can adjust the
target settings set the default search
engine for competitor page and assign a
specific one for the current page so as
you can see they are showing the errors
and
warnings so that we can improve on it
and as we just showing make your page
meta description approximately 22 word
long so it is showing how to fix also
basically and if we will talk about
competitors we can see
Amazon and many other hm hm is there
American Giant
Nike so they have use the keywords
they're showing the meta description it
is
showing all right so now coming to the
content
editor so this is content editor
basically what it does is to start
editing an existing page you will need
to choose between the editing modes
first of all as you can see so it might
take some time when you click on that
after doing that it might take like 5 to
10 minutes after it will show this
window now you'll need to choose between
editing modes browser mode is there and
document mode is there so let's just
select browser mode and let's click on
go you can easily you know edit this
site also and properly write an SEO
optimized title so so as you can see
33.2% optimization rate is there it is
showing and other than that we can click
on
this and this is showing us manage
mapped keywords manage search engines so
manage search engines so this will
change the default search engine set a
separate search engine for the given
page this can be helpful when optimizing
for creating a regional or local page
and click manage search engines you can
also do that all right so the two top
Fields as we can see this one this one
so these two Fields will let you edit or
enter The Meta title and meta
description tags and you can see how
those fit into the intersections the
recommended number of characters based
on the best SEO practices so as you can
see 311 160 you can easily edit that and
make it SEO friendly also all your
target keywords will show up in the
mapped keywords as you can see see the
map keyword hood is
so the green here it is green so green
means okay orange if it was orange it
means almost there red as an alarming
for neglecting or stuffing so next to
each keyword as we can see you will see
the actual keyword Count versus
recommended so the recommendations are
customizable simply click on any chip to
manually change the
recommendation so you can do that then
the recommend recommended keyword
this section will list the keywords that
have been extracted from the top ranking
pages of your competitors so you can
also include these as per your
choice and then you can save in an HTML
document from here and you can reset
from here and save so once finished save
the page and upload it on your website
so now let's just go to back
links now for back links we'll have to
go to SEO spy glass it is a useful tool
for checking backlinks it helps you
gather and analyze your own backlinks as
well as those of your
competitors so it's a good tool so again
we can write the website URL so we'll
type
b.com all right now we'll click on
next Su power
suit and we can also change this as per
our
choice let's
say We'll click on so these were the
number of backlinks so I've wrote
10,000 so it is collecting backlinks as
of now please wait while SEO spy glass
collects backlink statistical data and
builds up the project okay so these are
the number of backlinks that this site
has
130,000 domains 9,622 2 and IP is
8361 all right so these is is the this
is basically the
data so search engines prioritize
websites that have backlinks from
reputable domains conversely an
abundance of backlinks from spammy sites
can negatively impact your domain's
reputation also considering this it is
advisable to access your existing
backlink profile before embarking on any
efforts to build it further so this
involves examining and evaluating all
the back links already directed to your
site so we are going to do that and SEO
spy glass is one of the best tool for
that so step one find the pages linking
to your site for that to gather all the
backlinks directed to your site you need
to initiate a new project in SEO spy
class that we already did and now we can
navigate to backlinks
profile and click on back
links all right so the tool will examine
it index and identify all the backlinks
providing a variety of useful metrics
essential for further
analysis so as we can see backlink page
domain in link rank linked page links
back so all the back link pages are
there it is also showing
130k back links all right now coming to
the linking domains so in linking
domains module you can quickly switch
between all domains new or lost
ones and additionally set the program to
show all tlds or filter out any specific
one like
doom.
in.org
g.net so like
that all right now the anchor texts so
the anchor texts module will show the
summary wiget with the total number of
unique anchors and anchor diversity
diagram and backlink distribution of
anchor type the workspace with list all
the anchor Texs associated with
backlinks in the project alongside
you'll see the states for each anchor
like link type as we can see and number
of back links you can also see
847 and linking domains Etc also
hovering over uh any cell in the back
links domains columns you'll see the
icon of expanding the list of URLs to
look through so as you can see these are
the backlink page list of
URLs all
right now let's move on to the referral
traffic and to analyze the traffic your
website is getting through the backlinks
turn to referral traffic module this is
the referral driv module until backprint
profile this is backlink profile if you
want to analyze your website you can
come here in your S Class once you click
the update traffic Button as you can see
over here update traffic
stats or this also will work no this one
only once you click on this the program
will ask you to connect your Google
analytics account and if you haven't yet
then you can enter it so this is how it
will work so once the account is
connected it will take few moments for
the program to gather the data from
Google analytics or the backlinks in the
project after the task finishes you'll
see the results in the workspace you can
then switch between views linking
domains and backlink pag
so the linking domain view will show the
overall number of referral sessions
received from each domain and the
overall bounce rate the backlink pages
view will show the more detailed data
referral session from each backlink page
and also the bounce rate for each linked
page all right now let's navigate to
backlink profile and then we'll go to
summary So within this module examiner
summary you can like including key
metrics to identify both the strengths
and weaknesses of your site now we can
peek at your competitors's backlink
profile also now is the moment to access
your backlink profile in comparison to
your competitors achieving Superior SEO
performance is crucial for securing a
higher ranking than your competitors to
do that go to domain comparison first of
all as you can
see now this is our domain now here
we'll type the competitors's domain
let's slide this out
the sold
store.com all right the spelling is
wrong the sold store it
is all right click then there is
Snitch do c.
in all
right and one more is there let's
write
mantra.com
all right now let's click
okay so once this process is finished
you'll see a complete comparison of you
and your competitors's domains as we can
see
b.com the sold store snitch doco doin
minra now you can easily compare on the
basis of different metric there are
various metrics over here and as you can
see there is a number
91% in terms of text links domain
strength 9.33 is of mintra and 7.99 of
pof.com and these are for snitch and
these are for soul store.com so you can
easily compare them on the basis of
different metrics all right now coming
to the next step which is spot the
dangerous links before progressing to
actual link building phase it's crucial
to address one final task identify and
remove potential and harmful backlinks
so for that we will go to backlink
profile then the penalty risk so
backlink profile this then we'll go to
penalty
risk all right so this is the penalty
risk it is showing 0% which is a good
thing so basically links with a penalty
risk of 70 to 100% are high risk and
should be checked right away as they
could lead to Google penalizing your
website basically links with a risk of
30 to 70% are potential harmful so it is
advisable to examine them more closely
then links with the 0 to 30% penalty
risk are considered safe and post
minimal or no risk in your link profile
all you have to do is to collect those
harmful links and get rid of them so as
you can see there are no penalty risks
so but I need to tell you how to do that
so we'll go to backlink pages and we'll
click on a particular link as you can
see so this button update penalty risk
so it will task updated backlink page
data so it will update the
penalty risk all right so this was about
SE spy class now let's do the link
building with link
assistant so this link assistant
simplifies your link building tasks it
assists in discovering numerous link
building opportunities managing Outreach
and overseeing your link building
campaign directly within the app so
first of all we'll create a project and
specify the site and backlink and Target
settings all right so as we can see
uh we can like first of all we'll type
b.com right now so as we have provided
the web address select your desired
Target country so Target entry over here
and the language also you can select
from this and other than this the apps
search engine will be tailored
automatically according to your
preferences Additionally you have the
option to include negative keywords in
the top block list so what this is
the app will analyze the backlink
profiles of potential prospects and
eliminate those containing the specified
negative keywords so if you want if you
don't want some negative keywords you
can put it here in the topic block list
and that will not be included all right
so this was it now let's create on I
repeat now let's click on
create all right so this is the layout
now so first by default this this will
include the list of top 100 backlinks or
the competitors of your domain with the
highest s link Rank and you can select
any of the six predetermined methods as
we can see six predetermined methods or
the configure customized search this one
configure a customized search using the
expert mode this is the expert mode
basically so these options enable you to
conduct a focused search based on
specific type of Link Prospect you're
seeking if you lack seed keywords you
can utilize the get keyword suggestion
feature this function automatically
identifies your top 20 ranking keywords
that generate the highest
traffic all right so now step two would
be let's say let's explore this one
guest posting top 100 blocks we'll click

search technique you can identify the
top 100 prospects ranked by organic
traffic using specific search operators
related to your seed keywords to
initiate the search input the seed
keywords here you will write down the
seat keyword so let's say I just want to
write winter
Weare all right
and you can also do the search engine
settings but I think it is fine and tags
for Future Organization and management
but I don't think I'll be doing it so
after completing the search first of all
we'll have to click on find so let's
click on
this so the these are the contact
information this is the page previews
and this is the prospect preview and
additional details are also there you
can select or unselect all the results
to be moved to the prospects like
this right so then we'll click on move
to projects on Hover move any result to
prospects to backlist or to the trash
also so let's just click on this we can
also click on remove Prospect but we are
not going to do that we'll just move to
prospects all right so these are the
prospect that you that we have moved now
that we have possess a recently compiled
list of potential links it is crucial to
access their quality and prioritize the
ones we intend to reach out to initially
we'll go to
prospects all right then we'll click on
a URL and update so here here is the
update and select contact info so as you
can see contact info we'll click on okay

factors you would like to check take
respective data by clicking on the
update button or any of the columns
header take the factors to be updated

we are diving into Wicks an incredibly
user friendly platform that allows you
to create a professional website without
needing any coding skills whether you're
starting a new business or bringing an
existing one online Wix provides all the
tools you need to build a site that
perfectly represents your brand in this
video we'll be using the example of an
online clothing store to walk you
through the entire process from starting
a new website and selecting the perfect
template to customizing your design
adding essential features like logos and
contact forms and connecting your custom
domain we'll also show you how to
preview your website on both desktop and
mobile to ensure it looks great
everywhere and finally we'll guide you
through the process of publishing your
site live so by the end of this demo
you'll see just how easy it is to bring
your online store to life with Wix no
coding required so first head over to
the Wix website and log into your
account so you can press get started and
either you can sign up with Google press
continue so first they will ask you a
few questions like who are you creating
a website for so just answer those and
press continue so here I'm creating for
myself so initially Wix will first ask
you if you want to use AI to help set up
your website but today we are planning
to do everything manually so let's
select set up without chat and now they
will ask questions about what type of
website you want to create so I want to
create an online clothing store so let's
type that in yeah and then you can type
the name of your business let's just
give XYZ collections for now XYZ
Fashions or collections Let It Be
Collections and then they will ask what
your goal is like is it to sell products
get booked online is it to host an event
so as as as an online store it's to sell
products again they will ask many
questions so just you know answer those
okay
finish so this is basically a dashboard
so we'll discuss about this later so now
first our goal is to find a template to
pick a suitable template for our website
so let's go to design site and again
here you have two options you can either
generate a design with AI or you can
customize a template so for now we are
customizing a template so let's choose
pick a template see as you can see there
are variety of templates available so
scroll through and select one that
matches your brand Style
so let's see so let's choose this
template let's go to
edit so you should choose a template
that not only looks good but it should
also fit the structure you need for your
online store so keep that in mind so now
we are in the Wix editor the main
interface where you will customize your
website so as you can see here on the
left side you have the main menu which
lets you manage your s's design add
elements and configure settings now at
the top you'll find the toolbar for
quick access like saving your design and
previewing it so the first thing you
have to do is you have to go through the
website you know you must familiarize
yourself with the interface so that it
will make the editing process much
smoother and easier for you so that's
the first thing you have to do just get
familiar with the website options so now
let's get into designing so as you can
see this is the template and the
template is divided into sections right
so here you have the header section here
you have the main body section here you
have the gallery section and then you
have the footer so each section is fully
customizable okay you even though this
is a template you can change each and
everything of it like the images you
know the text everything so this allows
you to make the site of your own so
let's start with the header first let's
just zoom in a bit Yeah so here you can
go to Quick edit to edit the header so
here you can change the background color
adjust the layout you can just a layout
and you can edit the menu so let's just
check how we can edit you can even
select images like these kind of images
for the background or you can keep it
plain according to your wish and
according to your creativity basically
okay this so this is how you can change
colors of the header now you'll also
want to manage your site pages so what
you can do is you can go to page and
menu page and menu from the left hand
menu to add delete or reorder pages okay
so currently in this template this is
the order of the template so first we
have the homepage then we have new
collections then we have collections for
women men right so if you want you can
reorder like suppose if you want the
men's section before women section what
you can do is you can just you know
slide it you can just drag it this is
all drag and drop method you can just
drag it it's that easy it's that simple
okay and even if you want you can add
items also so for example the basically
you try to keep your menu simple but
again you must have like some of the
must have categories are shop about us
and contact right so here we have shop
here we have about us but at you can see
there's no contact so what you can do is
if you want to add contact just add menu
item you can create a new page or you
can create a new section you know you
can create Dynamic pages so right now I
want to create a section now they'll ask
what do you want to link to so is it a
web address is it a document so right
now we want like if you want email for
like contact you need email and phone
number right so here you can write in
your email here you can write in your
phone number and press done now next
let's add your sto's logo so as you know
logo is very important for the brand so
now let's see how you can upload your
logo so you can delete this section if
you don't want just do um just a second
yeah do
delete now let's add elements here you
can search like here's a search bar you
can search logo custom logo yeah so
either you can upload your own logo like
if you have created a logo logo already
you can upload the images from your file
or else which also helps us to create
logos so let's add the logo first adjust
it let's see if the logo is here just a
second yes now let's go to logo design
design my logo okay now again they will
ask you questions about your business so
this is an
online clothing store yes next now they
will just ask you what VI do you want
for your logo you know what it wants to
repesent should it be modern should it
be fun should it be creative so I want
it to be creative basically and it
should be a fresh one yeah you can
choose multiple options give next and
again they will ask you what text you
want in your logo so basically I I just
want XYZ collection so I just want XYZ
so let's type that in and then you can
give your tagline if you want to or else
if you don't want to you can skip this
part now let's see what Wick suggests
the logos Wick suggests so these are the
logos that big suggests so you can you
know select whichever appeals to you for
example right now we'll just select
this let's go to customize now here
again even though they have suggested
you a logo you can again you know work
on it and make it better you can change
the color if you didn't like the color
you can change the color if you want to
you can add text to this if you want to
okay you can add shapes you can add
symbols right and even you can upload
images like inside this if you want more
images you can upload images from your
file also so for now let's just so for
now let's just save this okay yes our
logo is created of course you can make
it much better yeah so I've just told
you you can make much better logo with
this like I have just showed you the
options so go through it use your
creativity and make a better logo
because logo is very important like a
well-designed logo is key to your brand
identity so you must ensure that it's
clear and looks great on all devices now
let's customize the hero section
background so here you can again go to
Quick edit you can change the background
color I prefer to keep it plain color
which is better so let's keep it black
now this area must be very well edited
because this is a great place to
Showcase your latest products or
promotions so make sure that you use
high quality images that align with your
Brand's Aesthetics to make a strong
first impression so so you can change
these images for that you can go to
manage media so these are the images
from the template so what you can do is
you can actually delete it you know you
can select this particular image you can
delete it right so accordingly you can
delete these images and you can add a
new image from media so if you go to add
media you can you know add the your
product images from your site you can go
to upload media and from your file or
you can drag and drop from your computer
so that's how you upload your image to
the website site right now it's time to
edit the text so click on the text box
we'll just see an example click on the
text box choose edit text and we can
just update it with something like you
know summer collection out
now
[Music]
summer collection out now you can res it
to bring it to a single line yeah now
you can change the font so we had to
select it I think this is cool and again
you can make it bold you can make it
italics you can underline it you can
change the color okay let's keep it
let's keep it red so this is how you
edit the text accordingly you can edit
texts so your text should be cleared and
consign so be careful with the you know
text color you choose the text font you
choose and also the size of the text you
choose because your text will always
contain a strong call to action so it
must really appeal and also you know
draw the attention of the customers
going through your website so please
keep that in mind so now let's add new
sections to the homepage so go to add
section from the left menu and choose
from options like product Gallery
testimonials or newsletter signup so
here let's just go to testimonials for
example now you can just drag and drop
so these are the templates you can
choose from a drag and drop so you can
just drag and drop it I want it at the
end just before the fotter
yeah so it's done now again as I have
already told you how to you know chain
the images and also work on the text you
can use those and customize your
testimonial section so now let's
customize the page footer so here you
can add your stores contact information
social media links and important legal
links like terms of services and privacy
policy so you must make sure your fter
contains all the essential links and
information customers might need
including return policies and customer
service details also so now let's see
how to add contact form so customer
interaction is crucial so let's add a
contact form for that you have to go to
elements add elements you can select
contact form you can just search
here contact strips and again you can
drag it to your choosen section so
customize the fields according to your
needs such as name email and message so
adding a contact from ensur that
customers you know can easily reach to
you with questions or feedback so
consider setting up an automatic
response to acknowledge inquiries
promptly so this is how you can edit
your website in wix's website now before
going live so like now our next step is
going live so before going live you'll
want to connect a custom domain to your
site right so for that you can go to
settings and select connect domain so
you can either purchase a new domain
through Wix or connect one you already
have so having a custom domain adds
professionalism and make it easier for
customers to find you online right so
while choosing a domain choose a domain
name that reflects your brand and which
is easy to remember mostly avoid using
numbers of hyph if possible so after
connecting your domain you'll be taken
to the vix dashboard so this is your
command center where you can manage
orders track inventory and you can also
access analytics so from here you can
also update your site manage SEO and
settings and send marketing emails so

tool to refine your marketing strategies

creating a Content plan every successful

content plan this is where the magic
starts CH GPT can play a pivotal role in
helping you brainstorm and organize your
ideas efficiently imagine sitting down
to create your blog and having a clear
road map of content ideas tailored to
your Niche That's The Power of content
plan first determine the niche you're
passionate about whether it's technology
Fitness travel or any other topic once
you have identified your Niche it's time
to leverage chart GPT so as you can see
we have log in our chart GPT and you can
simply ask chat GPT to suggest blog post
ideas for your chosen topic for example
you could type uh suggest blog post
ideas for a tech blog so I'll just
simply type
here and I'll just press enter so as you
can see chart GPT has given some blog
post ideas and these are the topics we
can look into so these ideas are in just
random suggestions are the building
blocks of your content calendar with
these topics in hand you can plan out
your blog post for the upcoming months
ensuring that your content creation is
consistent and targeted the approach not
only keeps your blog organized but also
helps you stay focused on delivering
value to your audience regularly so now
that we have our content plann in place
it's time to move on to the next crucial
part of the blogging process this step
will ensure that your blog post will not
only reach your audience but also rank
highly on search engine so you can pick
any topic you want from here support
suppose my topic is cyber security
threats in 2024 all right now the next
step is keyword research in the world of
blogging keywords are like GPS for your
content they guide your readers straight
to your blog so the next step is
conducting keyword research keywords are
essential for search engine optimization
which is SEO because they help your blog
rank higher in search engine result
making it easier for your target
audience to find your content with chat
GPT the process becomes incredibly
efficient you can start by asking chat
GPT to generate a list of potential
keywords for your blog for example uh
let's type here give me short tail and
longtail keywords give me short
tail and long tail keywords for the
particular topic which you have chosen
for example I've chosen this topic which
is cyber security threats in
2024 so I'll just press enter so as you
can see chat GPT will give a list of
short tail keywords and longtail
keywords as well it's important to
validate these keywords using an SEO
tool like Google Keyword Planner so you
can validate these keywords using Google
Keyword Planner so let me show you a
quick demo on how we can search using
Google Keyword Planner so I'll just type
here Google
Keyword Planner so as you can see I'll
just simply sign in here so here this is
the interface of Google Keyword Planner
you just have to click on discover new
keywords and you can uh type anything
for example uh the topic name is cyber
security Cy security that's it and the
uh language you have selected is English
and we will click on get results so as
you can see that Google has given us a
list of all the keywords related to this
topic the broad level keywords we have
total 658 keywords ideas available you
can also add filter here and uh suppose
low range high range or exclude keywords
in my account anything you want to alter
and suppose I click your brand or
non-brand keywords suppose you want
keywords for your platform like corera
code Udi UD anything so you you can just
untick the other brands and then it will
give you the keywords related to that
particular platform and yes these are
the monthly searches and the
competition status everything you can
just simply see from here so these are
the keywords which are having monthly
searches of around 100K to 1 million all
right so you can pick any keyword from
here suppose this is cyber security I'll
just copy paste you can also downlo
download your keywords so this is how
you can search your keywords using
keyword Google Keyword Planner so we'll
go back to chat gbt as you can see these
tools will provide you the valuable data
such as search volume keyword difficulty
and competition level this ensures that
you are targeting the right keywords
that can bring substantial traffic to
your blog so by combining the power of
char GPT with reliable SEO tools you are
setting the foundation for a well
optimized blog that can rank well and
attract the right audience now let's
move on to our next step which is
analyzing content gaps now that we have
understood the content plan and how do
we do the keyword research it's time to
gain a Competitive Edge by analyzing
content Gap so content gaps are
opportunities where your competitors
might be missing out and you can step in
to provide valuable content that fills
those voids so chat GPT can assist you
in this process by helping you to
analyze what top ranking blogs are doing
and how they might be lacking so we can
just simply type a prompt here which is
analyze the content gaps suppose
analyze the
content
gaps and you can just mention the
competitor's blog post so we can simply
uh search for that keyword which we have
chosen cyber security and you can see
the first blog post which is from Cisco
what is cyber security so we'll just uh
copy this domain I mean the web address
and here we'll just copy paste and just
simply click enter so as you can see the
chgb was unable to analyze the content
Gap so we will just uh again we will
give the prompt analyze the
content just copy paste this uh post
presenter so as you can see chat GPT
will highlight the areas where you can
improve or expand your content to offer
something unique and comprehensive by
identifying these gaps you can tailor
your blog post to cover topics or angles
that others might have overlooked giving
you a distinct advantage in the crowded
blogging landscape so uh this strategy
not only enhances your content but also
position you as an authority in your
Niche attracting more readers and high
ranking on search engines so as you can
see we can we have understood this step
now it's time to move on to a fourth
step which is building topic clusters to
truly establish your blog as an
authorative source in your nishe it's
important to create topic clusters so
topic clusters are groups of related
blog post that revolve around a central
theme this strategy not only helps with
SEO but also provides your readers with
a comprehensive understanding of a
particular subject so using chart GP you
can easily build these clusters for

clusters for a blog post suppose I just
type a prompt here create topic clusters
for a Blog about cyber
security in
2024 all right so we'll just simply

robust side structure through internal
linking which helps search engine

content pieces this improves your blogs
visibility and ranking while also
guiding your readers through a logical
and informative content Journey so as

here ready you have laid the groundwork
for a powerful content strategy now it's
time to dive into the actual writing
process where chat gbt can once again be
your invaluable assistance so after
doing this uh topic cluster thing we'll
move on to our fifth step which is
outlining and writing the blog post so
the next step of our journey is creating
a well structured outline which is very
important for organizing your thoughts
and ensuring that your content flows
smoothly so we will start by asking
chart GPT to generate an outline for
your blog post you might type something
like this which is uh create an
outline for a blog post

2024 okay so as you can see it has

need to include so it will provide a
detailed structure including headings
subheadings and that you can use as a
blueprint for your post once you have
your outline ready you can ask chat GPT
to help expand each section into fully
written content for example you could
input expand the section on heading with
the keywords name of the keyword list so
suppose this is the heading all right so

section on heading name with the
keywords and you can get your keywords

ebook in many ways so in this video
Let's understand how to create ebook for
that let's move on to the browser and
understand all right so now this is our
browser now let's understand how how to
create the content of ebook using chat
gbt which is our AI tool so we'll go to
chat gbt so now here we will be writing
a prompt to write the content of ebook
now it's up to you on which content you
want to write it it can be in your
domain also and it can be something in
which you have the interest you have the
passion and you are good at it for
example let's say somebody is good at
the knowledge regarding cars or
regarding bikes or regarding anything he
must he or he must have the value to
provide to the audiences that content he
should write the ebook on for example so
let's take an example like I'm writing
an ebook on how to make money online
right so what should I write so I'll
start with writing the prompt just a
second there we
go write
and ebook
for titled
how to make money
online featuring the AI
generated images for each
chapter this
ebook will contain eight
pages and six
chapters divided
into six chapters
all right so let's have a look what we
have written way I've written is write
an ebook for people out there titled how
to make money online in which we are
featuring the AI generated images of
each chapter for each chapter so that it
will be easy for people to understand it
now this ebook will contain eight pages
so I've instructed chity to create eight
pages divided into six chapters each
chapter will be explained in humanlike
Manner and long paragraphs it should be
long paragraphs also use AI generated
images in between the chapter for the
better explanation so let's see what the
result it gives
us all
right chapter one is freelancing and we
can see it is not able to generate the
images we'll do something about it
definitely blogging and content creation
online service and market research
selling products online affiliate
marketing online tutoring and courses so
six chapters are there all right so Chad
gbt has given us all the chapters that
we have asked Chad GPT for now we wanted
the images also like AI generated images
also so let's write a prompt for it as
we are not able to see the
images so I'm writing where are the AA
generated images that I asked
for I'm not able to see those images all
right now let's see so here CH gbt is
giving us I believe it gives us
chapterwise images all right so it is
giving us chapter-wise images here is
the air generated image for chapter one
freelancing let's proceed with generated
image for the remaining chapters all
right so it is showcasing the
freelancing people are doing freelancing
and online service and market research
okay though these people are doing
online research and market research
online service and this is blogging and
content creation as we can see these all
our a generated images that we asked for
and now we can use each of these images
in between the ebooks selling products
online affiliate products and online
tutoring and courses the images what I
think the images is pretty well that I
expected now you rebook how to make
online includes a images for each
chapter all right so what we asked for
chat gbt it gave us sometimes it happens
that what you ask it doesn't give at the
first time then you then you'll have to
write the another prompt for it as we
did right now all right now the thing is
we want all these images to be inside
this one in this doc not this doc but
this what we call ebook that we have
written so let's ask Chad gbt if it can
include it in between can you include
these
images in between the
chapters above
and then show it to
me let's see if it can do that otherwise
we can also do that but let's ask chgb
first all right I don't think it is able
to do that we might have to write
another prompt for it but rather than
that let's just use this also this only
we'll
use anyways we have got the links for we
have got the photos for each chapter so
we don't need to worry about that so
without worrying about this we'll move
on to the next step which is compile all
the tables chapters and images into a
file that we want so this file can be
PDF file also can be dog file also or in
any other format so let's just
write
compile all the
tables
chapters
properly images
properly into a document
file all
right I think Chad gbt is saying I'll
convert all the images to PNG format and
then add them to the document so let's
just add another prompt let's just stop
it and just copy paste this one and
we'll be adding another prompt so that
we can tell chat gbt that use this
format in instead of that one that it is
suggesting we can write that convert the
images into a specified format like we
can write
convert the images into jpeg
format now let's
see all right so as we can see chgb has
given the answer I have compiled the
document with converted JP s is properly
integrated you can download the ebook
using the link below so you'll click on
this file to download it and as we can
see it is getting downloaded and let's
just open this
file as we go word automatically saved
images to the normal document template
do you want to load it yes let's
see okay so this is the ebook that chat
GPD has created you guys must know that
anything that we have written inside it
is not on our own Chad gyt helped us in
writing all of this content and we can
see how properly it is written the color
scheme and all and this is how to make
money online so now we can also make the
changes in between the profit of writing
the document in Word is that only we can
always convert this document into PDF by
going to various sites but let's just
create first in the document file so
that you can also do editing and changes
and if you want to add something then
also you can easily do that so that's
why we have created into the document
format so as you can see freelancing
then there is the image as we can see we
can also resize it all right as you can
see we have resized it so this way you
can also edit it and whatever you like I
mean it's up to you it's it's very
subjective to people what they want to
do for their ebook so it's up to them if
they want to add something in more
detail or they can also Showcase with
the help of an example then they can
definitely do that and after all the
editing is done then they can you know
go for the PDF format it it is very easy
to convert doc into PDF by going to
various sites so as you can see we are
resizing the images and according to me
the images are well I mean what I
expected is it is better than that and
it is also you know showcasing what we
want what we what we are explaining over
there so yeah as you can see conclusion
is also there introduction is also there
so you don't need to worry about that as
well
and another thing is let's say uh I want
to change it a bit like let's say online
service and market research is there
then there is blogging and content
creation is there but I think this
blogging and content creation content is
bit like not that explainable I want it
to elaborate more then what will I do is
simply copy paste it or you can use from
chat GPT also we have copied it and now
we'll go to chat GPT all right now
I'll write the prompt I want
you to
explain it in more
detail so
that people can
easily understand
it now I'll copy paste I'll paste the
content that I want to
more I want chity to more explain
explain it in an elaborated way so here
it is blogging apart to sharing earning
choosing your n setting up your blog
creating high quality content monetize
your blog and advertising sponsored post
everything everything there are various
points there are five points that J gbt
has WR and now what I'll do is I'll just
simply copy it let's say I've copied it
now I'll go back to the doc this is the
doc and I'm just showing the example
right
I'll just paste it now let's
see all right online
service and this is blogging and content
creation so automatically as we can see
number of points we have written and
this is the link that it has added and
basically we got the format basically
all these things are done so we don't
need to worry about that even we want to
make any changes it is very easy to do
that as we we have just saw now the next
thing that we want to focus on is the
mockup or the cover photo or the mockup
photos for that basically we want to
Market this digital product this ebook
we want to Market it so what we'll do is
we'll have to create a cover or mup so
there are many ways to do that and as we
told you that we will be creating this
free of cost how to do all these things
in free so we'll go to canva all right
now we'll write a prompt uh what prompt
should we write we write create a AI
generated uh poster image let's write
create and AI
generated
poster
image for ebook that I can use as a
cover for it
all right this is how to make money
online
so okay we don't want the entire cover
photo but yeah so
don't give
me the entire cover
photo just generate AI
generated
image images for mockup for
ebook no we already have this kind of a
thing over
here create few
more only create image and not
the
background is creating some more images
let's wait for
those give me the inside
image for the
last
photo so basically you have to
manipulate chat G2 to give you the exact
thing that you are asking for so for
that you have to write multiple times
The Prompt sometime it happens so it's
pretty normal so don't just get
frustrated with that
I think this one is better anyways it is
not getting us what we want can you
convert
this by mistake I WR something else
downloadable I want to write I think it
is converting it all right so to create
a mockup now what we'll do is we'll
basically go to the mockups here we can
see this is the template this is apps
inside apps we'll go to mockups as we
can see we'll click on this now we have
to select the mockup we want to create
so let's have a look at it so there are
pro also there are normal one also it's
up to you which which you want to
select let's select this one and let's
get started we'll select the image that
we just downloaded it so upload it I
believe this is the
image sorry this is the
image and it is
uploaded yeah but the size of the image
is bit small right so we'll have to make
it in portrait or
something let's see if something is
there code interpretor session expired I
believe we'll have to create another one
so let's say we want to download this we
have to make sure it is in the JP format
so it is downloaded now we'll go over
here and delete this one
select
upload I believe this will fit let's see
yeah it is looking bit good than the
previous one and let's see save mup so
this is how you can create a mockup for
your digital product your digital ebook
and then you can easily download it so
once you have downloaded it you can put
it into use now the next thing is how
you can Market it that is the next
challenge for that you have to go to the
free websites that can that lets you to
upload all the your ebooks and sell it
there are many websites some are paid
and some are free also but before moving
there let me tell you guys the version
of chat gbt that I'm using is chat gbt 4
you can also do the same thing with chat
gbt 3. 5 also but it doesn't give you
the feature of downloading all these
images or whatsoever you want so for
that you don't have to worry all you
have to go is to go on
canva and you click on it and now here
you can see there are many things now
the first thing you'll do is you have to
get the ebook template so you'll search
for ebook and you can select the ebook
template whatsoever you want you can
select as per your choice for example
let's see this one this one is free so
you can customize this template and then
you can copy paste from chat gbt as chat
gbt 3.5 doesn't give you the feature to
download all these things so all you
have to do is just copy all these the
all the content that we uh previously
done and just paste it over here and you
can also add page or something like that
so it is very easy you can you know edit
this so it'll be easy for you and then
you can download it so you don't have to
worry if you don't have the paid version
of chat gbt you can easily do that in
with the help of canva so you don't have
to worry about that now coming to the
part where we were explaining how to
Market it how to sell it and where to
sell it basically so for that we'll go
to a site instam Mojo So it allows you
to you know create your own digital
product and sell it free of cost so for
that we'll log in it's pretty simple and
so once we have logged in so we have to
fill up the details so basic detail it
is very easy you can easily fill up the
details as it is showing payment
collection is not enabled on your
account so I'm showing you the demo of
it so that's why I've not done that but
it is very easy or and it's free of
course so it is very easy for you guys
as well so once you have done the sign
up and all as you can see shortcuts add
a product digital file even ticket
manage store categories there are many
things not only ebooks you can Market
over here there are many things you can
do right so for that what we'll do is
we'll go to add a product digital file
so our digital product is our ebook for
that we have created a mockup that we
have downloaded it from canva this one
so now we have the this option of adding
a product so you can see I'm a coffee
like this you can do you can set the
price and you can put in the account
details so people who are interested in
can easily buy the product from you so
it is very easy and it is also Shing
physical product digital file even
tickets others so as we know in digital
file it is showing ebooks digital art
software or any file that can be
downloadable we'll click on this and
then you can easily upload the file so
once we have uploaded then we can here
add the image product image that is the
our mup that we have
curated all right so now it is done and
once you have uploaded that you can also
product video YouTube videos are only
available on the growth plan then the
title of it the description of it the
price that you want to sell it for the
fixed price and discounted price that is
optional and limit the number of
downloads per buyer so you can easily do
all these things it is very easy you
don't have to worry about that and all
these features are there then in the end
you can just Market it so using chat gbt
you can easily create money and we have
showcased this with the help of a fine
example all you have to do is to just
implement the things that I suggested
you on your own and you have to add the
account details that I can't do you have
to do it yourself on the instam Mojo
where you can freely do that it is very
easy you have to put in your account
details and that is done and for the
people who are thinking that they don't
have the paid version of chat gbt you
don't have to worry about that as I told
you using the non-paid version of chat
GT also you can do the same thing that
I've done but you can't download the
content that I did previously for that
you can just copy paste the content and
put it into the canva so canva has the
this template of ebook all you have to
do is just paste it over there and then
download it from there and I have also
shown you how to create mockups and all
so you don't have to worry all the
things are there available for you all
you have to do is just put in the work
