hey everyone welcome to yet another
exciting video from central in this
session we will be discussing about how
to create a barcode in excel but before
we begin let me tell you guys that we
have daily updates on multiple
technologies if you're a tech geek in a
continuous hunt for latest technological
trends then consider getting subscribed
to our youtube channel and don't forget
to hit that bell icon to never miss an
update from simply learn now without
further ado let's get started with our
one point agenda that is how to create a
barcode in excel
now for this let's get on to the
practical mode by starting our microsoft
excel now we're on the practical mode
that is mfxl
now you can see that we have the first
column that is a column and the first
set of that is text and all the other
cells are
numbers
but as a whole excel considers the whole
column as a general data format so why
are we discussing about this so to
create a barcode in excel you have to
make sure that all the elements in the
column are of text data type so the
first step is to convert this general
data type to
text data type so you can do that by
going into the data type and selecting
text and now all the elements in your
first column a are type text
now the next step is
to convert these elements into barcode
now for that let's create a new column
called barcode
now our new column that is barcode has
been created
now the next step would be is to check
for the barcode font so the barcode font
looks something like this
but let me remind you the barcode font
in excel is not available by default
don't worry if it's not available we can
download it from open source
so let's go back to google
so on the google you want to search
for barcode font for excel
so the one that i would recommend is
three of nine barcode font
now you can download this font by just
clicking on the download button over
here
now i've already downloaded this font on
my local system let's now try to install
that
now the 309 barcode folder will come in
the form of zip folder you have to unzip
that
and after unzipping you'll get the setup
file which looks something like this
which is three of nine new
select that and you'll be having the
installer file over here you can install
by selecting the install button over
here
so i have already installed it in my
local system so it is readily available
for me on my microsoft excel
now we might want to create the barcode
for this particular cell in a2 so let's
create that so to create a barcode we
need to write in a formula that is
equals to
double quotes
star
double quotes and
ampersand symbol address of the cell
that is a2 another ampersand symbol
again double quotes
star symbol and double quotes
so you can either use this or instead of
star you can use brackets as well
so let's try brackets
now select enter
now this will generate another type of
code in your resultant cell
now we will change the font for this
particular resultant cell and we will
get our barcode
now you can just drag all these cells so
that you can apply the formula to all
the codes and i got all the codes over
here
now select all the cells get into the
fonts and here select the barcode font
and there you go you have the barcode
for all the numbers you have in your
column a so that's how you create
barcode in excel so with that we have
come to an end of this session on
barcode in excel if you have any queries
