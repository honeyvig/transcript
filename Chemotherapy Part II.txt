and now we are going to discuss about
macro lights and aminoglycosides so
coming to the macro lights so we know
what all rocks come on the macro lights
which include erythromycin rocks a
thorough myosin clarithromycin telly
through my son and og through my cell so
other important questions which was a
stressor which of the following is an
immunosuppressant macro light so that
includes tacrolimus so tacrolimus is
acts as an immunosuppressant drug
because of which it does it is given as
a drug of choice and it is under
clinical trials for treatment of many
autoimmune diseases like pemphigus
lichen planus etc so since it's related
to oral lesions they can ask which of
the following has immunosuppressive
action which of the following macula it
has immunosuppressive action or which of
the following macro light can be given
in autoimmune diseases so which other
are under clinical trial then you have
to go for tacrolimus which is very
important okay coming to its mechanism
of action it blocks the 50's ribosomes
and it blocks a translocation or the
unusual rearrangement of the peptide
chain from the a side to P site so they
can ask whether it blocks a
transcription or a translocation they
can ask that transcription is nothing
but if this DNA is copied to make an RNA
okay
so RNA is formed from DNA that is
transcription whereas here the macro
light actually brought the translocation
not transcription okay remember that
translocation it blocks the
translocation okay the other important
questions is which of the following is
secreted by the by that is L through
myosin and which can be given as a
single dose since it has a longer plasma
half-life IG through myosin can be given
as a single dose it has almost a
half-life of 24 hours that the reason it
is given as a single dose okay next is
these macro lights actually causes
mortal and receptor agonist say
stimulate the mortal in receptors that
the reason they can cause diarrhea okay
so the adverse effects include at macro
that is mortal in receptor agonist
alergy cholestasis and reversible
ototoxicity
so these are the adverse effects of the
macro lights where as the drug of choice
or the you
this include the claw C stands for pan
droid can crawl corynebacterium and
Campylobacter L stands for lignin illa a
stands for atypical pneumonia and W is
for whooping cough or pet roses so they
can house which of the following is a
drug of choice for pet roses or which of
the following is a table of choice for
corynebacterium then you have to go for
macrolides
okay so this chart gives you the brief
description of the users the adverse
effects and the important aspects
related to macro light so have a note of
it so next coming to the amino
glycosides which includes the following
drugs that is streptomycin gentamicin
kanamycin amicus and tobramycin and
topical inclusion neomycin and Framus
Framm is sitting so the major toxic side
effects of aminoglycosides includes that
it acts on the ears and the kidneys so
amongst that ototoxic drugs amicus in
among the all the aminoglycosides amicus
if amy castle is most ototoxic or it
causes maximum hearing loss okay
we'll discuss in detail so coming to its
clinical uses so uses of aminoglycosides
make a note of this this these points
which have been given here so coming to
that gentamicin photographers in an
amicus in are actually against gram
negative organisms including Pseudomonas
but except salim nella so which of the
following drug cannot be given in
typhoid so you have to go for amino
glycosides because it doesn't act on
Salam nila so it cannot be given in
typhoid
okay and next important point is
streptomycin guy is the first sign of
drug in tuberculosis we know that the
first sign of drugs is only as a
different person poisons in a maritime
route all and streptomycin
so it includes on the first line of
treatment along with plague and
tularemia
next is a meek acid is a second line of
drug in treatment of TB and also used
for multi drug-resistant tuberculosis so
these two lines are very important and
net Limassol in electro medicine is we
can be given in serious infections
neomycin can be given topically and also
orally for gut sterilization in hepatic
encephalopathy and the very important
point is pectin or myosin which is given
as a single
in pencil an allergic patients suffering
from gonorrhea
okay so gonorrhea and also for
penicillin is producing masseria
gonorrhea single dose aminoglycoside
which can be given as a spec to no
myosin so remember these points which
were previously asked so these are the
important clinical uses of the amino
glycosides okay and tobramycin is
actually less this was a line they have
makin a note of a tenuous first Gupta
that is it is much less effective
against an internal cartel in tropical
endocarditis when compared to Gen Thomas
no streptomycin so tobramycin is less
effective so they can ask which of the
following aminoglycoside is less
effective in in tropical endocarditis
and you have to go for tobramycin okay
so make a note of the classification and
immediately next to it right the
important points related to that
particular drug okay so coming to its
toxicity has a said it is ototoxic
nephrotoxic as well as neurotoxic so it
can cause a neuromuscular blockade
that's the reason it is neurotoxic so
coming to the ototoxic the questions
which were asses which of the following
can cause major hearing loss or maximum
hearing loss then you have to go for
amicus and whereas streptomycin is most
vegetable or toxic it can cause more
vegetable or dysfunction is major with
streptomycin
whereas maximum hearing loss is with
amicus in so remember that next in
nephrotoxic also gentamicin is morse
nephrotoxic okay whereas streptomycin is
leafs nephrotoxic
so remember these points which are very
very important so they can ask which of
the following amino glycosides is more
snifter toxic which of the following is
most ultra toxic which of the following
is most vegetable or toxic then you have
to have a idea so make a note of it
okay and next is a neuromuscular
blockade because it acts inhibits
presynaptic release of the acetylcholine
and decreases the sensitivity of the
proposed and attacked the postsynaptic
receptors so that is the reason it
causes a neuromuscular blockade so
remember that so these are the important
points related to the side effects or
the toxicity of the amino glycosides
so
have a note of this these important
points okay and remember one thing
reversible ototoxicity is with macro
lights whereas irreversible or majority
is irreversible ototoxicity doto
toxicity is with aminoglycoside so you
can have a look go to toxic it's largely
irreversible so whereas reversible is
with macro lights even that is important
so not what all you feel is also
important note exactly adjacent to that
particular drug in your classification
so it will be helpful in your final
preparation ok so again now you have to
have an idea like what all act on 30 s
ribosome and what act on 50s ribosomes
so by 8:30 so at 8 P by 8:30 rupees that
is a tea that is amino glycosides and
tetracyclines acts on 30 years ibis ohms
whereas the others that is sell at 50
you can buy 830 and sell at 50 so these
act on 50s ribosomes so remember that
Steptoe Grameen sur le throw myosin the
line özil lizard and the clindamycin the
chloramphenicol act on the 50's ribosome
so by 8:30 sale at 50 remember this
which is a mnemonic for which acts and
30s and 50s ribosome so have a note of
it okay thank you students this is a
brief disc
