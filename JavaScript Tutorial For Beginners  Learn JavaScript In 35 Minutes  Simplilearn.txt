hello everyone and welcome to today's
video on JavaScript tutorials for
beginners do you know friends that
JavaScript is a versatile programming
language which is widely used in web
development for creating Dynamic and
interactive websites in this tutorial we
are going to explore the fundamental
building blogs of JavaScript including
variables objects control flow and many
more now before we move on and learn
more about it I request you guys that do

our session there is just quick info for
you guys if you want to accelerate your
career as a certified Java fullstack
developer and acquire essential industry
skills such as react angular springbot
hibernate and GSP while also mastering
MVC and web services to craftly then
simply learn has got you covered you can
join the course the course link is is
mentioned in the description box hurry
up and join now so guys let's start with
a short introduction about JavaScript
JavaScript is a versatile programming
language which is primarily used for
creating Dynamic and interactive content
on websites it was initially developed
by Netscape communication corporations
and first appeared in
1995 over the years JavaScript has
evolved into one of the most widely used
programming languages in the web
development JavaScript was created to
add interactivity functionality and
behavior to the web pages unlike HTML
which stands for hypertext markup
language and CSS which were primarily
used for structuring and styling web
content JavaScript allows developers to
create Dynamic features such as
animations interactive forms realtime
updates without requiring a page reload
now let us see what was the purpose of
using JavaScript the first one is client
side scripting one of the javascript's
key role in web development ment is
client Sid scripting this means that
JavaScript code is executed on the
user's device rather than on the server
enabling immediate feedback and
interaction with web content next one is
versatility JavaScript is not limited to
web browsers it can also be used for
server side programming languages like
nodejs mobile app development like we
use react native and ionic and also for
desktop application development like
electron and also for game development
like phaser 3G s and many more third one
is standardization JavaScript is
standardized through the EC script
specification which defines the language
syntax features and behavior this
ensures consistency across different
JavaScript implementations and version
now let us understand what is the role
of JavaScript in web development the
first one that we have all over here is
enhancing user experience JavaScript
enables developers to create Dynamic
responsive and interactive user inter
interfaces with features like form
validation client side data processing
and Dom manipulation JavaScript enhances
the overall user experience next one we
have Ajax which stands for asynchronous
JavaScript and XML JavaScript
facilitates asynchronous communication
with we servers allowing for seamless
data exchange without reloading the
entire web page this enables the
development of modern web applications
with real-time updates and smoother user
interactions third one we have all over
here is Frameworks and libraries
JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of
Frameworks and libraries like react
angular view that has streamlined the
web development by providing pre-built
component State Management Solutions and
other tools for building scalable and
maintainable web applications now you
would be wondering why JavaScript is so
popular guys JavaScript is supported by
all major web browsers making it
accessible to wide audience of
Developers and users first reason is the
community and resources JavaScript has a
large and active developers Community
contributing to its extensive
documentations tutorials forums and
open- Source projects second one we have
is job market demand with the rise of
webbased applications and increasing
demand for interactive user experiences
Proficiency in JavaScript is highly
sought after by employers across various
Industries third one we have all over
here is continuous evolution ution
JavaScript continues to evolve with
regular updates to the ECA script
specification introducing language
features enhancements which keeps it
relevant and competitive in the
everchanging landscape of web
development so guys in summary
JavaScript plays a crucial role in web
development by enabling Dynamic and
interactive user experiences and its
popularity stems from its versatility
standardization and widespread adoption
across the web development community now
let us move on and understand some of
the basics of JavaScript guys we will be
using vs code as a text editor for our
hand John so guys let's start with the
first thing that is Javascript syntax
and its Basics JavaScript syntax forms
the foundation of any JavaScript code it
is a set of rules that governs how
JavaScript programs are written and
structured here's a breakdown of the
JavaScript syntax the first one we have
is statements and semicolons JavaScript
programs consist of statements which are
individual instructions that tell the
computer what to do each statement
typically ends with a semicolon while
JavaScript allows you to Omit semicolons
in some cases due to automatic semicolon
insertion it is considered a good
practice to include them to avoid
potential issues for example if I
declare a variable xals to 5 and if I
type consol log dox so guys in this
piece of code you can see I have
inserted semicolons at each place place
next one we can see all over here is
comments guys comments are the
executable lines in your code that are
ignored by the JavaScript interpreter
they are used to provide explanations
documentation or temporarily disable the
parts of the code for testing or
debugging purposes JavaScript support
two types of comment the first one is
single line comment and second one is
multiple line commands for example let
us see something like this so you could
see this statements and semicolons which
I have written all over here this is a
single line command now let me show you
a multi-line command multi-line command
basically can span across multiple lines
such as we can see if I do something
like
this put a star okay
and closes so you can see I have
commented these part of the code which
are not going to be read by The
Interpreter so guys this is a multi-line
comment now let us move ahead and
understand the third thing that is case
sensitivity JavaScript is a case
sensitive language meaning it
distinguishes between uppercases and
lowercase letters this applies to
variables names functions keywords and
other identifiers used in the code for
example you can see all over here I have
declared a variable where my where
equals to hello then I have also
declared where myw equals to world now
if I try to do it console log myw the
output is going to be hello and
similarly if I try to do console.log myw
the output is going to be the world so
guys you can see all over here the case
sensitivity the first one the capital V
is there and in the second V is small so
the output is different the first one is
has output of hello and second as output
of world now fourth thing that is white
space and indent
guys JavaScript ignores spaces tabs and
new lines collectively which is known as
white space in most of the cases however
proper indentation and formatting
improve code readability and
maintainability developers often use
consistent indentation to visually
organize code blocks making it easier to
understand the structure of the program
for example you can see there is a if
code okay so I've used a conditional all
over here if true and if you can see I
have indented
console.log inside this something like
that we use in Python so guys this
basically improves the program
readability and maintainability now let
us move to the next part that is
identifiers guys identifiers are the
name given to variables functions labels
or objects in JavaScript they are used
to identify and reference different
elements within the code identifiers
must adhere to certain rules first like
they must begin with the letter
underscore or a dollar sign they can
contain letters digits underscores and
dollar signs they cannot be JavaScript
keywords or reserved words they cannot
contain spaces or special characters
except underscore and dollar sign so
guys you can see one example all over
here we have where my variable and then
I've declared function my function and
there's something written to be written
in a function body so this is how the
identifiers are working now let let us
understand the basics let's start with
the variables guys variables in
JavaScript are containers which are used
to store data values they play a very
crucial role in programming as they
allow developers to store manipulate and
retrieve data within their code here's
an overview of it first thing is
declaration variables in JavaScript are
declared using keywords such as where
let or const the V keyword was
traditionally used to declare variables
but has being largely replaced by let
and const especially in modern
JavaScript code if we talk about V guys
it is basically used for declaring
variables with functional or Global
scope let was introduced in es6 let
allows for Block scoped variables that
can be reassigned if I talk about const
which was also introduced in es6 const
is used to declare variables with block
scope that cannot be reassigned through
the values they referred they can still
be mutable for object and arrays for
example if I say V age equals to 25 so
guys using V I have declared this
variable next is let name equals to John
so using let I have declared this
variable now there is a constant Pi
which I have declared con pi equal to
3.14 which is basically a constant value
next one is assignment once a variable
is declared it can be assigned a value
using the assignment operator this
assigns the value on the right hand side
of the operator to the variable and on
the left hand side example if I say say
VX and x equals to 10 okay this is not
equal this is we are basically assigning
the value 10 to the variable X okay so
you might get confused in the future
that this sign equals to the equal to
sign is also standing for equality but
that's not the case it is basically
meaning that it is assigning certain
value to this variable now let us
understand the naming conventions
variables names in JavaScript should be
meaningful and descriptive they can
consist of letters digits underscores
and dollar signs however they must begin
with a letter underscore or dollar sign
and they cannot be JavaScript keywords
or reserved words for example there we
have where first name or where user age
so you can see in this way we can
declare our variable okay the first we
have used a camel case and the second
one I have used user underscore AG so in
this way you can declare clear your
variable now let us understand some of
the basic data types used in JavaScript
JavaScript is a dynamically typed
language meaning variables can hold
values of any data type common data
types includes numbers strings booleans
arrays objects null and undefined so if
you have V num equals to 10 that's
number V name equals to Alice that is a
string and if I try to do some Boolean
where a student equals to true so these
are the of the data types and very basic
data types that will be used across our
programs so the first one you can
consider it in the number the second one
is a string type and third one is a
Boolean type Boolean means it can
contain values such as true or false now
let us understand one of the very most
important part that is scope of the
variable and it is frequently Asked in
the interviews so guys variable scope
refers to the visibility or
accessibility of variables within
different parts of the program it
determines whether in your code a
variable can be used or accessed
understanding variable scope is very
very crucial for writing clean efficient
and a bug free code in JavaScript
variables can either have a local scope
or a global scope and the type of scope
depends on how and where the variable is
declared let us discuss the first one
that is the global scope variables
declared outside of any function have a
global scope they can be accessed from
anywhere within the program including
inside functions Global variables are
accessible throughout the entire script
making them available for use in any
part of the code example guys you can
see I have written something like this
where Global where I am a global
variable and then I've declared a
function with my function and I'm trying
to console log or trying to print Global
variable now in this code you can see
this is a global variable and this can
be accessed throughout the program
because it is not declared inside the
function now in the second case which is
a local scope so guys variables declared
within a function have a local scope
they are only accessible within the
function in which they are defined local
variables exist only for the duration of
functions execution and they cannot be
accessed from outside function example
like function my function where local V
I am a local variable so guys as you can
see all over here I have declared my
variable inside this function and
finally I'm trying to print this local
variable so guys as you can see all over
here inside this function we are
declaring our variable but in the case
of global we are declaring our variable
above the function not inside the
function now guys let us move on and try
to understand the blog scope so guys
blog scope was introduced in ECA script
6 such as let and const keywords which
allow variables to have a block scope
meaning they are confined to the block
of code within curly braces in which
they are declared this includes Loops
conditionals and functions variables
declared with the let and const are not
hoisted to the top of their scope like
variables are declared with VAR so guys
you can see an example I have mentioned
for the block scope so there's a
condition if true let block variable I
am a block scope variable and then I'm
trying to print it so guys in the block
scope basically I'm declaring my
variable within the curly braces okay so
for example in the case of Loops
conditionals and function so we are
basically using let keyword in this case
which denotes the block scope of this
variable now let us move on and try to
understand what is variable hoisting so
guys if I talk
about okay this is also kind of
interesting sometimes interviewers can
ask you about it so guys in JavaScript
variables declared with VAR are hoisted
on the top of their scope during their
compilation phase this means that
regardless of where the variable
declaration appears in the code
JavaScript moves it to the top of its
containing function or script however
only the Declaration is hoisted not the
initialization variables declared with
let and cons are also hoisted but they
are not initialized until their actual
declaration is encountered in the the
code so guys you should be well versed
with understanding the variable scope
which is going to help prevent naming
conflicts improving code readability and
ensuring that variables are used where
they are intended it is kind of
essential to be mindful of variable
scope when writing JavaScript code to
avoid unexpected behaviors and bugs so
guys let's start with operators and
expressions in JavaScript operators and
expressions are fundamental concepts in
JavaScript that allows developers to
perform various computations and
operations on data here's an overview of
operators and expressions in JavaScript
the first one we have is arithmetic
operators arithmetic operators are used
to perform mathematical calculations
such as addition subtraction
multiplication division and modulus for
example as we have all over here you can
see we have VX equal to 10 where y = 5
and where sum = to x + 5 now I have also
given V product X cross Y and quotient
and remainder as now if I want to print
this variable as you can see so let's
try to run the V uh say
sum and if we try to run our program
okay
we'll type node and the file name okay
so you can see it's printing two Z and
five so if I'm trying to print the
quotient quotient means X ided Y so 10
ided 5 gives 2 okay now the remainder as
we can see there will be no remainder so
the answer is coming zero now 10 + 5
which is sum it is giving 50 so guys if
want to run your Javascript file type
node and the name of your file okay now
let us try to see now let's clear our
screen
first now let us try to understand
second operator which is the comparison
operator so guys if I talk about the
comparison operators comparison
operators are used to compare two values
and return a Boolean result which means
true or false for example if you declare
two variable say V A equals to 10 and v
b equals to 5 and if I say console. log
A cross B okay which means is a is
greater than b so 10 is greater than
five so it is going to return true
similarly this statement a less than b
is going to be false the third one is a
greater than equal to B fourth is a less
than equal to B this is a equality
operator so guys as I have told you you
should always be cautious with
assignment and equality operator for
equality it gives double equal to now
this is three equal to signs and this is
equals to equal to with strict equality
okay now let us try to understand what
does it mean
let us copy this
code and if you try to run our program
we can
see so we can see we have got our output
let me Zoom it a little bit so for first
it says true second is false third is
true fourth is false okay now we are
interested to see the seventh one so
it's saying false so we can see five is
not equals to 10 okay and if I say the
strict inequality it is also going to
say that the eth one which means it's
strict equality okay so it was also
returning false all over here the last
two statement which means it is not
equal to it is returning true and a is
also not equal to B so one is a strict
in in equality and one is a lose
inequality but this is a strict one and
this is a loose one so guys this is how
the comparison operators work now let us
try to understand the third operator
that is logical operators logical
operators are used to combine and modify
the Boolean values for example the first
one that we have is an and operator so
guys it means logical and it is going to
return true if both of the operant are
true for example in this case if I say
VX equal to true and where y equals to
false and if I try to print console. log
X and Y so if both of them are true then
it's only going to return true otherwise
here the answer will be false now x or y
means you can consider it as an or
operator which is going to return true
if at least one of the operants is true
so guys where X is true and where Y is
false so one of them is true which means
X is true and here our answer will be
true
Now console. log not equals 2x which is
a logical not operator so if I tried to
print console.log not equals to X means
not equals to True negation of true is
false so here answer will be
false I hope so you would have got a
brief idea regarding the logical
operators now let us move forward and
try to understand the string
concatenation guys in JavaScript the
plus operator can also be used for
string concatenation which means joining
two or more strings together for example
we have our first variable where first
name equals to John and where last name
equals to do and if I try to concatenate
the first name plus last name which
means where first name plus last name so
it is going to return John do okay let
me try to run this code and show
you
so you can see all over here we are
getting the output John do now I hope so
you would have got an idea regarding
string cont cenation now let us move
forward and explore the next concept
which is the Turner operator so guys in
the Turner operator which means that the
condition something says like this let
me try to write the Syntax for
this so say if there is a
condition okay and if there is
expression
one and here is expression
two so guys this is a short hand of
writing an F statement for example we
can see all over here we have declared
our age as 20 and this is the variable
message now here's a condition okay so
if age is greater than equal to 18 now
if this is true it is going to print
this otherwise it is going to print this
now let us try to run this
code
so guys as you can see all over here
it's printing you are an adult which
means this statement is true what if if
I would have done something like this
so so you can see this statement is
false age is not less than 180 otherwise
it is printing this false which is you
are a minor now as you can see all over
here we have to manipulate over this
thing something like this this is an
short form of if andl statement so if
this condition is true it is going to
print this if this condition is going to
be false it is going to print this now
let us try to understand the control
flow so guys control flow refers to the
order in which statements are executed
in the program in JavaScript control
flow is managed through conditional
statements and Loops which allow
developers to control the flow of
execution based on different conditions
let us explore the key components in
control flow in JavaScript first one we
have is conditional statements so guys
conditional statements allow you to
execute block of codes based on certain
condition the most common types of
conditional statement in JavaScript are
if else if and else let us understand
the first one that is if statement so
guys it's General block of code is
written something like this if in a Clos
bracket or parenthesis we have written
condition
and inside this what is a code or block
of code to be executed is written all
over here now you can see if condition
then if this condition is true just
print this thing any condition okay now
if I talk about Els if guys so in the
case of Els if we have to use if and
else so if the condition is true means
we have written certain condition okay
if it is true then it prints this
statement otherwise if the statement
repeat otherwise if the condition is
false it is going to print this it is
very simple let me show you one of the
example now instead of doing this what
we can do all over here
is okay we have declared the variable
age okay so if age is less than 18 so we
can say something like
this okay
or
else we can
say you are
minor okay now let us try to run this
code so it says that you are minor very
simple now if this condition is true
means our age is given as 20 and this
statement shows that this is false so
our code is going to be executed for
this block which says you are minor now
I hope so you would have got an idea
regarding LF now let us try to
understand the lsf statement so guys if
there is certain statement like if
condition one okay suppose if this
condition has to be true we can execute
this else otherwise this condition
otherwise this condition so if there are
multiple else in the statements we can
use lsf okay you can do something like
this in this case
Okay say
console.log you can say are you sure
[Music]
and
okay okay now it's correct so suppose we
have declared our variable age as 20 and
we are saying if age is less than equal
to 18 then you are an adult okay now you
can ask something like this if age is
equals to 18 then you are printing are
you sure you are 18 otherwise you are a
minor so if you are multiple lse in the
program okay so we can use lsf in this
case but only thing to remember is that
using else if you have to also put
condition all over here with else there
is no need to put any condition in the
parenthesis now guys let us try to
understand the switch statement the
switch statement is used to perform
different actions based on different
conditions it evaluates an expression
and also executes the codes associated
with the first matching case for example
switch expression case value one which
says code to be executed if the
expression matches the value one
otherwise if the code to be execute it
matches this expression then you will
execute this code third one is this one
if if none of it matches then we have a
default code to be executed now in this
way we basically are designing our
switch expression let me show you an
example of the
same okay guys so you can see all over
here I have declared a variable where
day equals three and this says where day
name now we have used our expression as
day now if the case one if it is case
one we have given the day name as Monday
if there is case two we have given the
name as Tuesday and similarly for all
the seven days I have mentioned if none
of the case matches to it we have given
a invalid day now in this case I have
given day equals to three which means
that it is going to print Wednesday let
me show you this so we are going to run
this program
so say it says Wednesday similarly if I
say day as
4 so you can say it says today is
Thursday I hope so you would have got an
idea regarding switch statement now let
us move forward and try to understand
the for Loop so guys Loops are basically
used to execute a block of code
repeatedly until specific condition is
met JavaScript supports several types of
Loops example for Loop while loop and do
while loop if I talk about for Lo
basically here what it happens so for
there will be parenthesis and there will
be initialization condition which means
you can do increment or decrement for
example in this code for where I equals
to Z and I less than 5 I ++ console. log
I which means that our variable I is
initialized with zero and it is going to
go till five and it is going to
increment and print all these value
iteratively so let me copy this code and
let us try to run this program
so guys you can see all over here is
printing 0 1 2 3 and four I hope so you
would have got an idea regarding this
now let us try to understand the while
loop so guys in case of while loop we
write something like this so suppose we
have initialized our variable I and
we're going to start with a while
keyword and there will be a parenthesis
and in this parenthesis I have declared
i l than five which means that until
this condition is met it is going to
print the value of I
and after printing the value of I we are
incrementing with the increment operator
basically the output of this code and
this code is same but the way of writing
is different so please uh take a small
note on this one okay now let us try to
understand the do while loop so
similarly I have initialized a variable
I equals to Z and here is a do keyword
so what part of code we want to execute
all over here we can write it suppose I
want to print console. log I and I ++
same task we are doing in different
different manner now if while this
condition is met means if I is less than
five till this condition is meant this
piece of codes is going to get executed
so similarly this is another way of
doing the same thing now let us go to
the Breck and continue part so here you
can see all over here there is a for
Loop and I have declared a variable I
equals to Zer and I is less than five
and we are incrementing with I ++ now if
I is equals to 3 we are doing the break
part and rest we are executing this code
okay so let me show you and let's try to
run this
code so guys as you can see all over
here is printing 0 1 and two now let us
try to understand this logic one by one
so you can see all over here here
initialization has happened just like
the for Loop and I should be less than 5
and I ++ now if I value equals to three
you are going to break this piece of
code no iterations are going to perform
so till three means 0 1 and two are only
going to get printed rest of the things
are not so that is how this is working I
hope so you would have got an idea
regarding this basically Breck puts a
stoppage in your code execution so this
was your break statement now if I talk
about continue let us try to run this
first so you can see all over here now
now if I put instead of break continue
so what it's going to do it is going to
skip this section when I equals to 3 and
it is going to print all of it but in
the case of Breck after three it's not
going to perform so 0 1 2 and four are
going to get printed but in the case of
brick it is just printing 012 and it's
stopping the code so that is what a
difference between brick and continue I
hope so you would have got an idea
regarding this so guys that was all for
