passionate about making your career in
this field then make sure to check out
the link in the pin comments and
description box to find the data
analytics program that fits your
experience and areas of interest and now
let's get started with customer
analytics that dashboard using PBI so we
will be using the Amazon sales statuses
from 2023 and 2024 for this particular
dashboard using powerp so let's quickly
switch between the PowerPoint
presentation and the data set that we
are going to use today so this
particular data set is available on
kagle and it is actually the data set
between 2020 and 2021 so we carried out
a little bit of data clean process and
we enhanced the data set like removing
the blank spaces removing the blank
cells and the blank rows basically so
and after that changing the data type of
dates so you might be wondering there
might be a few discrepan in the way the
data is formatted because there are many
ways for example if I just select this
column and go back to data type and if I
go to the available dates there are many
formats so you can see year month and
date date month and year and there is an
alphabetical representation of month
right so there are many variations where
you can represent the date so we are
going to use one single format for the
entire data set so that it can be easier
for us to identify the week on week
month- on month quar on quarter and
yearly U analysis so that's the whole
point of it first point just try to
eliminate any kind of blank cells rows
or columns in your data set so that the
accuracy of the data that you are using
to perform analysis is intact and good
right so apart from that just check if
you want to eliminate any of the decimal
points just select this and here you can
see the option to element leading
decimal numbers right you can use this
option over here so there are about 2
lh86 393 rows in this particular data
set so it might take a little while to
uh reflect my actions on this particular
data set and apart from that if you
could just hover over through this part
particular dat set you have a lot of
things to deal with you have regions you
have username discount percentage and uh
you have first name last name of the
user quantity order price value so why
are we basically going through this
particular dat set is it is when you
understand it is when you can quantify
what's happening with your dat set
that's when you can plan out what kind
of analysis you want to perform right
let's say you did not get any kind of
prerequisites from your manager you just
have the DS head and you need to perform
the exact uh you know analysis which
could benefit your organization so they
also want some insights that they can
make out some decisions out of it right
some business decisions so in that
situation you just have to go through
the data set once and do the data
cleaning process and then understand
what exactly has been mentioned in this
particular data set and what kind of uh
insights you can extract out of this
data set and you can proceed with that
so basically we have quantity ordered
price value and uh total apart from that
you have category you have uh different
payment methods you have uh the year you
have the dates and uh you so when you
have dates you can also create some
trend lines out of it and apart from
that um let's say you have zip codes
region right so you can find out region
by sales and a few more things what you
can basically do out of it right so
having the data set understood let's go
back to powerbi so this is our powerbi
platform so basically just select this
particular Excel work option and import
the data I've done it basically here you
have it so we have the age category City
Country everything presented away here
now let's quickly create
the visualizations using this particular
J so I would firstly go with u a bar
graph okay let me choose this uh bar
graph right over here and uh let me
create gender byse sales let's let's
have this
gender
here so we should be having something
called as a price or a sale so we have
price over here you can quickly draw and
drag this and drop it on the
x-axis okay we y axis and uh gender on
the
xaxis so we don't want this filter over
here you can eliminate
this so now you have um gender wise
sales right now next let's use a pie
chart now you can find out the region by
sales quickly add the region
into
Legends
here you have the region by sales so you
have Midwest Northeast South and
southwest regions so these are the sale
of number uh line graph which can help
us to to okay so just click on the
canvas and then double click for your
draft
sheet now let's use the audit
date and drop it onto
xaxis and
um r on to Y
axis now if you could uh use the
dropdown and use the date hierarchies
you can use the year on year month on
month so let's go with month on month or
quarter okay let's go with quarter on
quarter now you can see how are the
sales running quarter on quarter in the
for this particular data set so we have
two years that is 2020 and I mean yeah
2023 and 2024 the quarteron quarter
comparison for year on-ear sales figures
right now let's click on the canvas once
again and now you can choose the over
here and uh so since we
have two genders and I think we also
have a column for age it should be
somewhere in the
list so basically you can derive what
age groups have made the maximum number
of sales
right yeah so here we have
it and the sales so basically it'll
create a bucket right uh age group from
18 age group from 19 2021 and so on now
just go through the orders or you can go
with the price so just drag and drop it
in values and you have it here and you
created a donor chart of it and uh let's
try to create a field map now uh you can
understand which uh area or which region
was the highest uh sales uh we received
so just go through the data set over
here so we have the country just drag
and drop the country and then have the
price or orders you can use anything
okay let's go with the
orders quantity
order and add it in the
values so here we have it so if you
could expand you can find out which
region was the one which give us the
highest number of
orders and there is another simple way
to do it as well if you just double
click on the
[Music]
canvas it will give you a prompt where
you can write
map country
wise map okay map state so we have a
state column here see or
price and uh it will automatically
understand your query and create
a map which will show you the highest
number of sales from the regions or the
region or statewise sales brilliant now
if we proceed into the final chart okay
we have a waterfall chart so now you can
create a waterfall chart so you just
name it
waterfall so we have have uh category
somewhere yeah phall category wise just
enter price or sale and we have a waterf
chart over here based on the categories
you can just drag or you can expand the
canvas to have a clear
picture and uh yeah so far we have dealt
with okay we have a scatter plot we can
do a scatter plot
scatter plot for quantity of orders
received against discount
offered so we should be having quantity
ordered
25 against
discounts or I think we can go with
order rties so it will give us a unique
uh
representation there has been a small
discrepancy order ID or you can also go
with customer ID
against discount
offered so we have a huge data set 2
lakh plus so it might take a little
while to respond to the requests that's
completely all right now what left out
is the kpi so you can also create some
kpis so just double tap and uh write a
kpi for total sales write a
kpi to L this
$9,000 API for total
discount
kpi for discount
percentage or we can use KP for gender
which can tell us how many number of uh
females or how many number of males did
create an order we will be having a
number
here
writing if you could just close these
visualizations over here we can expand
the canvas and you can also have okay we
can also minimize this particular area
and we can also have another
chat or bar bar
graph for types of payments payment
types payment method right so we will be
generating a bar graph with highest
number of payment methods used that is
cash and delivery online payment emis
Etc so it will take a little time to
reflect on this particular screen that's
all right now if you can just go to view
and here you will be having various
options for representing your data set
just click on the best way to represent
your data set there you go so basically
that's how you create okay let's try to
to rearrange our charts a little bit so
that the kpis and kras are clearly
visible there you go so that's how you
create a customer analytics dashboard
using CBI and with that we have come to
an end of this session on customer
analytics dashboard using CBI should you
