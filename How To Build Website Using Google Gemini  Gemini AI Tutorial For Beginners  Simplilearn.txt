you can see a particular search bar you

path this is the same
path I will paste it here and I will
save
it
now let's see if something happened or
not I will refresh it and I will
write
okay let me check the script so as you
can see we have added our script.js
Javascript file to our particular
index.xml file so functioning of this is
if you will write anything in caps
letter so it it will automatically
convert into lower case so uh you can't
see my keyboard uh whether I'm typing in
capital letters or lower case so yeah
I'm writing capital letter but it will
convert into lower kit so what I will
write so if I will search skilles so as
you can see it is uh you know making it
to lower case so these type of things
you can do with JavaScript
right so uh you can customize your fully
website using Google Gemini according to
yourself you can ask anything to Google
Gemini so it will give to you okay so
