professionals in security testing
penetration testing and ethical hacking
utilize linux as their preferred
operating system
provides several configurable
distributions that you may configure
based on your end use
kali linux and parrot os are two popular
penetration testing distributions
while these operating systems each have
unique offerings the overall choice can
differ between personnel thanks to the
various tools and hardware
specifications
today we will look at both these
distributions and settle on the perfect
choice for each type of user
let's go to the agenda for this video
we will learn about kali linux and
pirate security os from scratch while
understanding their primary selling
points as a linux distribution catered
towards penetration testers
next we know about some features of
these operating systems that stand out
of their package
finally we directly compare kal linux
and pirate security os thereby making a
clear-cut conclusion on which os is
perfect on a per requirement basis
so let's start by learning about kali
linux from a ground level
kali linux which is formerly known as
backtrack linux is an open source linux
distribution aimed at advanced
penetration testing and security
auditing
it contains several hundred tools
targeted towards various information
security tasks such as penetration
testing security research computer
forensics and reverse engineering
kali linux is a multi-platform solution
accessible and freely available to
information security professionals and
hobbyists
among all the linux distributions kali
linux takes its roots from the debian
operating system
debian has been a highly dependable and
a stable distribution for many years
providing a similarly strong foundation
to the kali linux desktop
while the operating system can
practically modify every single part of
our installation the networking
components of kali linux come disabled
by default this is done to prevent any
external factors from affecting the
installation procedure which may pose a
risk in critical environments
apart from boosting security it allows a
more profound element of security
control to the most enthusiastic of
users
now let's take a look at pirate security
operating system
parent security os is a debian based
linux distribution with an emphasis on
security privacy and development
it is built on the demian's testing
branch and uses a custom hardened linux
kernel
parrot security contains several hundred
tools targeted towards tasks such as
penetration testing computer forensics
reverse engineering and security
research it is seen as a generally
lightweight distribution that can work
under rigorous hardware and software
specifications
it features a distinct forensics mode
that does not mount any of the system's
hard disks or partitions and has no
influence on the host system making it
much more stealthy than its regular
occurrence
this mode is used on the host system to
execute forensic procedures
a rolling release is a paradigm in which
software upgrades are rolled out
constantly rather than in batches of
versions and software development
this ensures that the software is
constantly up to date a rolling release
distribution such as pirate security os
follows the same concept
it provides the most recent linux kernel
and software versions as soon as they
become available
with the basic introduction to the
operating systems out of the way let us
take a look at the unique features of
both kali linux and pirate security os
the latest version of kali linux comes
with more than 600 penetration tools
pre-installed
after reviewing every tool included in
backtrack developers have eliminated a
significant number of tools that either
simply did not work or duplicated other
tools that provided the same and similar
functionality
the kali linux team comprises a small
group of individuals who are the only
ones trusted to commit packages and
interact with the repositories all of
which is done using multiple secure
protocols
restricting access of critical code
bases to external assets dramatically
reduces the risk of source contamination
which can cause kali linux users
worldwide a great deal of damage as a
direct victim of cyber crime
although penetration tools tend to be
written in english the developers have
ensured that kali includes proper
multilingual support allowing more users
to operate in the native language and
locate the tools they need for the job
the more comfortable a user feels with
the intricacies of the operating system
the easier it is to maintain a strong
hold over the configuration and the
device in general
since arm-based single board systems
like the raspberry pi are becoming more
prevalent and inexpensive the
development team knew that kali's arm
support would need to be as robust as
they could manage with fully working
installations
kali linux is available on a wide range
of arm devices and has erm repositories
integrated with the main line
distribution so the tools for arm are
updated in conjunction with the rest of
the distribution
let's take a look at some of the
features of parrot security operating
system now
along with a giant catalog of scripts
parrot security os has its own hardened
linux kernel modified explicitly to
provide as much security and resistance
to hackers as possible in the first line
of defense
the configurations in the operating
system act as the second gateway taking
care of malicious requests and dropping
them off
this is particularly beneficial since
should there be a scenario where the
latex linux kernel is causing some
particular issue the parrot os
development team will most likely iron
it out first before passing it on as an
update
if the custom hardness kernel wasn't
reason enough parrot security developers
managed to install more hacking tools
and scripts to ensure a smooth
transition for the kali linux users
all the tools you find in kali are
present in parent tools and a few extra
ones for good measure
and this has been achieved while keeping
roughly the same operating system size
between both of them
however it's not all productivity points
for pirate os
they provide a choice between two
different desktop environments mate
which comes pre-installed by default and
kde for those unfamiliar with linux
terminology you can think of desktop
environments as the main ui for a
distribution
being highly modular in nature one can
use parent security os while adding
another desktop environment that they
find appealing
while kal linux has only a single option
pirate security has provided two
optimized builds with made desktop and
kde desktop
one of the primary advantages of parrot
os over kali linux is that it's
relatively lightweight this implies that
it takes significantly less disk space
and computing power to function
correctly with as little as 320 mb of
ram required
in reality paretos is designed to
operate successfully of a usb stick but
kali linux does not work well from a usb
drive and is generally installed in a
virtual machine
parrot os is more of a niche
distribution if you are searching for
something lighter than kali linux
features are great but what about
performance
real world metrics
let us compare both these operating
systems directly with respect to their
hardware specifications and usability
in the end we can decide on what
distribution is fit for each type of
user
for a first point of comparison let's
take a look at the ramp required
for optimum performance of the operating
system which is highly essential when
trying to crack hashes or something of
similar nature ram usage is a very
important facet while kali linux demands
at least 1 gb of ram pirate security can
operate optimally with a minimum of 320
mb of ram
for correctly displaying graphical
elements kali linux requires gpu based
acceleration while this is not the case
with parrot security os which doesn't
require any graphical acceleration
needed from the user side
once these operating systems are
installed on vmware using their live
boot isos
they take up a minimum amount of hard
disk storage
both of these operating systems have a
recommended disk storage of minimum of
20 gb in kali linux and a minimum of 15
gb in parrot security so they can
install all the tools necessary in the
iso file
when it comes to the category and the
selection of tools kali linux has always
been the first in securing every single
tool available for hackers in the
penetration testing industry
parrot security on the other hand has
managed to take it up a notch
while specializing in wireless pen
testing parent security makes it a point
that all the tools that kali linux
provides has been included in the iso
while simultaneously adding some extra
tools that many users will have to
install from third party sources in kali
linux
being a decade-old penetration testing
distribution kali linux has formed up a
very big community with strong support
signature parrot security on the other
hand is still growing and it is
garnering much more interest among
veteran penetration testers and ethical
hackers
a primary drawback of kali linux is the
extensive hardware requirement
to perform optimally it requires higher
memory than parallel security it also
needs graphical acceleration while
demanding more virtual hard disk storage
pirate security on the other hand was
initially designed to run off a usb
drive directly thereby requiring very
minimal requirements from a hardware
perspective like just 320 mb of ram and
no graphical acceleration needed this
means pirate security is much more
feasible for people who are not able to
devote massive resources to either their
virtual machine or on their laptop hard
disk directly
with the comparison done between both of
these operating systems
let's take a look at the type of users
both of these are catered to
one can go with kali linux if they want
the extensive community support offered
by its users
if they want to go with a trusted
development team that have been working
on this distribution since many years
if they have a powerful system which can
run kali linux optimally without having
to bottleneck performance
and if they are comfortable with a
semi-professional environment which may
or may not be very useful for new
beginners
one can decide to go with parrot
security if they want to go with a very
lightweight and lean distribution that
can run pretty much on all systems
it also has a lot of tools pre-installed
and some of them are not even present on
kali linux
it is much more suitable for
underpowered rigs where users do not
have a lot of hardware resources to
provide to the operating system and
thereby it is much more feasible for
people with underpowered laptops or no
graphical acceleration
compared to kali linux parrot security's
desktop environment is also relatively
easier to use for new beginners
for people who are just getting into
ethical hacking pallet security does a
relatively better job
of introducing them to the operating
system and to the various tools without
having to dump them into the entire
intricacies
