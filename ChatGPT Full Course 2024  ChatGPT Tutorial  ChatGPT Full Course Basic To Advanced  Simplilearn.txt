let's get started meet John a talented
programmer who is looking to start a
company that used his personally
developed mobile application to connect
restaurants and customers for booking
and
reservations even though the app was
ready JN had difficulty getting together
a team for his startup meing separate
people for sales marketing programming
content creation and customer support
hiring reliable Manpower while being
strict with his budget was getting
difficult he reached out to his friend
Ryan who said JN could start his company
without hiring any new people thanks to
just a single AI based tool John
couldn't believe it which led Ryan to
introduce chat GPT the Revolutionary AI
chatbot being developed by open AI it is
a state-of-the-art natural language
processing or NLP model that uses a
neural network architecture to provide
responses this means that the chat GPT
bot can answer questions without being
explicitly told what the answer is using
its own intellect unlike previous AI
chat bots so how does chat GPT help John
and filling out his
team regarding sales chat GPT can
provide full-fledged sales pitches based
on the correct prompts it can provide
tips on how to pitch your product
businesses removing the need for sales
training completely customized to your
requirements and your prompts if you
don't like some things about the
response you can ask for certain changes
and the chatbot will make sure they are
done when it comes to marketing chat GPT
can provide efficient marketing
strategies which can help new
entrepreneurs learn how to Market their
products to prospective clients it can
provide trending keywords that marketers
can use for SEO purposes while providing
add copies for your website and blog
speaking of websites since John can do a
lot of the heavy lifting in programing
chat GPT can help proofread the code and
help out when looking for bugs to fix
apart from basic bug fix in it can also
provide sample code structures for
different programming languages allowing
John to focus more on improving core
functionality and workflow rather than
fixing basic code
errors websites and blogs content is
very helpful in gathering potential
customer
leads the Revolutionary bot can provide
fulllength blog posts with near perfect
fast accuracy in seconds allowing
further customization like choosing the
length of the subject matter to the
complexity of of language for John's
customer support the black can draft
complete customer service emails based
on the situation saving time and
resources the tone of the message can be
changed to reflect the nature of the
message creating an efficient
alternative for call center
professionals Jean was left speechless
seeing this level of Versatility from
chat GPT and wanted to implement it
right away however Ryan made sure JN
knew about some drawbacks of the chatbot
before getting started since the bot is
trained mostly on data up to 2021 many
of the newer events May still need to be
discovered by chat GPT even basic stuff
like asking about the current date and
time is beyond its scope much like the
limited understanding of context despite
providing near lifelike solutions to
certain problems even the accuracy of
many responses can be questioned since
the AI model is still learning and being
developed there is a section of the
public that believes the Revolutionary
tool can one day replace Google search
but that day seems farfetched so far
because of the variety of issues people
keep running into in using chat
GPT however chat GPT poses a lot of
promise for the future of AI from full-
skilled automated divisions and
organizations to serving as the perfect
digital assistant open AI is creating a
bot for the future aimed at solving the
problems of today with the tools of
Tomorrow the ability to carry out a
myriad of tasks with minimum Manpower
will boost productivity at organizations
in every sector
thanks to the Revolutionary chat
GPT so how do you think chat GPT will
benefit your daily life are you looking
forward to using the bot regularly for
work or personal life let us know your
thoughts in the comments below meet John
a software developer JN develops a
program and now he realizes the program
is surrounded by a lot of
bugs John starts exploring a solution he
surfs through the internet checks
programmer communities
doubting every step of the way JN feels
his problem is not
solved desperate to find the solution
John meets his friend Adam Adam comes up
with an idea of an artificially
intelligent and practical solution
called the chat
GPT Adam says chat GPT has the caliber
to systematically resolve all the bugs
with an elaborate explanation for every
step it makes chat GPT is an AI trained
model that works in a conversational way
developed by open
AI fascinated by hearing this John asks
Adam to explain them in detail after
Adam explains that GPT AKA generative
retraining Transformer has come a long
way before the introduction of GPT
natural language processing used to deal
with a specific task with large amounts
of data GPT was first released in 2018
which contained 117 million parameters
GPT gpt2 and
gpt3 each one is stronger than the one
before it the main reason why GPT
received little attention was that it
was more of an idea or test than a
finished product but after the
introduction of gpt2 it gained a lot of
attention as it could accurately predict
the word that would begin a text then
they introduced
gpt3 which is a strong language model
achieving translation question Ing and
Performing three-digit
arithmetic but chat GPT Stands Tall
compared to all other achievements of
open AI so how does it work chat GPT
uses deep learning techniques to
generate humanlike text it is based on
the machine learning model derived from
the class called the large language
model chat GPT is a byproduct of
instruct GPT instruct GPT introduced a
strategy for integrating human feedback
into the training process to match model
outputs this Innovative technology made
chat GPT exceptional it is trained on
the massive data sets of text from the
internet and learns from the patterns
and relationships between words and
phrases it responds to a prompt by
determining the next word based on the
context then repeats the process until a
stop condition is met as a result chat
GPT can produce various logical
responses to various queries and prompts
the most important component of of chat
GPT are the Transformer model and
language model coming to the Transformer
model it is a neural network
architecture designed to process
sequential data it consists of multiple
layers of self attention and a feed
forward Network after the Transformer
model has processed the input a decoder
generates the output the decoder uses
the context provided by the encoder to
generate the response the model is
trained using unsupervised learning and
fine-tuned on specific tasks using
supervised learning for successful
completion of tasks it needs pre-trained
data the model first encodes the input
text then converts it to a numerical
representation which can be processed by
the model's neural network this encoding
is done using the embedded layer that
Maps the word then comes the language
model chat GPT is trained as a language
model trained to predict the next word
in a sequence given the previous words
the language model intends to produce
rational consistent and meaningful
output the pre-trained chat GPT can be
tuned for a specific task so chat GPT
passes a fine-tuning test by answering
questions generating text summaries or
generating text in response to a query
overall chat GPT is a powerful language
model with a combination of techniques
like deep learning machine learning
neural networks and natural language
processing chat GPT change a wide
variety of business tasks John asked
chat GPT possesses the ability to
automate content creation on social
media create chatbot and e-commerce
sites provide medical assistance by
acting as a symptom checker write code
and assist a developer thus chat GPT can
change the working of every industry now
John can resolve any coding issue
without looking into any other resources
but like any other technology chat GPT
comes with a few limitations that can be
its Achilles heal chat GPT is capable of
developing content up to 2021 it finds
difficulty in providing logical
reasoning in certain situations and also
chat GPT lags and translation
summarization and sometimes question
answering but above all chat GPT has
shown remarkable ability by providing
accurate answers flawlessly in a
creative way in very short periods of
time
today we will dive into the latest e
advancements comparing chat gp4 and the
newly launched chat GPT 40 chj 40 offers
a 30% Improvement in factual accuracy
and excels in Creative task we'll reveal
the top upgrades and how they can
transform your AI experience get ready
for an in-depth look at these powerful
tools and find out which one is the game
changer you have been waiting for so
let's explore the future of AI together
so first we'll start with the official
documentation and those who want to jump
straight to the comparison of chj 4 and
4 can directly jump to it with the time
stamp mentioned in the description box
so let's start with documentation so
guys here we have searched about the
chat GPT photo documentation and this is
the official page of open
Ai and here you can find out that they
have put on advancements and the model
capabilities that jg4 processes you
could see here they have posted the
video videos that two GPD 4os are
interacting and singing you can play and
watch these videos so how they have
advanced this Chad gb4 compared to chat
jb4 and you could see uh the vision
capabilities of Chad
G4 as they are asking for the interview
preparation with their Vision
capabilities so similarly you can check
out all the other videos that they have
posted and moving downwards we can see
that they have posted explorations of
capabilities you could select the sample
that could be visual narratives or
poster creation for the movie or
character design so you could check out
how CH G4 and 40 are
different and as we move down here they
have mentioned the model evaluations
between chat GT4 and chat GT4 turo here
we have the text evaluation audio ASR
Performance Audio translation
performance
and they have posted the bar graphs and
the charts with all the other AI tools
compared and then we have the language
tokenization and what improvements they
have made in that that is they have used
Gujarati language Telugu Tamil marati
Hindi and they have achieved the fewer
tokens in these models Now we move
downwards we can see that the model
safety and limitations they have added
some more safety features
and the model availability that is chity
4 is available for both the free version
and the paid version so this was all
about the official documentation of chat
jpt 4 so let's get started with the
comparision analysis of chat jpt 4 and
four so guys I have opened chat gbt 4
here and in the other window we'll open
chat JT 4 and we'll provide the same
prompts to both CH gp4 and for and we'll
see
what responses they provide to us and in
what time frame we'll compare the time
frame also and how they conceptualize or
provide the fractional prompts to
responses so starting with number one so
the number one category we will be
choosing is factual inquiries so we will
ask both of them and will ask
them that tell me something interesting
about about
merury and provide to CH4 also so let's
press enter and see which one of those
will provide
us a good
response uh so you could see that CH GT4
has provided us the response in a
paragraph and if we read this so the
tone is
okay like it is telling to a third
person and if we move to chat je4 you
could see here that it has categorized
the points here that these are the main
points that you could use as an
interesting points about
merury so I would say CH GT40 has an
edge
here and I won't think like there was a
time difference and I can say that we
can't have any difference in the time
taken by both the
models so now we'll move to next
category that is complex scientific and
Technical problems so here we will ask
both the models about how quantum
computers work and compare their
advantages to classical
computers so let's ask
them that
explain how quantum computers
and compare their
advantages to classical
computers we'll copy the same prompt and
paste it to CH GPT 4 also so let's press
enter and till then I will tell you guys
that from here you can use the different
model also that you have used GPD 4 here
it's showing you after generating the
response I will show you guys how you
can switch to the models
also here you can copy it and here you
can read it loud and in the settings
also you can check out what voices you
need as an assistant here so moving back
we can see that CH GT4 is still
responding and generating the response
while CH GT 4 has already done it we can
surely say that that chbt 4 has an edge
with the time frame thing as it
generated the response much faster than
CH4 and if we compare what the responses
they have provided and chat jpd 4 has
mentioned how quantum computers work
advantages of quantum computers
comparison with classical computers and
after that challenges that quantum
computers are facing and if we see what
CH4 has provided you could see that how
quantum computers work and after that
the advantages of quantum computers and
the comparison with classical computers
so you could see that with the less time
frame CH GT 4 has provided more
subtopics and the more points that he
has covered whereas CH GT4 has provided
the least information but he has
provided the okay information that we
are sufficiently acquired with the
prompt but definitely I will give an H2
char4 here so
I was telling you about the change model
thing so you can click here and check
out chat gbt 4 and chat gb4 if you click
here chat jpt 4 it will generate the
response again with jp4 model as we have
select the chat jpt 4 model here but
neglecting that he will generate with
the chat gbt 4
model so here after generating the
response if you click
on 1/2 so these arrows you can find out
this response has been generated by GPT
for model and this response has been
generated by GPD 4 model and you can
have this comparison in the same window
also but I using different windows so
we'll compare it in one another
only so now moving to the next section
that is creative writing so now we'll
ask both these models to write a short
poem about a moonlit night in a forest
so let's ask them that write a short
poem about a
moonlit night and a
forest so let's copy the same prompt and
paste it in
gbd4 and let's wait for the response as
you guys can see that GPD 4 has already
generated the response
and here gp4s also
generated and before comparing both
these responses I want you guys to
notice something that this new version
of open AI that is GPT they have moved
the profile section from bottom left to
top right and there are many more
advancements if you see here this is the
history section and the memory
feature and you could find many other
features that could be manage memory in
the profile sections only
so if you go into personalized category
here we have the memory
section so moving back to the prompt
response so here we have the gp4
model and if we read this poem in the
forest de with shadows play the moon
cast light in a silver aray Whispers of
leaves in a gentle breeze dance with the
night in serin silent E and if We
compare this so gp4 has provided a
really a short poem whereas GPT 4 has
provided us the four Paras and if I tell
you about the tone so GPT 40 has an edge
here as it has provided a really crafted
good poem then
gp4 so now we'll compare these models on
the basis of text analysis skills or
before that we will compare them on
complex mathematical and logical queries
so we'll ask them to solve a quadratic
equation and we'll provide them the
equation solve the
equation that would
be
3x² -
12x + 9 =
0 and explain each step
so let's see which model does IT job
better so you could see the writing
speed also like how this cursor is
moving I would definitely say that CH GT
4 has a good speed
here and it has generated the response
and gb4 has also generated the response
so I would say that GPT 4 has taken six
steps to solve this and provided a
detailed information how you can solve
the quadratic equation and whereas GPD 4
has shown us the three steps and he has
integrated other steps in step one only
that is factorize the quadratic
equation so if you are a beginner you
could definitely switch to J gd4 to
understand these quadratic equations or
mathematical
equations so giving another point to
chat4 here now we'll move to another
category that is data analysis questions
so now we'll provide a data set to both
of
them uh so this will be the data samples
sales
data so here we will ask both the models
to
create a bar
chart between
sales and
region you would see that both the
models are
analyzing and here we are j4 has
provided us the response and the main
thing that I want to showcase here is
that j4 has now interactive images or
bar graphs or the visual representations
here if you click to static chart they
have an option here so now this bar
chart is not
static and you could just have the plain
2D design and if we click on this again
you could see that you could find the
actual figure what has been showcased in
the bar graph and similarly here you
could change the data set color
that is you can change the color of the
bar graphs or the bars in the
graph and moreover you have the download
section here also and the expand section
if you expand it you could see that here
you can generate the response and chat
with gp4 model and have the output
here so we
will get back to the window and here you
can see that Chad gbt 4 has provided us
the basic response as it was previously
also so here's the bar chart and no
interactive design and no download
option moreover no other expanding
options also so let's move to the next
category and that would be our last
category so now we'll ask both the
models about solving philosophical and
ethical problems so now we'll ask them
do animals have moral rights so justify
your answer
we'll copy paste the same prompt to gp4
model and ask both of them to generate
the
response so you could see that both has
generated the responses and if we
compare them so chat GPT 4 has provided
the number one point that is argument
for moral rights of animals and then the
second point that is argument against
moral rights of animals and if we move
to GPT 40 section he has also provided
the main topics but he has provided the
subtopics and highlighted what are the
main key points for both that is moral
rights and against moral rights so I
would definitely say that jt4 has
improved factual accuracy and response
discipline like he has a framework to
provide the response whereas CH GT4 just
provide the response in a basic
Manner and one more category we'll see
here that is we will ask him to create
an
image
of two
robots
fighting or facing each
other or in a face
off so let's copy the same prompt to jbt
for model
also so here's the response you can see
that J jpd 4 has
generated an image with two robots in a
dramatic face off in a futuristic Arena
and whereas that gp4 has also generated
two futuristic robots in a dramatic pH
off and I would definitely say that gp4
has done a good job
here his image is much better than
jp4 so if I tell you about the
conclusion so choosing between chat gp4
and chat GPT 40 depends largely on your
specific needs if your work requires
detailed analysis and you often engage
in complex discussions then Chad gyy for
might be the better choice with its deep
understanding and retention capabilities
however if you need quick turnaround
times and are managing multiple task or
collaboration speed and efficiency will
likely serve you better so both tools
have their merits and can significantly
enhance your content creation process
and other data analysis processes so as
these Technologies evolve staying
informed about updates will help you
continue making the best use of jni in
your work so here's the open a
documentation and you could see the the
new features introduced with the chat
GPD 40 so these are the improvements uh
one is the updated and interactive bar
graphs or pie charts that you can create
and these are the features that you
could see here you could change the
color you could download it and what we
have is you could update the latest file
versions directly from Google Drive and
Microsoft One drive and we have the
interaction with tables and charts in a
new expandable view that I showed you
here that is here you can expand it in
the new window and you can customize and
download charts for presentations and
documents moreover you can create the
presentation also that we'll see in
further and here we have how data
analysis Works in chat
jbt you could directly upload the files
from Google Drive and Microsoft One
Drive I'll will show you guys how we can
do that and where this option is and we
can work on tables in real
time and there we have customized
presentation ready charts that is you
can create a presentation with all the
charts based on a data provided by you
and moreover a comprehensive security
and privacy feature so with that guys
we'll move to chat jity and here we have
the chat GPT 40 version so this is the
PIN section or the insert section where
you can have the options to connect to
Google Drive connect to Microsoft One
drive and you can upload it from the
computer this option was already there
that is upload from computer and you can
upload at least or at Max the 10 files
that could be around Excel files or
documents so the max limit is 10 and if
you have connected to Google Drive I'll
show you guys uh I'm not connecting
you but you guys can connect it to and
you could upload it from there also and
there's another cool update that is
ability to quote directly your chat uh
so while chatting with chat gbt I'll
show you guys how we can do that and you
could find some new changes that is in
the layout so this is the profile
section it used to be at the left bottom
but now it's moved to the top right and
making it more accessible than ever so
let's start with the data analysis part
and the first thing we need is data so
you can find it on kager or you could
ask CH GT4 to provide the data I'll will
show you guys so this is the kagle
website you can sign in here and click
on data sets you can find all the data
sets here that would be around Computer
Science Education classification
computer vision or else you could move
back to chat
GPD and you could ask the chat gp4 model
to generate a data and provide it in
Excel format so you'll ask him we'll not
ask him can you we'll just ask him
provide a data set
that I can use for data
analysis
and provide in CSV
format so you could see that it has
responded that I can provide a sample
data set and he has started generating
the data set
here so you could see that he has
provided only 10 rows and he is saying
that I will now generate this data set
in CSA format first he has the visual
presentation on the screen and now it's
generating the CSV format so if you want
more data like if you want 100 rows or
thousand rows you could specify in the
prompt and chat jpt will generate that
for
you so we already have the data I will
import that data you could import it
from here or else you can import it from
your Google Drive so we have a sales
data here we will open
it so we have the sales dat here so the
first step we need to do is data
cleaning so this is the crucial step to
ensure that the accuracy of file
analysis is at its best so we can do
that by handling missing values that is
missing values can distort our analysis
and here chat gb4 can suggest methods to
impute these values such as using the
mean median or a sophisticated approach
Based on data patterns and after
handling the missing values we will
remove duplicates and outlier detection
so will'll ask chat
jpt clean the
data if
needed so we can just write a simple
prom that would be clean the data if
needed and this is also a new feature
you can see the visual presentation of
the data here that we have 100 rows here
and the columns provided that is sales
ID date product category quantity and
price per unit and total sales so this
is also new feature that
okay uh we just head it
back we'll move back to our chat GPT
chat
here okay so here we are so you could
see that chj has cleaned the data and he
has provided that it has checked for
missing values checked for duplicates
and Ensure consistent formatting and
he's
saying
okay okay so now we will ask him that
execute these
steps
and provide the clean
data as chj has provided that these are
the steps to clean the data and let's
see so he has provided a new CSV file
with the clean sales data we will
download
it and ask him to use the same file
only use this new
cleaned sales data CSV
file for further
analysis so you could see that he is
providing what analysis we can do
further but once our data is clean the
next step is visualization so
visualizations help us understand the
data better by providing a graphical
representation so the first thing we
will do is we will create a prompt for
generating the histograms and we'll do
that for the age distribution part so
we'll write a prompt that generat
histogram generator histogram to
visualize the distribution of C
ages to
visualize the
distribution of customer
ages and what I was telling you guys is
this code button if you just select the
text and you would find this reply
section just click on that and you could
see that it has selected the text or
what you want to get all the prompts
started with chat jpd so
we'll make it cross and you could see
that it has provided the histogram here
and these are the new features here and
we could see that he is providing a
notification that interactive charts of
this type are not yet supported that is
histogram don't have the color Change
option I will show you the color Change
option in the bar chart section so these
features are also new you can download
that chart from here only and this is
the expand chart if you click on that
you could see that you could expand the
chart here and continue chat with chat
GT here so this is the interactive
section so you could see that he has
proved the histogram that is showing the
distribution of customer ages and the
age range are from 18 to 70 years with
the distribution visualized in 15 bins
that he has created 15 bin Here and Now
moving to another visualization
that we will do by sales by region so
before that I will open the CSV file
that is provided by the chat GPT so you
guys can also see what data he has
provided so this is the clean sales data
and you could see that we have columns
sales ID date product category quantity
price per item total sales region and
sales
person so now moving back to chat
so now we will create a bar chart
showing total sales by region so we'll
enter this prompt that create a bar
chart showing total
sales by
region so what we are doing here is we
are creating bar charts or histogram
charts but we can do that for only two
columns if we want to create these data
visualization charts we need two columns
to do so so you could see that he has
provided the response and created the
bar chart here and this is the
interactive section you could see that
here's an option to switch to static
chart if we click on that we can't like
we are not getting any information we
scroll on that and if I enable this
option you could see that I can visually
see how many numbers this bar is
indicating and after that we have the
change color section
you can change the color of the data set
provided so we can change it to any
color that is provided here or you could
just write the color code
here and similarly we have other two
options that is download and another is
the expand chart
section and if you need uh what code it
has done to figure out this bar graph so
this is the code you could use any ID to
do so if you don't want the
presentations or the visualizations of
the bar charts here you could use your
ID and use the Python language and he
will provide the code for you just take
your data set and read it through pandas
and generate the bar
charts so moving to next section that is
category wise sales section so here we
will generate a pie chart showing the
proportion of sales for each product
category so for that we'll try a
prompt generate a py
chart showing the proportion of
sales for each product
category so you could see that it has
started generating the pie chart and
this is also an interactive section
if you click on that you would be seeing
a static pie chart and if you want to
change the color you can change for any
section that could be clothing
Electronics furniture or
kitchen and similarly we have the
download section and the expand chart
section so this is how this new chat jpd
4 model is better than chat jpd
4 that you could use a more interactive
pie charts you could change the colors
for that and you can just just H over
these bar charts and found all the
information according to them so after
this data visualization now we'll move
to statistical analysis so this will
help us uncover patterns and
relationships in the data so the first
thing we'll do is correlation analysis
and for that we'll write the prompt
analyze the correlation between age and
purchase amount so this correlation
analysis help us understand the
relationship between two variables so
this can indicate if older customers
tend to spend more or
less so we will find out that by
analyzing the data and we provide a PR
to chat JY that analyze
the correlation between age and purchase
amount so let's see what it
provides uh so here's the response by
chat gbt
you could see a scatter plot that shows
the relationship between customer age
and total sales that is with a
calculated correlation coefficient of
approximately 0.16 so this indicates a
weak positive correlation between age
and purchase amount suggesting that as
customer age increases there's a slight
tendency for total sales to increase as
well so you could just see the scatter
Pro here that if the age increases so is
not correlated to sales as you would see
an empty graph here so till 40 to 50
years of age over the 70 years of age
you could find what amount they have
spent here that is the total sales
accumulated by these
ages so now mov to sales Trend so here
we will perform a Time series analysis
of purchase amount or the given dates so
what does this do is time series
analysis allows us to examine how sales
amount changes over time helping us
identify Trends and seasonal patterns so
for that we'll write a
prompt
performer time series
analysis of purchase
amount or given dates
so you could see that chgb has provided
us the response and here is the time
series plot showing total sales or the
given dates and each point on the plot
represents the total sales for a
particular
day so through this you can find out and
the businesses find out which is the
seasonal part of the year and where to
stock up the stocks for these kind of
dates
and after that you could also do
customer segmentation so what does this
do is so we can use clustering here to
segment customers based on age income
and purchase amount so clustering groups
customers into segments based on
similarities this is useful for targeted
marketing and personalized
services and after that we have the
advanced usage for data analysis here we
can draw a predictive modeling table and
do the market analysis and perform a
customer lifetime value analysis so we
will see one of those and what we'll do
is we'll perform a Market Basket
analysis and perform an association rule
mining to find frequently both together
products so the theory behind this is
the association rule mining helps
identify patterns of products that are
often purchased together aiding in
inventory management and cross selling
strategies so for that we'll write a
prompt that so perform an association
rule mining to find frequently both
together products so for that we'll
write a prompt here perform an
association rule
mining to find frequently
bought products
together so let's see for this prompt
what does CH j4 respond to us
uh so you could see that he is providing
a code here but we don't need a code
here we need the
analysis
don't provide
code do the Market Basket
analysis and provide visualizations
so you could see that uh Chad JT has
provided the response that given the
limitations in this environment so he is
not able to do the Market Basket
analysis here so but he can help us how
we can perform this in N ID so he's
providing you can install the required
libraries then prepare the data and here
is providing the example code so you
could see there are some limitations to
chat gp4 also that he can't do Advanced
Data analysis so you could use the code
in your ID and do the Market Basket
analysis there so there are some
limitations to chat GPT 4 also and now
we will ask chat GPT can you create a
presentation based on the data set and
we'll provide a data set to it also
so we will provide a sample sales
data and we'll ask him can you create a
presentation or PowerPoint
presentation based on this data
set and only
provide data
visualization
graphs so you can see that J GT 4 has
started analyzing the data and he is
stating that and he will start by
creating a data visualization from the
provided data set and compile them into
PowerPoint
presentation so you could see that CH4
has provided us the response and these
are all the presentations or the
paragraphs that he has created and now
we have downloaded the presentation here
we will open
that and here's the presentation that is
created by chat jpt 40 so now let's see
steps to get an AI engineer job so to
thrive in this field developing a
comprehensive skill set is a crucial
while encompasses May specialized areas
so here are some certain C skills that
are essential across most roles so here
is you can build these skills first one
is technical skills so AI roles heavily
rely on technical expertise particularly
in programming data handling or working
with AI specific tools or you can say
the cloud specific tools so here are
some key areas to focus on the first one
is the programming languages so profen
in joural purpose programming language
like Python and R is the fundamental
python in particular is widely used in
AI for Simplicity and robust liability
such as enflow and python which are
crucial for machine learning and deep
learning task the second one is database
management so understanding how to
manage and manipulate large data set is
essential in AI familiarity with
database Management Systems like Apache
Cassandra couch base and dynamodb will
allow you to store retrieve and process
data efficiently the third one data
analysis and statistics
strong skills in data analysis are must
tools like matlb Excel and pandas are
invaluable for statical analysis data
manipulation and visualization Trends
and data which are critical for
developing AI models fourth one Cloud AI
platform knowing of cloud-based AI
platforms such as Microsoft Azure AI
Google Cloud Ai and IBM Watson is
increasingly important so these platform
provide pre-build models tools and
infrastructure that can accelerate AI
development and deployment the second
one is industry knowledge while
technical skills from the backbone of
your AI expertise understanding the
industry context is equally important
for example knowing how AI integrates
with digital marketing goals and
strategies can be significant Advantage
if you are working in or targeting
Industries like e-commerce or
advertising so industry specific
knowledge allows you to apply AI
Solutions more effectively and
communicate their value to stakeholders
the third one workplace or soft skills
in addition to technical industry
specific skills developing workpl skills
or you can say soft skill is essential
for success in AI roles or any roles so
these soft skills often H through
experience include the first one is
communication clearly articulating
complex AI concept to non-technical
stakeholder is crucial whether you are
explaining how machine learning model
works or presenting data driven Insight
effective communication ensure that your
work is understood and value second one
is collaboration AI projects often
require teamwork across diverse field
including data science software
development and other things the third
one is analytical thinking AI is
fundamentally about problem solving you
will need a strong analytical thinking
skills to approach challenges logically
break them down into manageable parts
and develop Innovative solution the
fourth one problem solving AI projects
frequently involve unexpected challenges
whether it's a technical bu or an
unforeseen data issue strong problem
solving will help you navigate these
hurdles and key projects on TR so
building these skills can be achieved
through various methods including
self-study online courses boot camps or
formal education additionally working on
real projects contributing to open
source CI initiatives and seeking
mentorship can provide practical
experience and further enhance your
expertise so next thing is learn
Advanced topics so as you Advan in your
machine Learning Journey it is important
to delve into more advanced topics these
areas will deepen your understandings
and help you tackle complex problem so
some key topics to focus are the first
one is deep learning and neural network
the second thing is enable learning
techniques the third thing is generative
models and advertis learning fourth one
is recommendation system and
collaborative filtering the fifth one is
time series analysis and forecasting so
now let's move forward and see some
machine learning P so working on real
world projects to apply your knowledge
focus on data collection and prepar
Capstone project in image recognition
and NLP predictive modeling and animal
detection practical experience key to
solidifying your skills so now let's
move forward and see what is the next
skill that is ear a certification so if
you are already hold on undergraduate
degree in a field of related to AI
enrolling in specialized course to
enhance your technical skills can be
highly beneficial even if you don't have
a degree earning certification can show
potential imp employers that you are
committed to your career goals and
actively investing in your professional
development so you can unleash your
career potential with our artificial
intelligence and machine learning
courses tailor for diverse Industries
and roles at top Global forms a program
features key tools enhance your AI
knowledge and business equipment join
the job market and become soft after
professional the next thing is
continuous learning and exploration so
stay updated with the latest development
by following industry leaders engaging
in online Mage and working on person
project pursue Advanced learning through
courses and certification to keep your
skills sharp so now let's move forward
and see some AI career opportunities
with salary so the job market for
machine learning professional is booming
the average annual salary for AI
Engineers can be very based on location
experience and Company so here are some
roles like machine learning engineer
data scientist NLP engineer computer
vision and AIML researcher so now let's
see how much they earn the first one is
ml engineer so machine learning
Engineers earn $153,000 in us and 11
lakh in India per anom the second one is
data CST the data CST earn $150,000 in
us and 12 lakh perom in India the third
one is NLP engineer they earn
$117,000 in us and 7 lakh in India perom
fourth one is compter Vision engineer CV
engineer they earn around
$126,000 in us and 650,000 in in India
the last one is AIML researchers they
earn
$130,000 in us and in India they earn
around 9 lakh perm so note that these
figures can vary on website to website
and changes frequently so now last step
is start applying for entry-level jobs
when you feel confident in your training
begin researching and applying for jobs
many entry-level AI positions like
software engineer or developer roles are
often labeled as entry level or Junior
in the job description jobs that require
less than 3 years of experience are
usually suitable for those Juds starting
out if you need additional support in
your job research consider applying for
internship taking on freelance project
or participating in hackathons to
further hor your skills so these
opportunities not only provide valuable
feedback on your work but also help you
build connection that could benefit your
career in the future on July 25th open
AI introduce search gbt a new search
tool changing how we find information
online unlike traditional search engines
which require you to type in specific
keywords SBT lets you ask question in
natural everyday language just like
having a conversation so this is a big
shift from how we were used to searching
the web instead of thinking in keywords
and hoping to find the right result you
can ask now sir gbd exactly what you
want to know and it will understand the
context and give you direct answers it
designed to make searching easy easier
and more intuitive without going through
links and pages but with this new way of
searching so there are some important
question to consider can sgpt compete
with Google the sech giant we all know
what makes sgpt different from AI
overviews another recent search to and
how does it compare to chat GPT open AI
popular conversational AI so in this
video we are going to explore these
questions and more we will look at what
makes a
special how it it compares to other
tools and why it might change the way we
search for information whether you are
new into Tech or just curious this video
will break it down in simple words stick
around to learn more about sgbd so what
is Ser gbd Ser GPT is a new search
engine prototype developed by open AI
designed to enhance the way we search
for information using AI unlike a
typical jetbot like chpt Ser GPT isn't
just about having a conversation it's
focused on improving the search
experience with some key features the
first one is direct answer instead of
Simply showing you a list of links Serb
delivers direct answer to your question
for example if you ask what is the best
wireless noise cancellation headphone in
2024 sgbt will summarize the top choices
highlighting their pros and cons based
on Expert reviews and user opinions so
this approach is different from the
traditional search engines that
typically provide a list of links
leading to various articles or videos
the second one is relevant sources s GPD
responses come with clear citations and
links to the original sources ensuring
transparency and accuracy so this way
you can easily verify the information
and delve deeper into the topic if you
want the third one conversational search
sgbd allows you to have a back and forth
dialogue with the search engine you can
ask follow-up questions or refine your
original query based on the responsive
you receive making your search
experience more interactive and
personalized now let's jump into the
next topic which is Sir gbt versus
Google so sir gbt is being talked about
a major competitor to Google in the
future so let's break down how they
differ in their approach to search the
first one is conversational versus
keyword based search search GPT uses a
conversational interface allowing user
to ask question in natural language and
refine their queries through follow-up
question so this creates a more
Interactive search experience on the
other hand Google relies on
keyword-based search where user enter
specific terms to find relevant web
pages the second thing is direct answer
versus list of links so one of the
search gpds standout feature is its
ability to provide direct answers to the
question it summarizes information from
the various sources and clearly sites
them so you don't have to click through
multiple links Google typically present
a list of links leaving user to shift
through the result to find the
information they need the third one AI
powered understanding versus keyword
matching sir gpds uses AI to understand
the intent behind your question offering
more relevant result even if your query
isn't perfectly worded Google's primary
method is keyword matching which can
sometimes lead to less accurate result
especially for complex queries the
fourth one Dynamic context versus
isolated searches so search gbt
maintains content across multiple
interaction allowing for more person
personized responses whereas Google
treats e search as a separate query
without remembering previous interaction
and the last one real time information
versus index web pages Ser is aim to
provide the latest information using
realtime data from the web whereas
Google V index is comprehensive but may
include outdated or less relevant
information so now let's jump into the
next topic which is sgbd versus AI
overviews so sgbd and AI overviews both
use AI but they approach search and
information delivery differently it's
also worth noting that both tools are
still being developed so their features
and capabilities May evolve and even
overlap as they grow so here are the
differences the first one is Source
attribution Ser gbt provides clear and
direct citation linked to the original
sources making it easy for user to
verify the information whereas AI
overviews include links the citation may
not always be clear or directly
associated with specific claims the
second one is transparency control sgbt
promises greater transparency by
offering Publishers control over how
their content is used including the
option to opt out of AI training AI
overviews offer less transparency
regarding the selection of content and
the summarization process used the next
one is scope and depth Serb strives to
deliver detailed and comprehensive
answers pulling from a broad range of
sources including potential multimedia
content and in AI overviews offers a
concise summary of key points often with
links for further exploration but with a
more limited scope now let's jump into
the next part Ser GPT versus Chad GPT
Ser GPT and CH GPT both developed by
open a share some core features but
serve different purposes so here are
some differences the first one is
primary purpose Ser gbd designed for
search providing direct answer and
sources from the web whereas sgbt focus
on conversational AI in text responses
the second one is information sources
sgbt relies on realtime information from
the web whereas sh GPD knowledge based
on this training data which might not be
current the third one is response format
s GPD prioritize concise answers with
citation and Source links so whereas
sgbt is more flexible generating longer
text summarizes creative content code
and Etc the next feature is use cases
serg idal for fact finding research and
task requiring up to- dat information
whereas CHP is suitable for creative
writing print storming drafting emails
and other openend T so now question
arises when will sgpt be released sgpt
is currently in a limited prototype
phase meaning it's not yet widely
available open a is testing with a
select group to gather feedback and
improve the tool so if you are
interested in trying serd so you can
join the weight list on its web page but
you will need a chgb account a full
public release by the end of 2024 is
unlikely as openi hasn't set a timeline
it's more probable that sgbd features
will gradually added to the Chad GPD in
2024 or in 2025 with the potential
Standalone release later based on
testing and the feedback Welcome to our
comprehensive tutorial on creating a
fully functional e-commerce application
using react Tailwind CSS and Redux with
the help of Chad G in this tutorial we
are going to leverage the powerful
capabilities of Chad GPD to assist us in
building modern responsive and featur
Rich e-commerce application you will
learn how to set up your development
environment we will start by setting up
the essential tools and libraries
required for our project including react
Tailwind CSS Redux and react router we
are also going to design the application
layout using Tailwind CSS we will create
a visually appealing userfriendly layout
that includes the header navigation bar
product listings shopping cart and
checkout Pages we are also going to
implement the State Management with
Redux we will use Redux for managing
Global State ensuring our application is
scalable and maintainable you will learn
how to set up slices for handling user
authentication product data and the
shopping card we will also create
reusable components and throughout this
tutorial we will build a variety of
reusable components such as product
cards form inputs buttons and models to
enhance the modularity and reusability
of our code for fetching and managing
data we are going to use react query so
that we are going to fetch data from a
backend API and manage the server State
efficiently we will also learn to handle
loading States caching and
synchronization with react query with
that said guys watch this video till the
end if you want to learn how to make an
e-commerce application using chat G PD
so guys this is a website which we are
going to create with the help of chat
GPD so you can see all over here we have
the navigation bar which includes home
about products card okay so suppose I
want to add this product okay this is a
lamp and say I want to add in this
quantity say three and if I click it up
you can see there's a notification which
is coming up and it's saying item has
been added to the card now we can also
go and check the card but before uh
proceeding for check out you need to
also login so suppose I have not created
any account so let us create an account
so say this is a mail ID and say let us
take some demo mail ID and here is some
password
and you can say email is already taken
so let us give some random mail
suppose name atate 1 2 3 and say the
password is 1 2 3
4 okay now let's login so it's saying
email must be a valid email so I have
also put like we can say checkpoints
where if the proper validation of the
input field is also given so name adate
name 1 123 adate
gmail.com now I hope so it is going to
work so email or username has already
been taken so let us change our username
so username name 1 2 3 and let us try to
register so you can see all the input
validation has been done so let us give
some
big
okay now you can see it has completely
logged in okay so you can save the
password
now let us go to our
our
repeat so you can see I'm trying to log
in all over here and it's been logged in
okay so now you can see
if you click on our products you are
going to see the products part like
there's a chair there's a glass table
king bed size and all these are the
cards of the product so basically this
images have been taken from a link okay
I will mention you the link and you can
do it and inside this you can also
search the given product suppose say I
want I want to grade lamp or say chick
chair
okay if I type this and uh if I try to
search it you can see this is coming up
you can also select the company suppose
if I just see all over here so the
company name is luxora okay so you can
type all over there in the check box
okay so where the search button is
coming up and you can say all these
companies are there and with the help of
that you can search it you can also do
the Sorting from A to Z Z to a high to
low okay so this is all we are going to
build using reactjs daily CSS Redux and
also use some State Management and with
the help of Tailwind CSS we are going to
create a fully responsive website now
let's get started so guys let us open
our chat GPT and write a prompt so guys
the first prompt that I want to create
is that
say I am
creating a
tutorial or you can say I'm creating a
website using
reactjs and it's
an
e-commerce
website so we'll with the help
of or by using V okay Tailwind
CSS and
Redux now
the next thing what I have to tell the
GPT that can you help me outline the
agenda of this project like including
the main features and functionality okay
so this is the first thing and you can
see all over here so it says like
install and configure whe integrate
tailin CSS okay set up Redux then for
the uiu design it's saying responsive
layout okay then you have to do theme
and styling Define a consistent theme
okay now for authentication and user
management you have to do user
registration and login okay for product
management like product listing product
details and product search so we have
seen these functionalities that we have
implemented in our website and also you
can see there's a shopping card and
checkout option you have to add to the
card card management and checkout
process for the order management you can
also track the history and we are not
going to Target these two things okay
these are some of the additional
features but till here we are going to
complete it okay so not to complicate
too much just to give you a brief
outline how you can make a website using
CH GPT and Tailwind CSS and other tools
and
dependencies so like we have got the
brief idea regarding the main features
and functionalities so we have
responsive design user authentication
product catalog shopping cart checkout
process order management admin panel
wish list reviews and rating
notification and performance
optimization now let us write the next
part so here I'm going to type my next
prompt that will
be can you help me
explain the folder structure or can you
help me with the folder
structure of this react
e-commerce
app and
also let me
know the
purpose of each
folder so let us type this prompt and
uh we are getting some brief idea like
how our uh things would be there so it
says like you can see the folder
structure first we have to create a
folder called e-commerce app okay and
then so guys for this I will have an
assets folder okay then we are going to
create a components folder inside the
components there are going to be various
components okay so let us start with
that and let us first set up our
development
environment so guys I'm using vs code as
our text editor and in that let us see
that you have first all the dependencies
installed like node especially with the
help of node we are going to install the
package for creating the react app so
guys uh you can also type all over here
that uh how to set up my
development
environment and if you type this command
you can see so there are certain
prerequisites it's going to tell like
node and npm code editor visual code so
like you have to create a certain thing
like this npm create Ved latest my
e-commerce app then template and then
you can go in this app so since I've
already created an e-commerce app so
what I'm going to do uh inside this I'm
going to create this and uh let us copy
this all over here so you can see assets
I have already created and uh let us go
to the terminal click on view and here's
a terminal and here let's type this
click on
yes so all the necessary dependencies is
going to install so you can see all over
here like what I have to choose it says
pre- react Lit C solids or other so you
you can just select all over here that I
want to use a react
version
okay just click on this and let us keep
the JavaScript part all over here and
you can see this has already been
created now the second would be go to
our e-commerce app so this is your
folder navigate to
this and next type npm
install and finally click on okay it's
installing the node modules we are going
to wait for some
time so guys as I have asked GPT all
over here give me the folder structure
for our component
so you can see all over here it has
given card item card item list card
totals checkout forms complex
imagination container and it has given
error element feature products then for
filtering it has given for filter. JS
form checkbox form input okay form range
form select header hero loading nav bar
nav links order list imagination
container product container then product
grid is there product list is there then
section title and you can also learn
about the process or what do you say the
purpose for each component okay all over
here now like product grid what it does
so you can ask GPT the same question
with a prompt like what is the purpose
of this uh given component so you can
see it is going to tell you all over
here so guys use it excessively wherever
you fill out and it has also given the
code all over here okay now before that
since I've told you we'll be using using
Tailwind CSS so now let us type the
command to set up our Tailwind CSS so
type
uh I want to set
up the Tailwind
CSS in my uh
project uh help
uh uh give me
the G type
okay so if you typee this so you it is
going to see that first you have to
install the Tailwind CSS and its
dependencies so guys for the same
purpose uh just copy this all over here
come to your folder so now click it all
over here that npm installed the post
CSS Auto prefixer so it is going to
start the downloading part of it okay
the next process is in the step two you
have to initialize the Tailwind CSS so
copy this and go all over here
and let us initialize our Tailwind CSS
pretty fine what is the next step guys
in the next process we have to configure
our Tailwind
CSS so you can see all over here there
is going to be a file called tailwind
config.js and you can configure
it all over
here so let us go in our file and you
can see Twi config.js would be there so
okay so now we have done this now let us
see what is the third thing in the step
four it is saying add the Tailwind
directive to your CSS file okay so
there's going to be a file okay first
you have to create a CSS file for your
Tailwind Styles okay and in that you
have to add these directives okay so
guys this is our index. CSS file and we
can also add the directives all way here
just click on everything and delete it
and and just add the required directives
okay so I have added this part now let
us move to the next part so in your app.
CSS you have to import it okay so
whenever you are going to open our
app.js file so here we have app. j6 so
you can see we are importing this okay
all over here and in our main. j6 file
you can see our index. CSS is imported
so basically this file is already been
imported all over here okay which is
basically going to apply the Tailwind
CSS directives that we are going to use
while building our components now let us
build our components one by one okay so
you have seen all over here that uh our
folder structure was something like this
okay so we have card items card item
list card totals checkout forms complex
pagination container error element
featured products filter form checkbox
and form input form range header so let
me create all these folder for you so
we'll go all over
here now click on the new folder and say
components pretty fine now here we have
to create all the files so guys you can
see all over here I have created all the
components in the meantime so I have
card items card item list card totals
checkout forms complex pagination
container error element featured
products filters form checkbox form
input and many
so the same thing which chart GPT has
given me I have created all these things
okay these are the basic things and uh
while also creating a website I would
also recommend you to understand like
how these components which are usable
throughout the process have been used
okay now let us ask chat GPD to populate
this okay now this thing has been done
now let us ask for Pages like what pages
I want to make in our website so if I
navigate to our website we can see we
have homepage we have about page we have
a products page we have a card checkout
and orders so let us ask GPD the
same I want to create
Pages for
about
home
card
checkout error
okay
orders then we have the home
layout
login
register
single product page
okay so like these things you have to
identify or the best thing you can do it
you can take the screenshot of this okay
so take uh like all everything you can
just take a picture okay snap it up and
send it to chat gbt it is also going to
recognize it and let me show you this
okay so say I'm going to snip it up so
say I want to say I want to create these
pages
[Music]
and you can just take an image and just
paste it up so you can see the image is
going to get pasted and you can type a a
prompt something like this that I want
to create Pages like this which includes
home card checkout orders home layout
login register single product page and
you can also ask GPT to give a Tailwind
CSS for these things so GPT is going to
answer you for the same but as a
developer you can take this help but
don't rely over it too much you have to
also do little bit of modification by
yourself so this thing I have written
and let us click it so so first it is
telling you to install the react rout to
D okay so now you have to install this
so copy
this okay so you can see in your
package.json file so this will our
package.json
all over here and you can see all over
here that we have dependencies all
installed which is react router
D so you can see all over here its
version is 6.2 4.1 now the most
important part like while using this
project so what dependencies I have used
all over here so I'm going to give a
brief idea regarding this so guys for
building this project you are going to
require these dependencies like you need
to have Redux toolkit you need to have
tank stank you need to have react query
dep tools okay you need to have an xos
you need to have a DJs react react Dom
react icons we'll be using you going to
use react Redux for State man management
react rout to Dom react toasttify then
there are certain de dependencies as you
can see Tailwinds typography we have to
use because what kind of text we are
going to put it up on our web page so
this is going to handle it then we are
going to use types types react Dom then
V plug-in okay this we have it Daz UI
okay esent then we have esent plug-in
react hooks then we are going to use
post CSS Tailwind CSS and V so what we
can do next you can copy all these
things okay so since I've already copied
now let us go to our GPT and
say uh give me the
command
to
install these
dependencies so you can see all over
here it has given me all these commands
and just going to go our uh text editor
so here's our
terminal and just type
this and you can see all over here it is
going to start the process of installing
all these packages similarly you have to
install all the da
dependencies now the best thing is that
uh what are the dependencies required I
will share you in the given video and
you can install it and also for the de
dependencies similarly you have to do it
just copy it and go all over here and
paste
it and you can see all the da
dependencies are going to be added in
your package.json file okay since we
have used it
now these were the given components and
these were some of the pages okay now
let us create the pages that we have
discussed before
and also guys uh you can see assets all
over here you have to transfer this all
over here here okay now I'm going to do
this but before that let's create the
pages section so create a new folder
called Pages all over here
and inside the pages you can see all
over here that for Pages we have told
all about here that they going to be
home layout they are going to be error.
jsx they're going to be a checkout and
about. jsx okay all over here and in
similarly just create this now for each
of the given page you can check all over
here that it is giving an idea about it
that you can have to ensure something
like this and also you can ask GPT to
explain you what we are going to use it
okay so see here all the headers you're
going to add the links like about card
checkout orders login register so which
is basically there on our navigation
panel and similarly for applying the CSS
just ask GPT to make it something like
this provide a proper spacing and also
you can take a screenshot of this and
send it to gbt so it is going to analyze
it and give you the required code for
this okay but the most important part is
you need to identify what folder
structure that you have to use it and
don't worry guys I will share the
required doc file in the description
where you can check what are the
components that we have made and
similarly you can take the help of GPT
and build this project so guys I have
created all the required pages and you
can see all over here that we have about
card checkout error for handling the
errors okay home layout index. jss
Landing login orders product management
error for handling the errors throughout
like 404 page then we have the landing
page we have the login orders products
register then we have the single
product. jsx so these are the required
pages that we need to build in order to
replicate the website okay so if you
have any problem like what this given
page does just ask the GPT and it's is
going to give you the required answer
now this was building our project
structure for the second part now let us
move to the third part now guys the next
thing which I want to do all over here
is that I want to create a utility
folder which is kind of reusable
throughout the application and it has
these functionalities a custom fetch
okay which means a pre-configured axio
axio basically which is going to have an
axio instance for making standardized
API calls and also to the back server
then we have the format price
functionality in which we are going to
use the utility function to format the
numerical prices that we are using while
buying the given product and also in a
USD currency format okay so it's
basically a dollar format okay and then
generate amount options then also we are
need to create a utility function to
generate the list of quantity options
for a selected drop down okay so these
were all the features that I've shown
you all over here so when you go from
this suppose say on this given product
and if you select this say add to the
back say I want seven of them and when
you go to your given card so you can see
all over here the format pricing and all
the utility fun repeat and all the
utility functions used all over here are
given so you can see GPT has given so it
has given custom fetch format price
generate amount option. JS you can
create three of them but I will not
complicate this instead of this since
the application is pretty simple I will
put all of these things under one folder
so guys as you can see all over here I
have created a folder called utils
folder and with a name called index. jsx
and inside this I'm going to add all the
three functionalities which I have told
you now and this was the project
structure that we need to build in order
to make an application like that now
what you can do guys now you can see the
functionality of this all over here okay
now since you'll not get an access to
this website what you can also do you
can create a demo website like this or
you can take a picture of this and send
to GPT it is going to give you the
required idea like how you can proceed
to build the project so it is very very
helpful but at the end of the day you
need to know about react little bit so
that you can modify the application
based on the given instances so guys in
inside our my e-commerce app you can see
our project structure is set up so
inside the SRC we have the assets so I
have pasted these images okay so if you
click on this so it is going to show you
these kind of images so I'll share you
the link for the assets you can use this
to create this website for the same you
have components and all the components
like card items card items totals
checkout forms form checkbox hero
loading nav Lings is all been mentioned
so this is for all the components that
we'll be needing to build this website
for the required Pages we have about
card checkout error home layout Landing
login orders product registers and
single product okay these are the
required pages and one we have the
utility folder all over here that we
have created called index. js6 for
handling these custom
functionalities now this was the basic
idea regarding the project structure now
what you can do guys since you have got
an idea like what components we'll be
using so ask GPT okay now build each of
the components by using this prompt uh
say now help me uh I want
to make
the give me the code or you can ask
something like this uh give me
the code for card
component
and with
the required
Tailwind CSS configuration the Tailwind
CSS
Snippets or you can say with the
Tailwind CSS
code now if you type this all over here
so it is going to give you a demo idea
okay suppose you have this cart jsx and
cart item. jsx so you can see all over
here it has started using this CSS which
is basically a Tailwind CSS and I know
it on the first time you're not going to
get exactly the same you wanted so on it
what you can do guys that you can take a
picture like what the output is coming
and send it to GPD and ask it to you
have to ask for each of the components
similarly ask for the pages okay so ask
like something like this so based on
the project structure based on the pages
so guys as you can see all over here so
guys it has started giving the codes for
the respective Pages as you can see all
over here and with the respective
Tailwind CSS you can definitely modify
it based on your choices and also what
you feel like is more responsive and
user friendly for getting an in-depth
idea regarding Tailwind CSS you can
navigate to its official
document and it will be very very
helpful that you can also take a help
and ask GPT the same thing so after you
have populated these pages with the
respective codes and components okay
that we have shared all over here next
thing what you can do all the way here
that just type all way here that this
command or you can ask GPT how
to run my
application give me the command you can
type this and it is going to give you
the command but I know the command that
is npm run de or this is the given
command that is will be very helpful for
running your application so at each
stage suppose you're are building one
component so keep running this and keep
seeing like what changes you are
applying on a real time so building an
application using react or any front-end
application is a hit and trial So based
on the modifications that you require so
you have to consistently interact with
GPT and make an application out of it
but this was an overview of our given
thing so just type this all over here so
just type this and your application is
going to start on a given Port so this
is your Port 5174 so if you navigate all
over here so your application will be
open so let me show you like suppose the
port which I'm using all over here so it
is 5173 okay so this will be your
application and in this way you can make
an application with the help of Chad gbt
so I've given you the basic idea and I
will also share the given documents for
the components pages so that you could
have a brief idea and you can ask the
GPT to give the required ta CSS for the
same I will also share the assets you
can use it or you can download the
assets from various other websites where
they have like free pick where you can
make the images for the given products
like you can say lamp coffee table Cofe
W which are easily available and you can
start designing all these things so guys
the best thing about GPT 40 that you can
also share the image so with the help of
this you can definitely build an
application as technology advances in
all aspects of Our Lives programming has
become increasingly important it is used
in many fields and industries including
software development gaming and
entertainment education scientific
research web development and many more
so needless to say the demand for
programming and coding in the IT
industry will probably keep increasing
for the foreseeable future but where
does chatut open ai's popular language
model fall in this chain that's exactly
what we are focusing on in this today's
video as I said earlier programming is
utilized in many domains like web
development robotics mobile development
machine learning and so on so how can a
program achieve maximum code efficiency
nowadays we have eii based tools like
charab to make our programming
experience more efficient although there
are several coding resources platforms
such as tack overflow and GitHub where
programmers can find solutions to their
technical programming questions charity
stands out from the competition because
of its quick response time usability and
support for numerous languages among
many other benefits now let's first
discuss how charity Works charity
generates responses to the text input
using a method called Transformer
architecture a large volume of text is
fed into the chat GP from various
sources including books websites and
other social media platforms the model
then uses this information to forecast
the following word in a phrase based on
the words that came before it the ch
systems allows users to enter text or
queries and then the system uses its
training data and algorithms to produce
the right answer the answer is created
after the input text has been examined
and the pattern most likely to match the
input have been identified using the
training data in short charity is
designed to respond to queries logically
and command more quickly and accurately
but why do programmers use charab on a
regular basis tagab assists programmers
by offering programming related answers
and solutions and helping them improve
their skills beside that charity is
utilized for code generation code
completion code review and a natural
language interface let us understand
each in detail chip is trained to
generate the code or even the entire
program described in the natural
language specified by what they want a
program to do and then charity could
generate the relevant code look at the
example of how Char generates the code
so now open the Char GPT and you can
type any program that you want charp to
generate so I will give write a palum
program in Java so here you can type
write
a
palum program in
Java so using Java programming language
it should generate the whole
program so as you can see it has
generated the program so it has used a
class name called pandrum Checker and it
has used e palum as a method name and
also it will give the explanation on the
program so you can see here why it is
explaining why e pandrum is used as a
method and U it also explains the for
Loop if a condition and so on next we
have code completion Char is trained to
generate Snippets of code or even fully
fledged programs it can generate a list
of possible code completion depending on
the context of the users incomplete
piece of Code by automatically producing
the entire code it can help the
developers save time and minimize errors
next let's see the example of code
completion using chpt so even if the
program is explained in natural language
CH GP will generate the proper code and
give the complete code so let's type
here using a
function write a
program to convert
the
string in
uppercase so using which language let's
keep using C
programming and enter it once
again so as you can see we have just
said that using a function write a
program to convert the string in
uppercase so using C programming
language and using C programming
language it has used function and you
know this is the function convert to
uppercase and has given the complete
code for string or to convert a string
in uppercase and also it gave the
explanation here the convert to
uppercase function takes a pointer to a
string as its argument and then iterates
over each character in the string using
a for Loop so it explained why for Loop
is used why two upper is used and why
the method convert to uppercase is used
everything so let's say uh we give one
piece of code like
void to
Upper car s
Str so as you can see we just gave the
method to Upper and it's generating the
complete code so this is how charp works
for code completion next code review
charity can analyze code identify the
bugs or errors in the program and
further help resolve them it allows
developers to fix errors more quickly so
now let's have a look at the example of
code review so in this example Char will
review the code so even if the code has
some mistake it will give the proper
output let's say we have given the
example here so we give the function or
a method called
upper and here we are giving the keyword
called upper so it should check whether
this piece of code is proper or is there
any mistake in
this so as I said uh it's saying that
the given code appears to have logical
error as the function upper is being
called recursively on itself inside the
loop so instead of giving two upper we
just give upper here right so using the
keyword to Upper only then the string
can be converted to uppercase so here we
gave just upper so it says that it is
having this piece of code is having a
logical eror and it gives a proper code
for
us so I hope it's clear and then we have
natural language interface with the use
of chipt a software application can be
given a natural language user interface
that enables users to communicate with
it through natural language instructions
rather than through conventional user
interfaces next let's see how AG helps
the programmers for natural language
interface so let's say we'll give
here
create a software
application
where the
user asked to
enter
credential for the too
app enter
so as you can see the Char will give the
steps so it can provide you with an
outlet for creating a software
applications that requires the user to
enter credential for a to-do app so here
it is few steps that we need to follow
to do a to-do app
so it's giving the explanation step by
step so it says that determine the
programming language and framework then
set up the database to store the user
information and then create the
registration page and then finally
create the login page as well and once
the user is successfully logged in um
you know it will have the options like
add edit and delete task as well and
then finally implement the security
measures to you know protect your
passwords and then test the application
to ensure that it works as intendent and
the user data is being stored and
retrieved correctly so it gives the
steps of how it has to be developed I'm
sure you all are aware of Charity at
this point the Revolutionary new aib
based chatbot developed by open AI has
taken the World by storm thanks to its
near lifik responses and a very
intricate pattern of answers we have
never seen this level of expertise from
a chatbot before which really made us
think to what extent can we push it
there are many questions on lead code
that even the most experienced
programmers have difficulty answering so
we wanted to see how far chat gity can
take us have we finally reached the
stage where AI is going to Place us
let's find out so basically here we will
be listing 10 really difficult questions
that we found on lead code popularly
asked while hiring and other Superior
examinations and see if chat GPD can
actually answer or solve those difficult
questions or not but before you like to
watch more such interesting videos then
do subscribe to our YouTube channel and
hit the Bell icon to never miss an
update from Simply learn so let's get
started so here is the lead code let's
see uh in our list which is the first
question that we are going to implement
in our chart GPD and see if it's able to
solve it or not mainly we'll focus on
hard category questions only
so according to my research there's a
question of
median of two sorted
arrays so as you can see the success
rate is 3 5.7% so let's see if the chart
GPD is able to do this question so first
let us go through the
question
okay press enter let's see what it first
returns
uh on a one approach to solving this
problem is to use a modified binary
search algorithm to find the median of
the two sorted arras so right now it's
particularly giving the logic which we
can actually imply to solve this
question and uh this is a good about the
chart GPD is that before uh giving the
code it's actually explaining how they
are putting the logic in together in the
code so probably you can use this logic
to create your own program but let's see
how sensible this code
is quite a lendy
program in Python so if uh you are
looking for your Solutions on chat GPD
you can always opt out or you know
mention the specific program you want
the code in so okay it's it's also gives
that okay that the time complexity will
will be o log Min m or n so let's see if
it the case or
not so we have copied it and we'll
quickly paste it over
here as you can
see uh as we know that python is uh very
sensitive towards its uh syntax and you
can see the indentation over here is
perfect but here it's not so I feel that
something like this is something with
lead code so let me just quickly Rectify
this you can see I have cleared out the
indentation issue and let's just quickly
run this program so that we can get an
idea if this is the correct
program uh now you can see here we have
an error let's see copy this and see
what CH GPD has to say for this
if you remember when we actually saw
this question there were three arguments
passed through this function which was
self nums one and nums 2 ask GPT if it
can write the code with self argument
and see if it's correct
wait that if it can pass a self argument
through that function and see if it can
generate a new
code okay now it has cleared that yes it
takes three
arguments
let's this
code it over here again I think we will
have to go through the indentation
process oh no this time it's fine okay
so now quickly run this program let's
see if this time it passes all the test
cases or
not
okay I think it doesn't need because the
class is already mentioned over
here uh
yeah okay the run time is 35 Ms and as
we can see case one and case two is
definitely passed
so let us see
if this Bood can pass all the test cases
internally mentioned in this question
now you can see the first three cases
are actually accepted but the other
three are not there's a runtime
error
so the first question in our list Jad
GPT was unable to solve let's move on to
our next question
that is zigzag
conversion now let me quickly search for
it this is a question here also you can
see the success rate is definitely below
50 and uh the difficulty level is medium
so the hard one charge was not able to
solve let's see if this can be done
so it will give a string that will be
written in a zigzag pattern on a given
number of rows and uh then you have to
read the line in a certain as you can
see over
here we have to write the code that will
take a string and make this conversion
given in a number of
row this also means a certain amount of
certific uh repeat do also given a
certain specifications that we exactly
want so this time we'll make sure that
we are mentioning
everything so let's quickly copy
this yeah
okay now that we have mentioned all the
specifications uh let me
quickly
feed speed and feed pasted now let's see
what code it has to
generate it's implementing the code in
C++ so meanwhile it's generating the
code let's
quickly like the code oh it's already
C++ okay
okay it's also suggesting that we can
definitely use Python and
Java and it's generating an alternative
code as well for
us that's
sharp just quickly copy this
code a one I think it's a okay so it's
generating in uh
Java it's generating we'll definitely
have a look at its alternative codes as
well let's quickly have a look at what
it has to C++ one the first code
generated by it uh is correct or
not okay copy the
code pasted over
here dilation
error okay
okay 28
okay so
let's this
error one thing definitely this time we
have mentioned all the constraints
criteria specifications that we wanted
in a code but again
charging questions we have implemented
till
now let's see if it has any success rate
in further
okay it seems
okay now it is okay so this time it is
uh generating the
solution considering the error in
Java uh see what it has to say St in
Java and we'll make it specific that the
error was in C++ program so generates
the correct
code Plus+ program
what it has to
say see so this error is something
related to the compiler and now it is
giving the updated code in
C++ is the correct one or
not she apologizing for making errors in
their
Solutions quite
fascinating
uh yeah
paste the code over here I don't see
there's a lot of difference or changes
over here let's see if it runs or
not let me see if all the braces are
covered over here or not
I think it's missing a brace
okay so there was a syntax error one
brace was
missing um I
don't about that
definitely something with the code but
okay we can give that to chat GB it was
partially lead codes issue because we
were copying still it was not giving the
error that there is a brace
missing has passed the first three cases
mentioned over here and the run time is
3 Ms now just let us submit this code
and see if it passes all the rest of the
cases or not
minded this time we have actually
mentioned all the constraints so let's
see if this has
into okay so this time it has passed all
the test cases but still my conclusion
with this question is uh it was still
not able to generate the solution in one
go uh but still I can give that to
charge GPT because the first eror that
we faced was more of a lead cses issue
because it was something with
compile and chat GPT was able to give a
proper U now let's go back to our
problems
list so right now the score is one in
one it was unable to solve one question
and one not so let's have a look at the
third question and see if that brings
any difference to the char g Li's
scoreboard right now or
not third question that we are going to
deal with is
substring
with concatenation of all
words this is in the category again and
the success success rate is
31.1% which is even lesser than the
first question that we faced which was
median of the two sorted
AR we trying here we are actually trying
to cover all the Spectra the huge
Spectra of different types of questions
and you know categories available in
coding and uh to give you an idea of
how beneficial charge can be for you to
solve difficult questions which can be
helpful for your interview basee in
companies or you you can say well
established companies or mang companies
so here this video is specifically for
you to give an idea that whether you can
use it for your benefit and you know to
get an idea or you can actually uh
compare it with
yours uh and you can get a you know
wider range of different types of
approaches to a certain question
so let's start with the third
question is that you're given a string
and an array of strings probably words
and all the strings of words are of the
same length now a concatenated substring
in s is a substring that contains all
the strings of any permutation of words
concatenated
here you can see it's given an example
that if words has AB b c d EF then AB CD
EF basically it uh has done all the
permutation and combinations that can be
done using that specific
array
uh and that AC CD BF is not a
concatenated substring because it is not
the concatenation of any permutation of
words so we have to basically return the
starting indices of all the concatenated
substring in the S
string also you can choose any order for
it here it has also given uh two
examples for you
to understand the question in a better
perspective
now uh copy this question and see
if what programming language ajib
chooses to answer this time
start with new chart
again copy these constraints
okay it's just a
question okay this is the solution that
we're getting right now you requested a
model that is not compatible with this
engine please contact us through our
help center at
help. open.com for further questions let
me just quickly refresh it if it has
something to do with the you know demand
also sometimes it happens that the
console is very busy and you're unable
to
implement uh your task in it so again
let's
quickly paste it over
here we want a code write a code
return
now PR
enter I'm definitely it's not giving the
same error let's see it this time it
Char has anything to give as as a
solution okay so it's generating the
code in
Python more thing every time charge
doesn't follows a similar pattern as you
can see in the first question it
explained the logic first and uh then
implemented the code
second time it just gave you the
approach not the logic and then
implemented the code in multiple
languages uh first choosing for
C++ and this time it straightway went
for the code so definitely we can say
that it has some different styles of
generating their code and explaining the
code I think it depends on the
understanding how they want the code to
be presented in front of the user and to
give the perspective that if the code is
understandable or not and if the code
has multiple approaches I think charity
is capable to capable enough to give
that that the code is generated let's
quickly copy
it
and paste it over
here I feel the indentation issue is
going to be
there it was not
there okay
F probably but I think if we back
space isue let me quickly Rectify this
and
I'll you once the indentations
are
e
e
e e
the indentation is so corrected now uh
let's have a look at the code if it's
correct or not let's quickly run
it definitely it has given our first
synex error again I can see that even
specific video question it definitely
goes to at least one error which is
mainly the syntax one
sure if that is something with the lead
code or you know with
the chart GPT code
generation
okay that we have given the error okay
it seems that the error is caused by the
use of type hints the function type
hints where introduced the version we
are using is lower than that okay so
basically it's generating now in the
python version uh probably this code
is well suited for different version of
python let's change it then and see if
that helps
it is actually generating the
code okay again given the other I think
it's again something with the
self
uh one the new code generated is
here we definitely come back to that
error and have a look at the Python 3
code also uh first let's copy this code
and e
in giving the same
[Music]
error and see what it has to
say uh you know every time the Char
generates the python code we
cannot ever take self as an argument
but as you can see when we start the
code it's already mentioned what
arguments we need to pass from that
particular function so I think that is
something with the lead code
so that what all arguments it's passing
even though we have mentioned everything
this time we have mentioned all the
constraints we have mentioned all all
the uh
necessary specifications that we want in
the code even then the code is not
correct in the one go so probably I'll
get this point to GPD it's something
with the lead code because it's passing
that parameter and everything we have to
mention that parameter pretty much when
we do the charity is able to solve the
question so let's see what let me U
actually mention that
pass uh self parameter self argument
from that parameters one of make it a
one of the parameters
processing
that yes self can be passed as the first
argument to the given function now let's
see if that it's able to give the
correct solution or not again we can see
it's uh generating the code in you
know Pon 3 but we can give that to CH
GPD that either it uses python or Python
3 the error is with the self argument so
once we mention that error and when we
mentioned that specification that if CH
GP can pass self argument through that
particular function in that code the
solution is pretty
much right so here it's also
implementing and giving the
answer okay it also has mentioned that
uh it's important to mention import
imported list and counter so okay
just copy this because again there will
be a lot of uh ination
issues okay now that we have
it let copy the
code already mentioned so yeah we'll
just
copy it from the
[Music]
function paste it
run this code and see if it has the
solution in it or
not yeah there's an indentation
issue let me
again as you can see it is able to pass
all the test cases here and the run time
is 28
Ms now let us submit this question and
see if it is able to pass other test
cases or
not accepted so it is able to pass all
the test cases and uh I I think this is
something with lead code again uh
whenever we are generating the python
code we are actually passing self
argument uh in lead code but chart GPD
is not assuming it so this solution is
definitely correct uh even though we are
specifying everything we will have to be
more specific that we have to run one
more argument uh from the function so
that it you know generates the solution
in one go so let us uh try that in our
next
question we can definitely see chart jbd
was able to solve this so now the
scoreboard is 2 and one uh among the
three questions it is definitely able to
solve two questions even the first
question it was able to generate a
correct solution but it was not that
accurate to pass all the test cases
to our question
list the next we are going to cover is
in
Queens category but still the success
rate is 63% over here again a new genre
of question we are covering over here
let us see if
solve it or not definitely the success
rate shows that many people were able to
do it definitely more than half of
people who have attempted it so let's
see if the question can this AI can beat
that or
not so uh I have copied this question
this question mentions that the nend
Queens puzzle is the problem of placing
n Queens on an n n to n chest board such
that no two queens attack each other
given an integer n return all distinct
solutions to the n Queen puzzle so
basically n is any given number and you
have to create a puzzle of n into n and
you have to arrange all the Queens in
such uh you know way also the number of
Queens in the board will be equal to the
number and in such a way that it is not
able to attack each other in any
case po it this part of the
question and the constraint is just one
let
me that it will be easier to keep a
track of uh what all questions Char gbt
is able to solve
so these questions are very popular uh
in
interviews uh whenever you actually go
to technical rounds and uh for
prestigious companies these questions
are very popular uh they are considered
as very uh suitable questions to check
uh to check your you know IQ and to
check your potential that how well aware
you are towards your coding
potential that we have pressed enter it
is giving the logic it is going to
implement in its code one approach to
solve the end Queen's puzzle is to use
backtracking idea is to start by placing
a queen in the First Column of the first
row so let's see if the code is again
capable to you know solve it or not
again it's giving the python
code generating the code let us quickly
see whether it's python or Python
3 Python
3
okay once the code is generated I'll
also write that you need to pass one
more argument from the main
function uh that is self and uh let let
it generate the code again and see that
code can run in one go or not
what I want and let us see sure here's
an example of how you can pass an
additional parameter self let's see if
it suits
the code or not
the solve and queen function is a method
of the N Queen's class and it takes self
as its first parameter followed by the
integer n so yes this solution does take
self as a parameter so let's see if this
can run in one go or not because this
time we have already covered the most uh
frequently generated error which is synx
error of not mentioning parameter self
so let me see the indentation if it's
correct or
not this time uh let us quickly run this
L okay there you go now you can see that
it has actually run the code in one go
and all the test cases are passed in one
go even the run time is 39 Ms so so
definitely chat gbt is able to provide
the solutions Logics in a proper manner
it's just that we have to be more
specific with what we want exactly uh
from chat GB right now we can see that
it has been able to successfully
generate of five uh questions that we
have actually implemented till now out
of which four are from hard
category let us submit this code and see
if it also covers all the test cases
inter internally fed in for this
question just a second I think I will
have to submit it
again there you go it has accepted all
the test cases and this question is done
by CH GPT it has actually
implemented next question that we are
going to cover till now I can say RGB
has taken the lead it is pretty much
able to implement all the questions uh I
think there are still some range of
questions that it is not able to
implement as we saw the first one was
not a huge
success but uh I can still give that to
char as it is in Ai and still in a you
know developing mode but still if it can
give you 90% of the output correct it is
a pretty decent and you know amazing
thing to
do question is shortest subar with some
at least K now let me search for it
again this question is from heart
category and its success rate is even
low which is 26.1 let's see this
question can be solved by Char
gpt's have a look at the question given
an integer AR nums and an integer K
return the length of the shortest
non-empty subarray of nums with a sum of
at least K so if there is no such subar
return minus
one
so AR is a continuious part of an array
it has also given a description of what
an array is or what sub array is so now
that we
have a new
chat and let
me change
so here is one way to solve the problem
initialize to pointers uh left and right
both pointing to the first element of
the array initialize a variable so now
this time this it is giving pointers to
solve this question uh you know a
perfect approach in a quential manner so
that you can also use these pointers and
the Logics it's giving to actually
Implement your own code apart from you
know asking it to generate a
code I can see that it has given the
pointers but not the code specific
yes uh it's giving an implementation of
the algorithm in
Python uh again we can see it's not the
Python 3 it's python uh little lower
version of python
um switch
to
python then we have to pass self
so it has generated a code and explained
what all VAR and what statements have
the individual fun functionality as so
we have also asked it to pass self
parameter through its function and then
write the code so let's see if it aderes
to it and generates new code with self
parameter okay so
here is the new code with s par pass to
the main function
now I do have confidence on chat GPT
till now that it was able to generate
logical and you know pretty decent
solutions for every
question this pass to the class as an
argument when an object is created and
is stored as an instance variable the
shortest subar takes K as an argument
which is the target sum
so basically it's trying to explain the
code that what exactly it's doing and
what individual statements have as an
influence on the
code and whatever parameters they are
passing what influence or what position
they hold in the
code uh definitely charge abity is not
just generating the code uh you know
it's also explaining the logic and
approaches towards it
and when it's generating the code as you
can see here they have legit explained
the whole code how it's actually
functioning that's a good way to you
know
put emphasis on you know put a
confidence on the
solution remove this
yeah H eror okay let me
okay so it's apologizing it made a
mistake in its previous response the
init method should take two arguments
one for the nums array and one for KY so
now it's again generating a new code
ading to the synx error or type error
generated
let's right or not
mentioned that here the method takes two
arguments one for the nums array and one
for the G which was the error
exactly and it's again explaining the
whole code so that one person who
watches code or you know the logic could
understand the functionality of it
let's see if this code can
run checking for indentation removing
class and
run is one more type error
let's copy it
and we mention that we want self
argument to be
passed it is still not able to
generate you know the correct solution
twice so let's see if this time it can
work out
though with the
code apologize for the confusion seems
that I misunderstood
the that you are trying to call the
function directly without creating an
instance of the class in that function
outside of the class and simply Call It
by passing the parameters like this okay
the code is definitely generated by
itself definitely I am not calling any
function uh the code I copied was
actually generated by chart GPD itself
so it contradicting its own pointers
maybe that we have copied the question
uh sorry the code let's paste
it again look for indentation
and run this
code okay once again it is not able to
you know
pass I error is there now again we have
to copy this error and
tasted again according to chat J it was
confused with the context of the
question
uh like I said the code was anywh
generated by chart GPT so yeah this time
I think chart GPT is trying to
contradict its own
Logics let's see if the current code can
do the miracle of solving this question
[Music]
CL and
run okay so after four attempts of
running the codes generated by chart GP
on lead code but this particular
question finally now it's able to pass
all the test cases so I can I have a
very contradicting point right now uh
not exactly contradicting more of a
skeptism that okay Chad gity does
generates uh proper code or logic but it
doesn't
considers all the criterias or it also
has a tendency of taking the question in
a wrong
context so I feel that when we as a
human try to solve these questions we
definitely try to implement all the
Logics and if we get it we can actually
get the code in one
go or you know demand of the question
and be AI being the superior version or
you know trying to be the superior
version of human brain and going to the
extents of a human
brain still faces those issues can be a
you know drawback for chat GPT because
you can see for this specific question
we have faced multiple types of error
and we have seen chity contradicting its
own prior code
so definitely this is something to
consider or you know something to think
about
submit this
code and like I said after giving four
attempts it is still not able to pass
all the test cases it is only able to
six pass 61 out of 97 test
cases which is almost 70% of the test
cases 30% of the test cases are still
not passed even though we mentioned all
the constraints we have mentioned the
comments we have mentioned all the
errors that this particular code can go
through still it was not able to
generate the proper code that could go
through all the test cases so this was a
fail for Char GPT uh at least till now
we have made out this point that Char
GPT is definitely not able to solve
every
question
question array with same
average
right
let AR with
this is from the category of heart
questions and the success rate is only
25% uh Let me refresh it and remove this
code now let's have a look at the code
what it demands so you are given an
integer AR nums now you should move each
element of nums into one of the two
arrays A and
B and B are non empty and average of
array a is equal to average of array B
now return true if it is possible to
achieve
that condition is not
justified Al given a note that for an
array uh average array is the sum of all
the elements of array over the length of
array okay so it it is giving the logic
of how to actually you know find out the
average of what average is exactly
and also it has given a few examples to
give you idea how the code needs to be
projected or
implemented pleas copy the code and
paste it
okay it is possible to achieve this by
checking all the possible subsets of the
nums array and comparing the averages of
the subsets so definitely it has given
you the approach uh the way you can
actually think of solving this question
uh however this approach would have a
Time complexity so it's also giving that
this approach can have a Time complexity
of O to the power uh in so again it's
suggesting a different approach a more
efficient approach that will be using
dynamic programming now that can be used
to find the subsets with a specific
average and create a 2d array with the
length of I and J will that will be the
length of the two we have actually given
as input and represents whether or not
it is possible to get a sum of J using
the first elements of the nums aray
[Music]
so so the time complexity of this
approach would be o n s so definitely is
not given a code let me ask for
it but not for every question chat GPT
is generating a code it is also
mentioning just and the approaches that
we can actually use uh definitely again
we will have to mention that what we
want from
them as you can see I've mentioned this
time to write a code for it and now it's
generating a new code for it
is also mentioning comments that what
every snippet of the code is actually
for and what it will do like here you
can see it will fill the 2dr DP uh DP
stands for dynamic programming this here
it has mentioned initialize the First
Column as true so it is also mentioning
the comments for better idea of you know
understanding the code in a better
way also giving the note that this
implementation assumes that the nums
array is non empty and that the elements
of the nums array are non- negative
inures okay also the above
implementation will return the possible
subset that can be formed by the array
to fulfill the given condition and not
Pion true and false but that's what we
want exactly right uh still okay let us
this approach is in Python so let's copy
this and see this code can run or not
I can clearly see that again it needs to
pass
self uh
parameter indentation
give it a heads up
or I have mentioned what I want
specifically uh sure here is an example
of how you can pass the self parameter
so now the current solution will pass
self
okay there was an air okay
in and it has generated a new code uh
considering the criteria I just
mentioned that I need self parameter to
be passed through the function can
parip so I have copied it and let's
quickly paste it over
here uh you know pass all the cases and
not wait uh we need to remove
this okay it's done Now quickly just run
this
program okay so here is uh error
attribute error solution object has no
attribute okay so let me copy it and
paste it over here and see what chat gbt
has to say about this
error okay the error message solution
object has no attribute
uh split array same average suggest that
there is no method named with this in
the solution class so it is likely that
the test case is trying to call this
method but it does not exist in your
implementation anyway that I have not
mentioned this method this was given by
chart GP itself so again we can see the
condition that it is contradicting its
own so again it has generated new
response and it says that it should
resolve the issue and the test case
should be able to call this particular
method
correctly so that is something for us to
decide now let us copy this code and see
but now is it able to run or not and
pass all the test cases or
not and click on run
okay now the new generated response does
works for this particular question and
the runtime is 12 Ms and it th passes
the first two cases mentioned so let us
quickly submit this code and see if code
is perfectly you know fine to deal with
all the test cases actually fed by lead
code okay now again we can see one more
situation that this code is not able to
pass all the test cases even though we
mentioned all the specifications
constraints and we were pretty precise
about the questions and parameters that
we want our code to be done in certain
form but still it is just able to pass
68 test cases out of 111 which is almost
50 to 60% of uh total amount of test
cases
so let's move on to the next
question that is find substring with
given hash value so let me quickly
search for this
question find
substring with
value again it's it's a question from
heart category and the success rate is
22.2% so let's have a look at the
question what it demands so here the
hash of a zero indexed string of length
K given integers P and M is computed
using the following functions now hash
with parameters
SPM uh this is the logic given how we
want our output to be demonstrated in
certain value or how the hash can be
generated the particular formula uh how
you can get the hash value of your you
know uh
string so the question is you are given
a string and the
integers uh and you have to return the
first substring of that string of length
uh given to you here it's K the test
cases will be generated such that and
answer always exists we are going to
copy this course and mention all the
specifications mentioned here in their
chat GPD console so that it gets all the
specifications the code and
so I have copied the code and paste it
over here now let's check for
indentation that's fine let's remove
class my
class
and again it face this is a type error
so let's move on to the next question
again we saw that CH was not able to
solve this particular question coming
back to our list the next question in
the list that we are going to cover is
partition array into two arrays to
minimize some difference let's quickly
search for that
question partition array
to two
arrays again this question is from heart
category and the success rate is even
more low so let's have a look at the
question first it's partition array into
two arrays to minimize some difference
that is generated as the
output we can see that there are three
constraints so now quickly copy this
question and see if it is able to solve
this question or not first we have to
create a new
chat
copy all the constraints
let's see what chity has to say for this
particular
question let's ask it to generate a code
this time it has only generated the
logic not exactly Logic the approach
that they are going to follow or anyone
can follow to solve this
question me ask if it can generate a
code it's definitely taking longer time
to generate this code okay here is the
code which is possible python
implementation and
uh okay the code is generated and uh
it's mentioning that the code takes in
an input an array of an integer called
nums so basically uh it's explaining
that what it actually it's doing which
is pretty much explained in the question
itself that what exactly it needs to
function like and what will be the
variables and what will be the inputs
and how it needs to be segregated to uh
obtain our Optimum
result
so let's copy
this
and paste it over here again like I said
we can see that it's generating you know
uh again we could see
that pass self
parameter
okay and
then attribute errors
let's quickly copy
it paste it over
here see what CH GPD has to say about it
okay that you have seen that after
placing the error it's giving that error
message you're seeing suggest that
there's a problem with the function name
in your code so the error message is
indicating that there is no function
called minimum difference within the
solution uh Al also I have seen that
apart from the function name it doesn't
have a self parameter so let me just
write it
down
self
argument
in apps wait let me copy it that will be
better
and write
a new code with
it let me see if it can generate a new
code this
time so yeah it has a GRE sure there is
an example and here's the code so I have
copied
this
and pasted
over see any such huge difference in the
sentex or the logic of the code but yeah
we can definitely think of running now
let's run this
code me copy it and paste it over here
again an error has prompted out I don't
know how uh
valid code we'll get after projecting
this error over here in chart
GPD so yeah definitely considering the
error message you seeing is indicated
that the function is returning INF which
is not a valid value for the expected
return type
integer so in the base case where I and
J are both zero the value of is set to
float which is positively Infinity
however the expected output is an
integer so this valid this value is not
valid so again considering this change
the Char GPD is giving a new code so let
us see how valid this new code
is okay I can see that it has changed
logic over here instead of float INF it
has change it has uh written a new
syntax and New Logic over there now and
also Char gu guarantees that this may
solve the issue of returning INF as the
value let's see how accurate chart GPT
here
is
now we have pasted
logic uh yeah
as oh sorry I need to remove these two
lines
now let's quickly run this
program okay so now as you can see it
could only pass one test case but not
the first two so there's no point of
submitting this code as we can see that
the logic for this code or this code as
a whole is
not well moving on next in the list we
have is
longest common sa now let's see
longest
common
saath so this question also comes from
category of hard questions and the
success rate is 27% now let's see what
this question demands actually now let's
quickly copy this question with all the
constraints and whatever apart from a
example is left on the screen we need to
copy it as you can see over here you
cannot just miss out on any
specifications talking about the
constraints
copy and paste now
enter giving the approach to solve this
question which is dynamic Pro
programming approach okay we didn't got
any code over here so let's
try that if it can present a
code I have asked to write a code for
this and uh yes Char has definitely
agreed to provide me a code for it uh
Char is done with it explan ations I'll
type it out and wait for the new code
which will contain self as a parameter
that it's this scode is pretty similar
to the previous one it's just that it's
using the self argument the function as
it was mentioned by me so let's quickly
copy this
code paste it over here check for the
indentation run this
code I don't should be
any okay I spoke too fast here we have
another error let's see what Char has to
say about
this the list index out of range change
error is likely occurring on line 10
because the indices I and J are being
properly bounc checked before being used
to access elements in the path and tpr
okay so we have found a new code let's
quickly copy this code and see if this
code is capable of you
know eliminating the errors we probably
found
cck copy and
paste let me check for the
ination done and
run then we got a error over here even
though after providing so many
specifications and criterias and errors
and conditions yet chat gbd is not able
to provide a perfect solution for the
code uh moving on to the last question
of our list that is going to be uh sum
of total strength of wizards hopefully
this question does some magic for chat
GPT and prove itself lucky for CH GPT
graph for this video because for now we
can see it's a 50/50 scene uh half of
the question Chad GB was able to provide
Solutions with and half of the questions
chat GPD couldn't actually figure out
what uh needs to be done even the logic
and approach was correct still the
implementation of the code was not
correct so let me search for
this question sum of
total strength of visits again a hard
category question so let's have a look
at the question
first let's C copy this
question uh create a new
chat paste it over
here and uh look for constraints now
that we have copied it pasted and
enter it's giving an approach how you
can actually uh think of a solution for
this but particular question charity has
not generated any code uh let me ask for
it
okay so here's an example again they
have implemented the code in Python now
it is also giving a note that the
approach is valid only if you're allowed
to modify the original array and also we
are not working on down over
menion and then write this quote so
let's see if it can do it with self
argument okay so yeah there's an example
it's generating the code okay so let's
see what's the update with the
code okay
thiser
R let's
add
solution and run the
code so there's a runtime error let me
see
why this
error and paste it over
here what Char have to say the error
message solution object has no attribute
mod so just that there is a class name
solution and the code is trying to
access an attribute named mod on an
instance of that class but the attribute
doesn't exist we probably uh need to
make more specifications and if it still
doesn't works then it clearly classifies
that Char doesn't takes every point or a
classification uh you know in
consideration uh which
ultimately uh you know reflects on the
solution the new code is here let me
quickly paste it
okay let's try running this code let's
see if this
works try running it
again again it has a runtime error I was
unable to solve one more question now
that we have tried and tested a huge
spectrum of questions from dead code on
chat GPT we can conclude that though
chat GPT is an amazing tool with the
bright future it still has its own
limitations and maybe it is not ready to
replace humans or compete with human
brains these questions were picked from
a list of frequently asked questions for
interviews and examinations chat GPT
does have a potential to generate Logics
and approaches for the code in an
effective manner but still its ability
to analyze the question is weak as
compared to humans as we know these
questions are there the success rate
just shows that a proper solution to
exist for these questions but still even
after multiple attempts chat GPD was not
able to find the correct answer but we
can also give chat GPD the benefit of
doubt that it's still it in in its
initial phase and still there are a lot
of aspects that need to be worked on so
probably in future CH GPT can take an
upper hand over this but for now chat
GPD needs to do a lot of work for these
situations we'll start with a chat GPT
to automate our Excel and we have some
Excel files I will upload them in the
link with the GitHub so you can freely
download them and you can also try this
project with those files and here we are
with the chat JP so now we are on the
chat JP website and here you can see
that there a try chat jpt option and
when we click it we will be redirecting
to the chat jpt the chat box and before
that I will show you the
homepage it's showing us the samples
what we can do with the chat jpt
the
methods and there's the collect
demonstration data and train a
supervised policy like how it's trained
how open a has trained the chat jbt and
its
limitations they have mentioned all the
things here itative
deployment and moving on now we will log
in to our chat
jpd I will log in with my Google
account tell us about you and this is my
name and he's
asking my phone
number so I will get this blurred so you
guys won't be seeing my phone number
okay is asking for the code I'm waiting
for the code after entering the OTP you
would be directed to this page that is
chat GPT and this is the feedbox where
you can write any query in the simple
natural language that would be English
and the chat jbt would answer your
question
and if we talk about CH jity uh little
bit information about JJ that it's an AI
power chatboard that has been developed
by open Ai and the chatboard understands
natural language and responds in a
humanlike manner it is based on GPT 3.5
which is a language model and the
chatboard was unveiled as a prototype on
November 30 2022 while announcing the
chatboard open a wrote on its
announcement page that we have trained a
model called chat jpt which interacts in
a conversational way the dialogue format
makes it possible for chat GPD to answer
followup questions admit its mistake
challenge incorrect premises and reject
inappropriate requests so now we will
talk about the chat gbt so chat gbt is
an AI powered chat board that has been
developed by the artificial intelligence
and it's been researched by the company
open Ai and the chatboard understands
natur language and responds in a
humanlike manner it is based on GPT 3.5
which is a language model the chatboard
was unveiled as a prototype on November
30 2022 while announcing the chatboard
openi wrote on its announcement page
that we have trained a model called Chad
jpd which interacts in a conversational
way the dialogue format makes it
possible for chat jity to answer
followup questions admit its mistake
challenge incorrect premises and reject
inappropriate
requests so this is
jity and it's been boing all the
developers around the globe so now we'll
start with automating Excel with the
help of chat jpt and with the help of
Python
language so
first we will create a folder and see
the Excel files with which we will use
Python and with the help of chat jpt
we will automate
them so first we'll create a folder for
our project and we'll create in Python
projects and name it
as automate Excel using Chad
jpt and inside this we will open the
command prompt
and now we'll open any ID so that we'll
write a request to chat GPT and he'll
answer us with the suitable code and
that code will'll copy paste into our
idle and run it if it gives any error we
will copy paste the error same to the
chat jpt and as I know he answers them
so here we will open our ideally and for
that we write getting a command that is
code space period and that will open our
ideally that is Visual Studio
code now we have open our ID and first
we'll create a file
here or first we will see our Excel
files on which we will do the
Automation and for that we'll get back
to our
folder and here we have the number
folder in which we have two files that
is CSV files phone number and phone
number
two and other we have the sales folder
and in that we have the date of the
sales of the Year
2022 so we will use these files sales
and the number so we'll cut them
and get to a
folder and inside the number file no uh
we'll start with
sales first we'll do the automation with
the sales
files so we'll open the sales folder and
inside that we will create a file that
would be the py file
and the first automation we would be
doing is concatenating all the files in
a single Excel file we have the files
from January to December that is the
sales files so we will concatenate them
and ask the chat J to write the code to
con sorry to concatenate all
these so for
that we name the file as conate only
Nate _ data
py so now we'll give the command to the
chat
GPT so here is a chat jpd and here we
will write a command for it that would
be I have 12 Excel
files and I want to concatenate
them and we'll also mention the name
named
January spending January is this only
but we'll check with the file
January and then we have
February and moving
on SE we have till December
so we have all these 12 files and now
we'll command him to use
Python to concatenate the data inside
the 12 XEL files into one file
so this is our Command and it's in the
simplest natural language that is the
English language so we'll just press
enter okay it shows us that an error
occurred if there show this so for this
thing we'll just copy the open a link
and paste it here and open it as the
chat jpt is seeing a huge
traffic sometimes it shows
these
errors so he's verifying us whether we
are a robot or not so we will agree with
the chat
jity and answer its questions
here it's asking again okay okay now we
are clear with the chat jity and we'll
paste our Command here and press
enter and here you can see that it has
started answering our question that you
can use the pandas library in Python to
read in the data from each of the Excel
files and use the concat function to
combine the data from all the Val into
one data frame here an example of how
you use
okay is going in a very right
Manner and he has imported pandas and
then create a data and
using the for
Loop is going through all the months
reading the Excel file and appending
okay
done and result he has concatenated but
he has not created the Excel file where
we can see all the data and he has also
not printed it so what we want so first
we'll see
what does this code do as I have seen so
it will concatenate but it has not
created the Excel file in which we can
see all the data so we have copied the
code we will paste it
here save it and run
it and most important thing you have to
import the pandas library and if you
have not installed it please install it
in the command prompt with the command
pip install inst pandas or you can use
it in the
terminal
okay it has not found the January do
XLS okay J and UA are
by SP we'll
see what error it expects
we'll save this and run once
again so we'll just copy the error and
write it back to chat GPT and
see how does it
respond okay it's seeing is indicating
that the p libr is unable to find the
Excel file you trying to read in based
on the error message look like the files
are not located in the same directory as
the python
script okay we'll see that but we have
the python script and the
library in the
same
folder
yeah concatenate
DOI and we'll check once
again
here data
P they are in the same folder and why we
have this
error okay
so so the is we have opened our
IDE
and automated Excel using chat jpd
folder and currently we are in sales
folder so it is not
recognizing the
directory so what we'll
do we'll copy all these
files copy the sales
files and paste it
here
now now we will run the port that C
provided
us okay uh yeah it has done
successfully ex successfully okay we'll
try once again we kill the
terminal save it and run it
again now we'll see yeah it has executed
successfully uh but the thing is it has
not converted it
into a single SLE Excel file for that
we'll
write you forgot
to
create the
concatenated file as we also haven't
mentioned in our
Command
specifically so we have to be specific
with our commands also
let's
see yeah after conting the data frame to
export to a Excel file we can just write
this
command and index equal to false here
okay and he is giving all the
explanations so you can just read them
you correct I apologize for the site to
create a new Excel file that contains
data you can use the toore XEL method of
the data frame here is an example of how
you could do this okay cre a new Excel
file named concore data. xcl SX the same
directory as your python script and it
will contain the concatenated data form
from all of the original Excel file you
could also use the 2or CSV method to
save the data frame in CSV format here
we can do that
also okay well
make the xlsx
file and just beneath
it
yeah see part
two
okay uh we don't need any path we'll
just do it here only
yeah result.
2XL data.
xss so we'll save this and run
it it is showing that it has executed
successfully and yeah outside the sales
folder will close that you can see that
it has created the concatenated data.
xlsx so for that we move here yeah it
has created it
here we'll open
it and first I will show you what these
files
contain so every file have the entry of
around th000 every file has
th000 entries
so the conate file should have around
12,000 so this is the concore data and
if we go
beneath yeah we can
see
2000 and it's yeah it say it has
concatenated all the data so yeah chat
GPT responded and we have to precise
with the commands what we are writing in
English as it has not mentioned to
convert it into Excel file now when we
have WR it again it has done that now
moving on we will do the second
Automation and for that we'll move back
to our ideally and the next next
automation we would be doing would be
that we will be using the sum and the
average function to all the files that
is from January to December files and
we'll use sum and average function I'll
will show you where we will
use so it's
data so we'll open the August
file and here
you can see the quantity in the Hedge
column so we'll aage down the quantity
so what is the average per
customer
and in the J column we have the total
cost so we'll add all the cost in all
the files this is the August file from
January to December we will do in column
match the average for the quantities and
column J we'll do the sum of the total
amount per customer and we'll get it
printed at the last column that would be
we have the,
entries it's going
till
h11 so we would get it printed on
h12 and the sum we would get it printed
on
j102 okay so moving on we'll close these
files we will get back to a chat jpd and
give him a command that I have 12 Excel
files and we'll tell him that we have
named
them
January then we
have February
then we have till
December and
now we want you to use
Python
to
apply the sum
formula the sum formula and the average
formula so the sum formula would be
applied from J2 to
j101 see okay we have close file yeah
what I remember some formula
from J2 to
J10 one okay and the average
function and now we want him to use the
average
formula from H2 to H1 0
1 okay and that would be in all the
Excel
files and we want him to write the
results in the cells and that would be
J12 and
h12
respectively so we have to be precise
with the commands and we have an error
here uh that is done and yeah it's all
done I'll just give this command to chat
JP and see how it answers use the pan as
l in Python to read okay and perform the
sum and average calculations good and
then write the results back to the same
file here is an example of how you could
do this you have we are writing in the
same
file okay we are importing PD and
running a loop for all the months we
have read all the Excel files one by one
and we are taking the
cell one and I location and doing the
sum and doing the mean of the edge
column yeah it's
good
Excel yeah I think it would do a
job so we'll copy this and create a new
file and name it
as sum.
py and inside this we will paste the
code that our GPT has provided
us and we'll run this and it has
executed successfully okay no uh we got
an error that
is okay it has made the
mistake okay
it okay we'll just see what
query we WR I have 12 X Files named
January to December and use Python to
apply the Su formula from J2 to
j11 and the average formula from H2 to
h101 in all the files and write the
results
a
done uh we would be a little specific
Sals
J12 and
okay okay okay okay
yeah once again subit it if we didn't
get okay yeah now he has used the
open yxl Library that's
good yeah that would be working for
us let's
see what he will provide to
us
here
she
and
okay
okay yeah think
uh it can serve the purpose but first
we'll run it so he is giving us the
explanation for what he has written this
code that is this code will apply the
sum formula to the range j22 j11 and the
average formula to the range H2 to h11
in all the Excel files the results will
be written in
J12 and h12 respectively it is important
to note that this code will overwrite
the original file so that it's
recommended to make a backup okay we
don't need that
and we have backup in the sales folder
also so you can also the read uncore XEL
and 2core XEL function from
P
okay so we'll try this
code uh it is not return to import OS
and guys uh you have to install all
these libraries open pyxl I have already
installed them you can search on the
browser that open pyxl installation
Python and it would be directed to pypi
tocom that's the official website for
the particular libraries and there you
can see the command that would be the
PIP install and the particular command
for the module
name uh it is showing that it has run
successfully so we'll just see if it has
done its job or not
and in the April file we have in the H
column that is the average of the H
column that was the items and in the J
column we have the total sum of the
amount of the customers yeah the query
has run successfully Chad jpt has
provided us with the perfect code heads
off to the Jet gbt and moving on now
we'll do some other Auto
ations and
now what we can
do uh we have other files that is phone
number and phone number
two and what it
contains it contains the phone
numbers so what we could do is we could
add the plus 91 extension that is is the
country code for India we will ask chat
jpt to add the country code plus 91 to
both the
files so I'll close these
files and
first we'll copy them and paste in
our root directory so we don't get any
error and
we'll change the
slide
name instead of high
we will add
underscore
okay now we'll move back to chat jpd and
write a
command and these files are CSV files
not xlsx
file yeah these are CSU files both the
files are CSU files other files are xlsx
files okay so for that we'll write the
command to chat JT
that I have two
files
uh with to CSV
extension and they are named
phone
underscore number and the second was
named phone underscore number uncore
2 okay so we have told the J jpt that we
have two files and now we will tell him
to use
Python to add the country
code add
the
country code plus
91 as string
prefix and that would be adding as a
string prefix else it would only show 91
it won't show plus so we'll see if Chad
jpd understand that or not as string
prefix in both the CSV files
with column name that was
phone okay now we'll just press
enter and wait for a CH jity to answer
this
query and we'll see how it
responds you can use the Pand library to
okay and theix to the phone numbers and
modify data
okay do this
[Music]
okay friend now we are
reading and phone right
it's adding S Type string okay it has
understood that and to
CSV and this code will in both F yeah I
think this will
work we have copied the code this code
will in both CS files and the plus time
string to the phone numbers and write
the modifi data back to CS files it's
important to know that this will
override the original files so it's
recomed to make a backup of the original
okay
uh you could also use the apply function
to add the prefix to the phone number in
the column
okay okay yeah uh we can do this also
with the Lambda
function and that's this will also do a
job first we'll see
this and we will create a file
put this Automation and name it as
country code. py okay and we'll paste
the code
here and run it for you guys it's
showing that it has executed
successfully uh yeah it has executed
successfully so we'll
just go back to our
files and
see whether they go Plus 91 as a prefix
or not here the numbers okay the files
scod only 91 as the column it's still in
the number
format it
hasn't converted into string format uh
we'll see the second code
also
like yeah it has converted X string okay
Lambda X we'll see
it's working or
not like it has worked uh and the issue
is we
have change the files permission denied
okay we have opened a file we'll close
it on
save save this and run it
again now it CH it has executed
successfully we'll open the file
and now if we
see it is showing yeah now it has added
2
91s uh so no isues uh the thing is first
we have to transform it into the string
format and then we can add plus 91 as a
string to that
string so chat J misses with the
slightest implementation the
code now moving on uh we'll see this
command later if you want to see how we
can add plus 91 I will tell you how to
write that code
okay so now moving on we will do another
Automation and you would be glad to know
that Chad jpt improves the existing code
like uh in the first automation it has
concatenated but it hasn't converted the
concatenated file like it hasn't created
that file it had created the file when
we have returned to it that you forgot
to create that file so chat jpd it
modulates the existing code
also and moving
on
now uh in any
okay we'll open the concatenated _ data
xlsx and inside this okay we have the
product line so what we'll do is we will
change
the name of the electronic assessors to
electronic equipments and home and
lifestyle to
Lifestyle now we'll automate this
process
and we can do this automation all the
files also from January to
December so we'll do that only
okay now
here we will command
is Okay now we'll command the chat jpt
that using
python I
trate
through all the Excel
files in
the directory so we are asking him to
iterate through all the Excel files in
the directory and we will ask him to
replace what was electronic asss
electronic
accessories see the
spelling accessories
okay yeah electronic accesses with
electronic equipments
and we'll also ask
him
equipments okay we'll do equipment only
and home and lifestyle we choos
yeah
and home and life
style
and change it with
only
lifestyle okay so using python we are
iterating through all the Excel files
and changing
these uh that would be in each Excel
file so we have to be specific with a
written language and now we'll save the
modified workbook in
we'll create another folder and in that
we will save the
files
okay save
the
modified
file in
the
output
folder and if the folder is not created
we'll ask him to create
it
okay then create
one
hold and
it okay uh I don't know why I'm saving
this so I have written the command I
will press enter so that J jpd can
process it and give us the code for
that so it's showing us sorry that was
showing us uh you can use the OS Library
toate through all the Excel files and
the Pand Li to read in the files and
make the changes and to save the
modified files okay here's an example
example of how you could do
this now here we imported OS Pand PD and
it has written the code we'll copy that
this code will iterate through all the
Excel files in the current directory
replace electronic accessories with
electronic equipment and home and
lifestyle with lifestyle in the data
frame and then save the modified files
in the output folder if the sorry in the
output folder doesn't exist the script
will create it
you would also use replace function to
replace values in the colum
okay this will it through all the cells
in each row of the Excel sheet and
replace electronic accessories with
electronic equipment and home and
lifestyle with lifestyle if the cell
value is equal to the respective string
okay we have copied a code and now we
will create a
file and
name it as it trade.
py paste the code here and run it for
you
guys the code has been executed
successfully now we'll
see we open all the files not all but
yeah we'll open
some that was the previous electronic
accessories okay so it hasn't changed in
this okay we will open another
file and see if we code the changes in
that or
not that also States the electronic
accessories so it
hasn't done its
job so we move back to GPD
and use this code if it functions
else we'll write back to the chat
jpd
Jo
okay just a
second we are using the
replace and
okay so for here we have to import the
OS
done
loore
book and for
that about
this it
close this
files
okay now we'll
see if we go our solution or
not no it's showing electronic
accessories and home and lifestyle so
chat jpd
doesn't go the code to change
them so we'll ask him another time and
with a different language this
time what I don't I think it has created
the output
folder it has oh
sorry I'm really sorry what I have done
is my
mistake those were the original
files and we have the product line here
and we have electronic accessories
here and that should be equipment
Ms okay uh we have electronic
accessories and
lifestyle let me see my
command okay I have asked him to change
electronices with electronic equipment
and home lifestyle with lifestyle so it
has changed only lifestyle
let
see
okay
okay uh the E here is small we'll update
that in the code
you can write this back to chat jpt also
but yeah first do
this what are i
showing not has executed successfully
okay in the output folder we have the
this
number
accessories that's the capital okay okay
okay okay so this code is giving us
error we'll see the last code we copy
that
and try to use this
close the terminal and run it
again it has executed successfully now
we'll see the
file whether it has changes or not it
has not now we'll ask the chat jpd
what have you done
brother using python I through all the
Excel files in the Dory and replace
electronic accessories with electronic
equipment and home and lifestyle with
lifestyle okay each Excel file save the
modified
[Music]
file okay we ask the same thing once
again to him
and with this electronic accessories oh
sorry and save the modified
file output folder and get the folder it
doesn't exist okay
okay
same
the see once
again close these files
has executed successfully now we'll open
it and now we can see that it has
changed to electronic
equipment electronic
equipment yeah now it has executed
successfully maybe there would be an
error with us while copying it as we
have also created the output folder but
we forgot to see in that folder maybe
that would be the error from our
side now we are done with the changing
of the column names uh it's the cell
names that was electronic accessories to
electronic equipments and home and
lifestyle to Lifestyle now we'll do the
next
automation for that first we'll open any
Exel
file uh this was in the output
folder and get pack to our main
directory and open the file
July and
here here we will filter the Excel file
for gender that is we'll select gender
as female and with the unique values in
column
City and we'll extract the data from
column A to q that would be the whole
data
and for each Unique city value we'll
create a new Excel file for each City
and that will contain data only for that
City and for females only and after that
we'll save this file in a folder named
City so we'll give this command to chat
jpd and here you can also specify the
module you want chat JP to use for the
particular command here we will be
commanding the Chad jbt to use the
pandas module and for that we'll write
the command not command in the natural
language we'll give this command to the
chat
jbt and for that we'll write using
Python and
pandas filter
the okay we will just pick a single
Excel file or we can pick the
concatenated file that is concatenated _
data filter
the
concatenated underscore
data dot Excel
SX Excel
file and that would be for gender
female and and by
the unique values in column
City okay first we'll give the
command by the unique
values in the
column
City and after after that we want to
extract the data from column A to q that
is the whole
sheet extract the
data from the
column A to q and for each Unique city
value
for each
Unique
city
value now we will extract the data and
now we'll create a new Excel file so for
that also we'll give the command to J
jpd and we'll write create a new Excel
file and that would be for each
City
Okay so so we'll write create a
new Excel
file for each
City
containing
data only
for
that
City and for
females
okay and Save this file in
the city
folder and if it's not been there chat
jpt can create the folder for that
also okay City folder
and naming the each file with the city
name okay
naming each
file after
the
corresonding
city
okay now if
the city folder that is we have WR the
small City okay
if the city folder doesn't
exist then create
it before saving the
files
okay now we have given this command to
the chat GPT and it has responded us
with you can use the pandas Library as
we have already mentioned to use that to
readin the
concore data. xlsx file and filter the
data for gender femil group the data by
the unique values in the city column and
extract the data from the specified
columns for each group and here is an
example so we have put the
code we'll wait till chat jpd continues
and we can see that the chat GPD has
completed
and we will copy this code
C
see
F City make the Dory for City and for
City Group in female data Group by okay
City and you could also use the Asen
method to filter the data frame for
female gender okay first we'll see
this and for that we will create filter.
py and run the
code it has been executed successfully
so now you'll see that the city folder
has been created or
not I'm not able to see the city
folder okay it's been created
so we see okay it's been
created man it's still
empty so we'll give
time okay we qu an
error okay okay we'll pass this error to
J J first and after that we'll see
what's wrong with
this and you are so the message you're
saying is inting that the column name
specified in the list are not present in
the data frame it's likely that the
actual column names in the data frame
are different than the ones you
specified in the
list okay just see the list
that is concatenated
data go
back and see that is
A2 okay it's still
R okay made a little mistake here
so we'll
just change our
Command yeah this is it and instead of Q
now we'll write R and save and submit
now we'll see what it
would what it would generate for
us we'll close this
okay this will F in Exel files filter
the data for fems group The by the
unique values in the city column create
and extract the data from the column A
to R for each Unique city name and then
create a new Excel file for each City
containing data only for that City and
for females files will be sa in the city
folder naming each file after the
corresponding City
okay it's done now we'll copy this
code and paste it here and
see whether this code works for us or
not
so it's being executed successfully now
we have moved to the okay it's executing
so we'll give time to the
code let it do it so yeah it's been
executed
successfully okay so there were three
cities that was
manday Na and Yangon
and if I show you the
data you could
see there see three cities and it has
created the Excel files with the name of
the Cities only the unique cities and it
has extracted the data for the gender
female now we'll see those
files close this
and
back and the city
folder could see the manday city and the
data is just for the
females so this automation works well
with J
jpt now moving on we will do one more
Automation and that would be to use
python to identify what is the count of
each payment
mode so for
that I will just get you aware of the
payment modes in our sheet and we'll do
this automation on the concatenated data
sheet
only so this is the payment column and
you can see the mode of payments that is
ewallet cash credit card and these are
repeating so we will use Python to
identify what is the count of each
payment mode from column M column n
sorry and that is from this sheet only
and then we'll create a new sheet and
name it as count. xlsx and write the
count against each payment method so
we'll give this command to our chat
gbt and ask him to write the code for
our
automation so we writing use python to
identify use Python to
identify what is the count
of
each payment
method
[Music]
from column and the column was n from
column n and that was in
concatenated
concore data do xlsx
sheet
and create a new
sheet
named count do
xlsx and
write the
count
against each payment
method
okay now we have given this command to a
chat jpd and we'll see what it offers to
us you can use the Pand libr to read
okay that's the same value counts
function to get the count of each V
method okay and you can use the 2 XEL
method to the data frame to write the
count to a new sheet okay that's good
and he has imported the Panda's library
and create the DF variable in which he
has read the concatenated file and used
counts function with payment
method and col to P okay the column name
is
payment note payment method I think it
would
generate an error for
us
[Music]
so spon of each one method from column
n and we will
specify column m n that is
named payment as it has used payment
method here you can
see that it has used a column name as
payment method so will specify
this we have to be very specific with
our commands for these automations for
simple task you can use Simple language
like no complex sentences or you have to
mention every detail but for these
automations you have to use
them now our chat GPD is working with
this and mostly it will deliver us with
the perfect code I hope so
okay
uh has R and the value and it has
exported
reset also the group by function to
group the data the P method and use the
size method
okay okay we'll see
this and
here we will create a file as count.
py and in this file we'll paste the code
delivered us by the chat
jpt we
have executed it it's being executed
we'll wait for that
it's meain ex
successfully so we have mve back to our
folder and we have to look
for file count file yeah count
file okay is this the no it's the okay
yeah it's showing us the
mode of payments that is ewallet cash
credit card and the number of
usage yeah 4 4
8,3 12 yeah it's 12,000 that was the
whole entry of the
concore data. xlsx so we have done with
this Automation and now we'll do one
last
Automation and first
we'll close all these
files okay and moving back to our J GPT
and now we will do we will rename all
the 12 Excel files that was January
February to December and we'll add the
word or car sales just before the month
name that would we will just add the
prefix before the month name and for
that we'll give the command to the chat
jpt in the natural language and here
only we will change it in the main
directory only as we have the copy of
all these files so for this we write the
commant use
Python rename
all the 12 Excel
files
named
January
February
until
December
okay and that is present in my directory
and what we have to do is we have
to add uh the word will add Car Sales
okay car cells
in front
of
each in front
of each file
name okay
so what it will do is Car Sales
underscore January car sales _ febrary
and so on so we'll wait for the chat jpd
you can use the OS library to iterate
through all the Exel files Ona then use
the W to rename function okay to rename
the files here is an example of how you
could do this go to S and we have the
months
okay this code will iterate through all
the Excel files in the CR directory and
add car cells in front of each file
name and those files would be those only
the months and good it's using the glow
module and you could also use the glow
module okay that's the second
code it's the easy one
okay but we'll go with OS
first and get back to our ideally and
and name the file as rename
dopy and here we'll paste the
code and run
it it's been executed we'll move back
yeah you could see that car sales have
been added to all the
files and with that we have done with
our
automations and if you want you can also
submit your code to Chad GPT and ask it
to add commands to your code so that it
could explain you what that line does or
what that function does it would explain
very tediously and if you want you can
also try CH gbd to automate many office
tasks you can automate PowerPoint for
that and do many more tasks with J JP
did you know that 93% of online
experiences begin with a search engine
that's a massive audience you are
missing out on if your website isn't

according to you then we will understand
SEO prompt for statistics and FAQs after
that we will understand plagarism check
meta title and descriptions and in the
end chat GPT for summary all right so
now before using the chat gpt's
abilities to enhance SEO in your
system we need to install an extension
that extension is known as
aipm so the aipm extension is a powerful

aipm extension
click on enter so this is the first link
basically we'll click on
it and this is aipm for chat gbt don't
get confused with any other extension
this is this looks like this and now
we'll click on add to
Chrome and then add
extension and that's
it now let's just click on
allow and it is integrated I
believe
yes so as you can see it is also showing
a quick start tutorial select a prom
template enter the WordPress or more
send
message so we'll click on get if you
want to view tutorials you can click on
this otherwise you can get started with
AI VM so as you can see the whole layout
the whole interface is changed there are
lot of things over here let me explain
to you guys what all these things are
all right so there are various Options
under public and own from which you can
filter prompts by uh topic as you can
see or
activity and then uh prompts can be
sorted by top videos trending as you can
see and uh there are actually 4892
prompts available and uh you can see the
first 12 on this page as you can
see and some examples of prompts here is
like you can say us SE optimized content
writer human written 100% unique SE
optimized article so these are the
examples of prompt now first of all
we'll ask Chad gbt to write a blog post
for us on let's say Fitness all right so
we'll ask J
gbt Fitness in
everyday lifestyle
all right uh let's click on
this so we haven't used any prompt till
yet so let's just first put this input
and let's see what CH GPT gives
us all
right so as you can see this is the
topic name importance of everyday
Fitness simple strategies to incorporate
Fitness then we can see subtopics are
also there
right and here's the conclusion all
right so this is basically our blog post
so now let's say we want to optimize
this blog post and we want to do SEO on
this one so let's first just copy this
we'll copy this and paste in
our
document all right so this is our
document and we have pasted this all
right now let's go back over here and
let's say we want to write it in a more
familiar or you can say friendly tone
and in a more explanatory tone you can
also use so let's just write
this don't worry about the spelling guys
uh CH take care of this all right so
let's see what are the changes in both
of these block
post let's just wait to finish
it and here's the conclusion so this is
the second blog post so let's understand
the difference uh in between these two
first we'll first check out for this one
start small begin with manageable
changes all
right as you can see here it is begin
with manageable changes take the stairs
instead of elevat a walk or bike to
nearby destinations or stand and stretch
during work breaks these small efforts
can add up over time all right let's
just see what is written over here in
the second block Post in the second
block post it is written begin with
manageable changes that fit seamlessly
into your daily routine for example or
for instance choose to take the stairs
instead of elevator walk or bike to
nearby destination instead of driving or
stand and stretch during work breaks
these small efforts can accumulate over
time and contribute to your overal
Fitness so if you want to take the
second one which is a few changes it is
more bit
explanatory uh compared to the first one
we can just copy paste this this one as
well so you can uh write a second prompt
as well in which if you want to write in
a friendly tone or in a formal tone you
can write like that all you have to do
is to just write the prompt in chat gbt
let's just copy paste it and replace it
with the First with the second
one all right so now we are back in chat
gbt so now basically we have the blog
post content basically we have the
content of it now we want to polish it
we want to select the best title out of
it and many more things so for that
let's just make use of prompts instead
of writing all these prompts by yourself
you can make use of the prompts that is
that comes with aipm ch gbt prompts all
right so let's just say we want to write
about the title we want to select a
perfect title for this blog post so what
we can do is we'll go over here and
first of all we'll select in topics
we'll go and we'll select copywriting
because we want to write about the S
optimize title we want the best title
we'll select
copywriting
confirm all right now after this you can
just go
for prompts what whichever you
like I'm going to go for this one blog
post title generator as you can see also
if you didn't get what you wanted then
you can go for the search engine over
here you can just type let just say if
you want to uh want to if you're writing
a script basically and you want a
perfect title for it then you can write
a script generator or something like
that over here automatically whichever
prompt that are relevant to it will come
all right so we have selected this one
blog post title generator because we
have to create a title for our blog post
we'll click on this and now all we have
to do is to write the name of our blog
post the name of our blog post is we'll
select everyday Lifestyle Fitness in
everyday lifestyle let's just select
this
one all right now as you can see you can
select the titles to write it is five
let's just select 10 all right now the
language you can select English and many
more languages are there we'll keep it
in English itself tone emotional or
default let's just be default itself
poetic default default itself we'll keep
it like this all right
now click on this let's just
see so according to chat gpta and prompt
these are the 10 best title that you we
can Implement in our blog post now what
we want to do is select one best title
out of it all right so these are 10 we
have to select one out of it so for that
we'll go to Google Keyword
Planner so this is Google Keyword
Planner we'll click on this find your
campaign and keywords we'll click on
this visit Keyword Planner now you guys
might be thinking what is Google Keyword
Planner so let me explain to you
guys so this Google Keyword Planner is a
free tool that helps you find keywords
for your online content it shows you how
often people search for certain words
and phrases and how much competition
there is to rank for those keywords this
way you can choose the best keywords to
Target in your ads or blog post or
website to attract more visitors and
potential customers so it'll give you
the numbers basically which are mostly
ranking and having the competition all
right so we'll click on discover new
keywords and let's select where it is
we'll select the first
10 go to Google Keyword Planner and now
here we will paste
it so all 10 of them are pasted now what
we'll do is we'll click on get results
so after clicking on get results as you
can
see so this is average monthly searches
this is competition the we want the
maximum monthly searches Fitness healthy
lifestyle and low in competition so
according to your preference you can
select from here and whichsoever this is
100k to 1 million and many more more
topics you can select from here which
has low competition so as you can see
this treadmill has more uh average view
100K to 1 million but the competition is
also high so we should keep the
competition low as well so we should
keep in mind so we can select our best
title from it so whichever
suits all right after selecting the best
title we can go
to our what we call this blog post to
change the title so this is the new
title let's keep it like
this all right so now our title is done
now let's go back to chat GPT
and here is a chat
gbt and now let's go to
the it's layout now here we want to
write the content regarding that
regarding that title so what we'll do is
basically we'll go over here and we'll
select
SEO and once we have selected it we'll
go we'll select this prompt human
written 100% used SE optimized article
now based on that title that we have
generated will'll write a complete
content on it we'll use the help of this
prompt so as you can see G gbt 3.5 turbo
gbt 4 gbt 40 we'll select
this and paste our title this is our
title transform your life how everyday
Fitness can boost your health so now
this PR will generate the content based
on this title all right now let's see
as you can see transform your life how
everyday Fitness can boost your health
this is the content
outline the article outline you can
say so this is the introduction what is
everyday
Fitness then physical fitness
benefits and it keeps on
writing I believe it will it will be a
long article or blog
so you don't have to write too many
prompts for this you can just do this
and the whole thing will take care of it
all as you can see Fu are also being
generated by this prompt otherwise we
would have wrote another prompt for the
FAQ and many things are there that
should be in there in the article all
blog so yeah now we can select our
article or blog we can
say so we have the title we don't want
the outline let's
say we'll take it from here from the
introduction it's a long article I
believe as you can see this last
question is not completed but you can
click on continue generating and it'll
complete that we don't want the last
question I think three questions or four
questions are sufficient for us so now
as we have copied it first of all we
need to make sure that our content is
unique it is not plagerized because we
can't publish or use the plagarized
content so we have to be sure that we
are using the unique content for that
we'll have to go to this site known
as duply
Checker we click click on this first
link and now as you can see here we can
copy and paste it paste we can just
exclude this last question as I told
you all right now our content our
article is pasted now we will check the
plagarism
all right first of all we'll have to
tell them that we are not a robot and
then we have to click on check
PLM all right so it is showing maximum
thousand words allowed per search all
right so let's just do one
thing we'll do it because if you want to
do thousand words you'll have to go for
their pro version or the premium version
so we now have
to use some part of it not the complete
part it's actually a long article so
from the rule we'll take
as you can see number of words is 5
not5 and result found zero 0% plagarism
12% uni all right so plagarism is uh 3%
I think that can be that can we can
neglect it and now let's check for the
rest of this
one
right all right here we'll copy and
paste
it check lism
as you can see number of words 671 0%
plagarism 12% unique so I don't think
it'll be a problem so it is good to go I
believe and now we just copy and paste
it so let's
take it from
here till
here all right so this is our content
now so our content was not plagarized
but let's just say if it is plagerized
and is not unique so what should we do
then we can simply put a prompt in chat
gbt that make it non plagarized or make
it unique or rephrase it but let's say
uh that plagerized Checker the duply
Checker mentions the particular lines or
where there is plagarism so you can
select that line put into chat gbd and
ask them to refres or make it plagarism
free by doing this you can make the
complete content plagarism free it is
very easy or else you can use a prompt
from aipm as I told you all you have to
do is to just type lism free content
writer and a particular prompt will come
you can just put your content in that
prompt and the rest Chad GD will take
care of all right now to boost your SE
strategy you must focus on E8 that is
expertise authora liveness and
trustworthiness and keep that human
element strong strong use chat gbt to
improve your content with interesting
verified facts and relevant examples
create a FAQ section to answer common
questions and look for any missing
information to fill in these steps will
help you make high quality content that
connects with your audience and ranks
better in search engines so for that
we'll write a prompt to uh chat gbt to
include the what we call FAQs and the uh
statistics we want to uh make use of
statistics and fq and include it in our
content so how should we do that let's
just understand it let's come to our
chat GPT again now here what we'll do is
we'll write a simple prompt
saying no no no first we go to the new
topic now here because otherwise it will
keep on writing in that prompt itself
all right we'll write
please add to what we call
stats or you can write
statistics and one
analogy and a
fq
section with
answers to
this
content draft to
increase
engagement all right now you want to uh
if you want to paste a particular
section of your content you can also do
that or else you can paste the entire
content it's as for your choice so let
me just paste a particular
section let's just paste this one and
all right let's
see all right so as you can see
statistics studies show that engaging in
just 30 minutes of modate physical
activity each day can reduce the risk of
chronic disease like heart disease so
these are the statistics and these are
the analogies and this is the FAQ
section that you can include in your
content or a particular section of the
content usually these statistics are
included in the introduction part to
make it more interesting so you can make
use of it and do that all right moving
forward let's understand the chat GT
prompts for meta titles and descriptions
so crafting meta titles and descriptions
is essential for drawing readers
attention so it is necessary that we
should use that all right so uh now
we'll be writing a particular prompt for
it for for
that for the content part I'll be
leaving the
space content here
and
create a meta
description and title for this content
here this mean this one all
right including
the keyword now here we'll mention the
keyword all right so whatever is the
focus keyword or the primary keyword you
want to include it in all right and
make it
easy to read and add
a CTA
so uh let's
just paste our content over here so
where is our content this is our content
and let's just use this one again you
can you have to use the entire content
but I'm just showing showing you so you
can use this one itself it'll be more
than enough don't have to worry about it
and the focus keyword
is
ly
lifestyle all right so this is it now
all we have to do is
to wait I've done something
wrong here we'll paste the healthy
lifestyle
and as we can see title transform your
Healthy transform your health with
everyday Fitness this is metad
description discover how incorporating
everyday Fitness into your routine can
transform your health this is metad
description this is CTA ready to
transform your life start incorporating

make use of it we'll
write

mentioned the hashtags # lify # everyday
Fitness # Wellness you can easily post
this on Twitter and write traffic from
there and you can also post this on
other social media handles as well okay
guys let's start with creating the
Google Slides or PowerPoint presentation
with the help of chj and we'll do this
in two ways starting one with the VBA
code so here we'll ask the chat gbt to
write a VBA code for the PowerPoint
presentation and for that we'll write a
prompt that is uh write a VBA code for
PowerPoint presentation and you would
just write the topic that is on how to
become a generative a expert and you
would mention some of the details like
you want a road map in the PowerPoint
presentation or just the steps to become
a gen a expert so let's see an
example so you ask the chat that
wrer VBA
code
for PowerPoint
presentation and we'll write the
topic on how to become a generative
AI or a master in generative AI
and here you could mention the details
also or you could ask the chat GPT that
you can act as an expert in computer
science or as an expert in artificial
intelligence and you could create a
PowerPoint presentation and give us a
VBA code on how to become a master in
generative and you could ask him that I
own the slides in a manner or you could
just list the slides that on slide one I
want the problem faced by gen experts
then in the next slide I want what
skills and on the next slide that is
slide two I want to know what skills
that generative AI expert should process
and in slide three I want the road map
and in the upcoming slides I want all
the road map skills or the roles to be
explained in a good manner that I can
understand or I can use this PP for like
for students to get them understand so
you could like
modify your prompt
accordingly so let's see uh how the chat
GPT respond to this and what VBA code it
will provide to
us so you could see that uh CHT has
started jointing the response and you
could see here that to use this VBA code
you'll need to access the vbi dator in
PowerPoint and for that you just need to
press alt plus f11 and then insert a new
module I'll show you how you could
insert the VB code in
PowerPoint uh till then he in
like generating the response we'll come
back here so this is the developer
option that we need to
unlock so just click on the blank
presentation and coming on the blank
presentation just right click here and
you could see the option customize the
ribbon so this is the ribbon the whole
thing this whole thing this is the
ribbon and you
could see the options
here and this is the developer option
which I have already tick marked that is
it is accessible in my ribbon here so
we'll make it accessible and here in the
developer option you have to click on
Visual Basic and then insert user form
then we have module here click on the
module and here we have to paste the VBA
code that will be provided by the chat
jbt as you could see that it has
provided the code and there's another
method that is you just press all plus
f11 and then you will come on the
particular slide here then you have to
go here and use the module and paste it
here so we will copy the VBA
code get back here
paste the code and this is the button
you have to click that is run sub or
user form just click on it and you could
see that it has provided the PowerPoint
presentation so it is the basic
presentation as I have not like
commanded the chat jpt or I have not
modified my prompt accordingly I've just
used the basic prompt that just generate
a basic presentation on how to become an
expert in generative Val so you could
modify a pro accordingly on how you want
your presentation and for the design
thing you could use any template or
layout so we have the design here so you
could use any
design what you
prefer so you would see that it has
applied the design to all the
presentations you could ask the chat
GPT if you want to like have more text
heavy and if you want to generate images
also you would do that with the help of
Del so now moving to the next method on
how we can create ppts or the PowerPoint
using chat gypt this is the one method
that is using the VBA code now moving
back to chat
gbt now here we'll ask
him
that generator PowerPoint pitch deck for
a
topic and that could be any topic you
want
so here we will modify our prompt and
ask him that act as
a as an expert in
CS that would be computer
science and I want him to
generate PowerPoint presentation
that would be pitch
Tech and that would be for
topic let's move to the topic for the
cloud computing
topic on
mastering cloud
computing okay and we will instruct him
that structure the presentation
in the following
Manu in the following sections and now
we can provide him the section that
is
problems faced by Cloud
expert then it could be
skills and then the road map
roles
salary I think that's it and you can
modify accordingly what you want in your
presentation let's see what it will
provide to
us so you would see that it has started
generating it
so what we'll do here is we'll open the
word
here
and we'll paste all the content that has
been provided by the chat jpd and using
the word
only what we'll use here we'll
paste and
we'll use the paste formatting here that
is the merge formatting so first delete
all these
okay now we have the content
here and we don't want this also now mov
to the view outline
and here what we'll
do we will make these like the
titles just get back and use control
Edge we'll find all the slide
titles and replace them with a
space okay and there
are colons also so we have made The
Replacements here
now for the content part also we have to
make that replacement so we'll use the
contr H only and what we have here is
content and we'll replace
it with like nothing that would be empty
only and
subtitle so yeah our Word document is
here now moving to The View
outline and here what we'll do we'll
make all this that is the heading of the
slides we'll select all of
them and make them as level
one and all
the other things
as level two if you see the content it
has not provided us the good content
that it has just provided what things we
can include in the PowerPoint not like
the chat jity has not given us the all
the content that should be included in
the PowerPoint like you could see here
that is in the first slide it has stated
that mastering cloud computing
comprehensive guide and unlocking the
future of technology only it has not
provided us the content and in this is
cloud computing it has said that Define
cloud computing and its importance in
the modern digital landscape it has not
defined for us it has just provided the
definitions so you have to modify a
prompt that I want the whole PP
presentation with all the information or
all
the understandings of the
concepts so you could do
that and
now in the view section only
with this we'll save
this and we'll save this on the desktop
only and name it as
PPM okay now mve to the
PowerPoint and here we'll move to file
blank
presentation and in the new slide we
will click on the option slides from
outline move to the desktop
here we have the ppf file we will insert
it used by another user okay so we'll
close
this and click on
okay we'll do the process again that
insert it and wait for some time till
then it proceeds with that and create
the presentation so you could see here
that it has created the presentation
here that is mastering cloud computing a
comprehensive guide and looking the
future of technology so you could see
that CH GPT has not provided us all the
information it has just drafted how you
could insert information in the slides
so what you can do is you could just go
to chat jbt and ask him that provide all
the informations for the slide one and
then paste it in your word document
accordingly you could do for all the
slides and then save the word document
after doing the level one and level two
headings for the content and after that
you could just come here and in the new
slide section just click on slides from
outline and insert the document that's
it and if you want to design it you
could use any layout or template so with
this guys today we have learned two
methods to create PowerPoint
presentation using Chad j imagine this
you're sitting in a Cozy Corner of your
favorite Cafe sipping on a warm cup of
coffee your laptop is open and within

of CH GPD to start a profitable blog
from scratch step by step I'll walk you
through everything you need to know from
content planning and keyword research to
writing posts and promoting them
effectively so without wasting much time
let's dive into our first step which is
creating a Content plan every successful
blog begins with a wellth thought out
content plan this is where the magic
starts chat GPT can play a pivotal role
in helping you brainstorm and organize
your ideas efficiently imagine sitting
down to create your blog and having a
clear road map of content ideas taor to
your Niche That's The Power of content
plan first determine the niche you're
passionate about whether it's technology
Fitness travel or any other topic once
you have identified your Niche it's time
to leverage CH GPT so as you can see we
have log in our chat GPT and you can
simply ask chat GPT to suggest blog post
ideas for your chosen topic for example
you could type uh suggest blog post
ideas for a tech blog so I'll just
simply type
here and I'll just press enter so as you
can see chat GPT has given some blog
post ideas and these are the topics we
can look into so these ideas are in just
random suggestions they are the building
blocks of your content calendar with
these topics in hand you can plan out
your blog post for the upcoming months
ensuring that your content creation is
consistent and targeted the approach not
only keeps your blog organized but also
helps you stay focused on delivering
value to your audience regularly so now
that we have our content planned in
place it's time to move on to the next
crucial part of the blogging process
this step will ensure that your blog
post will not only reach your audience
but also rank highly on search engine so
you can pick any topic you want from
here support suppose my topic is cyber
security threats in 2024 all right now
the next step is keyword research in the
world of blogging keywords are like GPS
for your content they guide your readers
straight to your blog so the next step
is conducting keyword research keywords
are essential for search engine
optimization which is SEO because they
help your blog rank higher in search
engine result making it easier for your
target audience to find your content
with chat GPT the process becomes
incredibly efficient you can start by
asking chat GPT to generate a list of
potential keywords for your blog for
example uh let's type here give me short
tail and long tail keywords give me
short
tail and long tail keywords for the
particular topic which you have chosen
for example I've chosen this topic which
is cyber security threats in
2024 so I'll just press enter so as you
can see chat GPT will give a list of
short tail keywords and longtail
keywords as well it's important to
validate these keywords using an SEO
tool like Google Keyword Planner so you
can validate these keywords using Google
Keyword Planner so let me show you a
quick demo on how we can search using
Google Keyword Planner so I'll just type
here Google Keyword Planner so as you
can see I'll just simply sign in here so
here this is the interface of Google
Keyword Planner you just have to click
on discover new keywords and you can uh
type anything for example uh the topic
name is cyber security C that's it and
the uh language you have selected is
English and we will click on get results
so as you can see that Google has given
us a list of all the keywords related to
this topic the broad level keywords we
have total 658 keywords ideas available
you can also add filter here and uh
suppose low range high range or exclude
keywords in my account anything you want
to alter and suppose I click your brand
or non-brand keywords suppose you want
keywords for your platform like corsera
code udem you anything so you can just
untick the other brands and then it will
give you the keywords related to that
particular platform and yes these are
the monthly searches and the
competition status everything you can
just simply see from here so these are
the keywords which are having monthly
searches of around 100K to 1 million all
right so you can pick any keyword from
here suppose this is cyber security I'll
just copy paste you can also download
your keywords so this is how you can
search your keywords using keyword
Google Keyword Planner so we'll go back
to chat GPT as you can see these tools
will provide you the valuable data such
as search volume keyword difficulty and
competition level this ensures that
you're targeting the right keywords that
can bring sub stantial traffic to your
blog so by combining the power of chart
GPT with reliable SEO tools you are
setting the foundation for a well
optimized blog that can rank well and
attract the right audience now let's
move on to our next step which is
analyzing content gaps now that we have
understood the content plan and how do
we do the keyword research it's time to
gain a Competitive Edge by analyzing
content Gap so content gaps are
opportunities where your competitors
might be missing out and you can step in
to provide valuable content that fills
those voids so chat GPT can assist you
in this process by helping you to
analyze what top ranking blogs are doing
and how they might be lacking so we can
just simply type a prompt here which is
analyze the content GS suppose
analyze the
content
gaps and you can just mention the
competitor's blog post so we can simply
uh search for that keyword which we have
chosen cyber security and you can see
the first blog post which is from Cisco
what is cyber security so we'll just uh
copy this domain I mean the web address
and here we'll just copy paste and just
simply click enter so as you can see the
chat GB was enable to analyze the
content Gap so we will just uh again we

highlight the areas where you can
improve or expand your content to offer
something unique and comprehensive by
identifying these gaps you can tailor
your blog post to cover topics or angles
that others might have overlooked giving
you a distinct advantage in the crowded
blogging landscape so uh this strategy
not only enhances your content but also
position you as an authority in your
nishe attracting more readers and high
ranking on search engines so as you can
see we can we have uh understood this
step now it's time to move on to our
fourth step which is building topic
clusters to truly establish your blog as
an authorative source in your Niche it's
important to create topic clusters so
topic clusters are groups of related
blog post that revolve around a central
theme this strategy not only helps with
SEO but also provides your readers with
a comprehensive understanding of a
particular subject so using chart GPT
you can easily build these clusters for

clusters for a blog post suppose I just
type a prompt here create topic clusters
for a Blog about cyber
security in
2024 all right so we'll just simply

process where chat gbt can once again be
your invaluable assistance so after

detail structure including headings
subheadings and that you can use as a
blueprint for your post once you have

engaging video content with get Munch or
generating compelling written content
with right Sonic AI is here to help you
every step of the way each tool we have
discussed today harness the power of AI
to bring you smarter more efficient ways
to reach and engage your audience let's
start with our
project and for that first we'll create
a
folder in Python projects
and name it
as
telegram Port using chat
jbd okay and inside this we'll open the
con prompt and open our ID that is I
would be using the video Studio code and
you can use any ID that you have hands
on and now
we will go back to our chat jpd and
we'll start here but before that uh
let's talk about telegram board so a
telegram board is a program that
interacts with users VI the telegram
messaging app uh the prerequisite is you
should have a telegram account and
Boards can be used for a wide range of
purposes such as customer support news
delivery and even games and CH J so chat
GB is a large language model trained by
open that is based on gbt 3.5
architecture and CH jbt is capable of
generating humanik response to text
based inputs making it a great tool for
building chat
boards and now if we talk about
prerequisites you should have a telegram
account python install on your system
and we need a python telegram board
library that I will show you what to
install and that chat Jil tell us like
what to
install so we'll just ask CH
jity to
create telegram
board
using
python okay so it says error we'll just
refresh the
page and ask again create telegram board
using python okay let see
what he States so create a telegram
board you need a
telegram or talking to the board father
yeah we have to go to the board father I
will show you guys how to do
that install the required libraries next
you need to
install okay and write this code
okay so in this
script they have sted with the start
function
so it will just say us
hello when it would be
started
okay so we will add some more
functionalities
and we will ask uh where to find the
your API token here so I know like we
have to go to the board father but we
will ask chity
also where can we
find
the
open so it states that to get to
telegram what AP token you need to
create a new boot by talking to the bo
father on telegram open telegram and
search for board father okay and send
the board father message that is/ newb
and the board father will ask you for
the name of the board and it will ask
you about the username and the fifth is
the boa will then generate a token for
your boat this token is a string of
characters that uniquely identifies your
boat on telegram so keep this token
secure and I will also blur it so you
guys won't be able to see it
okay so moving to our
telegram we'll just search board father
here and you can see this is the board
father and we'll just click on
start and they asked the J asked us to
right/ new mod we'll just click on this
and we'll
get so we write a new board how are we
going to call it please choose a name
for the
board so all
right simply
learn underscore
new board
okay good let's choose an
username so
[Music]
simply
learn one one underscore for boort and
it states that that your username should
end in BO so we have to end it with Bo
and you could see the token here and
here you can just access your
boat so we'll get back to our ID and
create a new file and I will name it as
new. py only or you can name it as
board. P anything you want we'll get
back to
our uh chity but before that first we
need to install the library for that you
can go to the command prompt or you
could use the terminal of your
ID that
is uh in Visual Studio code you you
could use the terminal to install the
libraries you could see that the
requirement is already satisfied as this
library is already installed on the
system so moving back library is
installed and now we'll copy this
code and paste it
here and we will just change the
token we'll go back to board
further we'll copy this
token come back
and paste it
here
okay now we will run this and see
whether our board is working or
not so it has successfully executed
we'll get back to our board fur and just
click on simply 11 one board
so we click on
start and see it says hello I your board
so it's working fine so if we write
hello it won't respond as there are no
functionalities so we will ask jity to
add
functionalities please add some
more functionalities
and
this to the
port let's
see so sure here's an example of how you
can add some more
functionality so they used P updator
dispatcher
okay Define the help command Handler
okay
so Chad je has defined three functions
that is Eco and what does equal do it
will just give you the same thing what
you give to the board or what you write
to the board
caps that he has also declared a help
function and in which you can see like
what functionalities does the board have
and the Caps will do it will convert the
message to all caps Eco uh Eco the
message back to you it will give you the
same message SL start it will start the
board and SL help to get help
and
now unknown uh if there's something you
ask out of these things it will just say
sorry okay I will let you guys
understand this code also but first
we'll see whether it's working or
not so for that we have pasted it here
and we'll paste our API token again
in so we pasted it here now uh first we
will close this terminal
and get a new terminal and then run the
program we'll get back to the
vort father and this is a vort so we'll
just write
slash
start and it says hello I have your
board
now we'll
say hi to the
bot so okay it's not responding
okay we just close the terminal and we
have pasted
the keys also
okay R it
again now we'll see whether it's working
or
not
start hi
so the code is not
working just see the Cod
again okay uh here we don't have any
response to I or l so what we'll do
we'll use the help and to call the help
what we have slel so these are the
commands for what it will
respond so we will use slash
help okay now you can see that SL start
to start the board that we have done
help and
eco eco the message back to you so we'll
write hi don't write back so we'll write
SL equo
High then he has given us the output
that is high so we can write slash equo
how are
you so it has given you back and same we
have slash caps so we'll write slash
caps and we'll write something in small
GS that would
be greatly
built okay now you can see it has
returned in
caps so you can add some more
functionality to it and before that I
will get you guys understood the
code so now we'll see what does this
code do so first we have imported the
necessary modules that is the classes
from the python board library that will
need to create our board so telegram
contains the main board class while
updator command Handler message handle
and filters are classes that we use to
handle incoming updates and messages
from
telegram okay now these are like uh we
have created an instance of the board
class that is using our telegram board
API token as well as an updator instance
that will continuously fetch new updates
from Telegram and pass them to the
appropriate handlers and we have used
context equal to true that tells the
updator to use the new context based API
introduced in version 12 of the Python
telegram board library and we also used
a dispatcher object that will handle
incoming
updates after that we have created a
start function and passed update and
context so we have defined a function
that will handle the start
command and and the update parameter
contains information about the incoming
update from telegram while the context
parameter contains some useful methods
and objects that we can use to interact
with the telegram API in this case we
have used uh context. port. send do uh
sendor message to send a message to the
chat with the ID specified by update.
effective unor chat.
ID and after that we have created a help
function
so we use a multi-line string to define
the help message which contains a list
of available commands and then we have
used the context dobard do sendor
message to send the help message to the
chat and after that we have the Eco
function so we use context. arguments to
get the message sent by the user after
the/ Eco command so to use this we have
to use the SL Sho and after that we have
to write the message and then use join
to join the message back together to a
single string we then uh we have used
the context. board do sendor message to
send the message back to the chat then
we have caps so this function defines
that will handle the Caps command and we
have again used the context to arguments
to get the message sent by the user
after the slash gaps command and then
the we have used the upper function to
convert the message to all gaps and then
we have used the context dobard do
sendor message to send the message back
to the chat then we have unknown
function that is this function defines
that will handle any command that the
board doesn't recognize so we have used
context dop do send so it will just say
sorry okay so these are the start
Handler help Handler Eco Handler and
caps Handler so the these are the
commands and we have the we have added
the ADD handl and to start the board we
have used update do startor
poing so this is how we have created the
boort with the help of python and
jity
so we are done with the project you can
add more functionalities also to the
board you can just ask chat jbd to get
more functionalities to play music in
the telegram board or you could just ask
him how to send messages to a particular
user by the boort only and you could
also send media files ask the media
files from the board and you can train a
fully board by the help of J jpd and
this is called Chad GPT scripting so
with the help of Chad GPD you can just
ask him and he will guide you with all
the codee and processes you just have to
like make them in a sequence and use
them to full of your
use so for that first we'll open the
command
prompt and run the file main for that we
write the command go run main do go so
this is the file that is written in the
go language and we going to run with the
command gun main. go for that you need
to have colang installed on your system
so I will guide you with all the process
but currently we seeing the demo so here
this command will generate a QR code
that will scan with the device which we
want to integrate the chat GPT on so
we'll wait for the file to get executed
and after this we will execute the
server. pyi and that will open the chat
JP on the Firefox browser you can also
use other browsers that is chromium and
other if you want but we'll use Firefox
to skip the onstep verification that
chat J ask us whether if we are a bot or
a human so we'll run the file again as
there was some
error so this time yeah it run perfectly
now we'll take the device and open
WhatsApp on it in which we want to
integrate the chat jpd so I'm using one
device to just capture this QR
code so this is the device and you can
see that my device has captured this QR
code and you can see here that WhatsApp
me
Meo it has been activated so now we'll
run another file that is server. p file
and that is the python file for that
we'll open the command prompt again and
that would be another command prompt and
to run that file we'll write the command
Python server.py
and you can
see in the Firefox browser CH jpt has
opened and I have logged in already so
it didn't it didn't ask me to log in
again now
we will take another device and we
message on the mobile device which has
been integrated with the
charity so from this device I will write
hi and you can see on the screen that
chat JY replies hello how can I assist
you today and the same you could see on
the whatsa chat so today we will ask
chat jpd what is the capital
of India so you can see that the chat
jity is typing the capital of India is
New Delhi and it has been responded to
our mobile device so this is
how we can integrate chat JP on our
WhatsApp and this would be the simple
tutorial in this you don't need to Cod
anying uh this there would be another
tutorial if you know what's behind the
code or what behinds the integration
part so you could watch that video and
know how we have integrated but in this
tutorial I will guide you with how to
download the files and how to run the
files and how you can integrate chat JP
on your device to start integrating chat
jpt on our device so for that first you
have to download this repository and it
contains some files and I will upload
some more files here you just have to
download it download the zip
file and after downloading
it you just need to extract it in a
folder so we'll extract in see Drive in
Python
projects mainly we create the folder
here only so here we'll create a
folder okay integrate CH WhatsApp mean
or yeah right
integrate chat GPD that's it so inside
this folder we'll extract the files and
I think it's been done so we'll just
visit C drive uh python projects and
inside it we have integrate chat JT and
we have these two files so to run these
two files what you need is you need
python install on your system and goang
install on system so I hope you guys
know how to install Python and goink if
you don't I will just give you a quick
tutorial so to download the python you
just need to visit the python.org
website and move to the download section
and you will see the download the latest
version for Windows you just need to
click that and the download will start
for you the package has been downloaded
so I will provide you the link on how to
download the python in the description
box and also the link for the GitHub
repository so you don't have to search
it anywhere also you can search it on
the browser just right integrate CH in
whatsap and abisara you will get the
GitHub link and just write GitHub also
in the search bar you will just redirect
it to
this and now you have downloaded the
python so just open the exe
file and start with the installation so
you can choose at python.exe to path you
can choose that
and customize
installation and just cck on the python
test suit and the next you can add the
python to environment variables so you
have to take both these options and then
you will click on the install as I
already installed it so I won't need to
install it again you just need to click
on the install button and here you will
get the python installed
okay and the other thing you need is
goang go language so to download it you
have to go sorry you have to go to its
official website and go to the download
section and here you will see the
Microsoft Windows as I'm working on the
Windows operating system so I will
download for the windows I've already
downloaded and installed it so you guys
can download it and I will show you like
this is simple how to install goem you
don't need to add anything so it's been
downloaded
it okay to guide through the
installation okay so we are just waiting
for the setup to be initialized so that
we can install
it now you can see the next button is
available just click on that and a
previous version of go programming is
currently installed yes you can see that
it's already installed so you don't need
to do anything in installing the go
language just click on install and it
would be installed for you so I won't be
installing it again as I already
installed on my device so moving on now
what we'll do first we will run the
server. py file so for that we will go
to the folder where we have extracted
our files and here we will open the
command prompt and run the file
server.py so to run a python file we
have to write the command Python and
then the name of the file that is server
and its extension that is py so we have
initiated
that okay uh Firefox is already running
as we have
not closed what we have opened for the
demo I think
uh this an error
I
will
again run the Comm prompt I will just
close the previous command
prompts yeah I have closed them now I
will open the new one and you should
open the command prompt the new command
prompt after installing the Python and
the code language I will also assist you
in installing the GCC compiler because
you would be needing that for go
language
so first we
will run the server
file so you could see that by running
the python server.py file you could see
that the chat GPD has opened up in the
Firefox browser so I will show you the
code what we need for that you need to
install the flask system OS modules
playright
module and here in the 16th line you
could see that we have used Firefox you
could use chromium for Chrome but the
case is you need to do the one step
verification that is the capture thing
for like initializing the CH jpd but we
don't need that so we are using the
Firefox so you should have Firefox on
your system now what I want you to do is
just install these modules as if you if
these modules would not be installed on
your system it would show an error it
would give you an error in the command
prompt only as I've already installed
them so it's not giving me any
error so I will tell you the commands to
install
them so to install flask you can just
write
pypi space flask in any browser and it
will direct to the
website so you could open the first link
that would be pypi dog and this is the
command pip install flask so you can
just copy that and open your command
prom first we'll create it contrl
C
and now you could see that we are in the
folder integrate CH jpd and here you
could paste this command and press
enter it states that that the
requirement is already satisfied as I
have already in install these modules
and the other module you need is play
right so just copy the command go to
your command prompt and paste this
command and press enter it will be
installed for you and another module you
need is virtual environment so just copy
this and paste in your command prompt
and another module you need
is the OS module OS
sys system uh and we'll open the
pypi that is the official website the
PIP command website and you just copy
the command go to your command prompt
paste the command and press enter and
this module would also be installed for
you guys and now you have installed the
go language the Python language and the
modules you need to run the server.py
file now what you need to do is run the
go file but before running the goang
file what you need is GCC compiler so to
download it I will provide you the link
for the GCC or you could just see here
I'll provide you the link in the
description box below you could just
click on that you would be D directed to
this page just click on this release
that was 24th May and what you need to
download is this 64+ 32 bit just
download it and as it gets downloaded
just open
it and click on the create
button and after that the second option
then next and the directory you want to
install in as I already installed
this I will
[Music]
choose the C directory only
in
see I
would install in Python projects
okay okay didn't to the
folder and
see sorry cancel
it in Python projects and in the same
folder that was in cre CH
jbd okay so I'll click on
next not time want to install yes I want
to install here and when you click on
install it would get installed for you
guys I've already installed
it and the process started so it will
get installed
again so now what you have to do is you
have got the all the requirements to
integrate the chat JD on WhatsApp that
is all the modules for the server.py
file and the main.go file for that you
have installed the go language and the
GCC compiler so you could run both the
files and for
that we will close the command prompts
and open the new command
prompts and this is
a folder so we will open one command
prompt here
sorry and we have to open different
command prompts for both the files for
the uh goang file and the python file
okay so we will open the command prom
here
and now to run the goink file we need to
write the command go space run space the
name of the file and the extension that
is main. go and we have executed the
file and this file will provide us with
a QR code and we'll scan this QR code
from our first device in which we want
to integrate the chat jpd and before
that we will run our another file that
is server.py file and for that we'll
open another command
prompt and to run this
command to run this file we'll write the
command python space the name of the
file that is server and the extension
py so we'll see whether a QR code is
generated or
not and I can
see that it's been linked
to the previous device as we have done
in the demo so we haven't logged it out
so I will check with the the device
yeah it's been active so I will just log
out from that
device and run it
again or I will open another command
prompt to run the goang file
again so to run
it we'll open the command prompt and
write the command CMD for that and here
we'll write the command to run the go
file and we have done
that and if we see the server. py
file yeah it has been perfectly
executed uh but we not able to
yeah our chat jity is running fine now
what we have to do
is use our first device to scan this QR
code so that CH J gets linked to our
first device and then we'll use another
device to chat with the chat
jpd so now we have opened our first
device and open the WhatsApp and click
on the link device
and
here we'll scan this
qpod and you can see that it's logging
in now it's logged
in and now from the another
device we'll ask a query to
CH and we will ask Chad jity to write a
code to add two
integers and that to
python so we just misspelled python but
we hope that our J jpd understood that
so here we can see that the J Code the
command and it
has and a good example show here's an
example code to add two integers in
Python
so you can see that chat jity has been
integrated and we'll
see it's response yeah we got the
response and now we'll ask another
question and that would
be what is the currency of United States
let's see what it responds the gry of
United States is the United States
dollar it is the most commonly used
currency in international transaction
and other words primary Reserve currency
so we can see that tet writes all the
lines or
sentences it's been executed on the
browser and after it completes or it
stops generating the answer it sends it
to the WhatsApp chat
so here we are done with a
project now you guys have understood how
to integrate chat JD with WhatsApp and
what you have done is we have downloaded
the repository and we have to extract
all the files that are present in the
repository I will update all the files
you just have to extract them into a
folder and then run the main. go file
and the server.py file and before
executing these files you need to have
goang and python installed on your
system and for the python you need some
modules that we have seen that is the
play right module the flask module the
OS system module and the virtual
environment module so we have seen how
to install them and when you will just
execute the file on the command prompt
you would get errors if these files or
modules are not installed on your system
and for goang we have installed the GCC
compiler and after installing all these
requirements the then you have to just
run both the files and when you run the
goang file you will get the QR code just
scan it with your device on which you
want to integrate that J and after that
from any device you can just message on
that number on which you have integrated
the chat jpt and the chat jpt would
answer all your queries we are going to
automate WhatsApp using python by pyot
kit library and with the help of chat J
and before starting I have a quiz
question for you
guys and your question is how much did
meta that is formerly Facebook spend to
acquire WhatsApp in 2014 and your
options are your first option is do $10
million second option is $19 million
third option is $20 billion and the
fourth option is $21 billion please
answer in the comment section below and
we'll update the correct answer in the
pin comment you can pause the video give
it a thought and answer in the comment
section so moving
on now we'll move to create a
project so first we will create a folder
for a
project and for that we will create a
folder in Python projects
and we name it as automate
WhatsApp using chat
jbd okay and inside this we'll open the
command
prompt and open our
ID that is we want to automate WhatsApp
using Python and with the help of chat
jbd we won't write the code on our own
we will ask chat jbd to automate
it we will create the file and name it
as
main.py and now we'll move to chat
jpt and ask chat JP to write a code to
send messages through WhatsApp using
Python and the pivot kit Library so we
will give a command send message through
WhatsApp
using Python
and pivote
kit let's see what chat CH responds to
us and we have also created the automate
WhatsApp using python video I will just
link it in the I button you can can
check that out and we'll see
what chat jpd tells us
okay country code
message minutes yeah it could
work and first you need to install the
pivot kit
Library by Running P inst pivate kit in
terminal or command prompt okay replace
Target phone number with the Target
phone number you want to send the
message to country code with the country
code of the Target phone number message
with the message you want to send r with
the r in 24hour format and you want to
send message and minute with the minute
you want to send the message okay for
example yeah
okay all it so we'll copy this
code
and
paste in our ID but before for that
first you need to install the pivot kit
library and for that you can go to the
command prompt and write the
command
pip space install
space pivote kit and press
enter it states that the requirement is
already satisfied as I've already
installed this module and you can
install it by writing the simple command
and you'll get it installed and if you
face any error installing it just
command down and we would be very happy
to resolve your
queries okay
so as Jad jbd States we'll just enter
the things it want from us so it's
asking the the Target phone number and
the country code without plus
sign
okay so here we'll
just WR all the things but uh as you can
see it has also given us an example to
see and work on the code
so
here we'll just clear
it I will write the phone number to whom
I want to send the
message so it would
be and I would just blur this number so
you guys won't be able to see okay and
here we'll just add the country code
and that is without plus
sign
okay so my country code
is you can search it that is I live in
India and the message I want to send to
him
is
hello how are
you and
now we'll set
the hour and minute so the current time
is
154 so we'll
set 16
okay we'll save
this and run it
so it says that the country code
ising so we
just copy the error and give it to chat
jbd as we are taking the Heth of chat JD
in this video so he has given us the
code so we'll just provide the error to
him let's see what it states if it's not
able to resolve this then we will
resolve
it indic country code in the phone
number you're trying to send
okay this and the country code is 91 to
send the message correctly you need to
make

okay 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
you
mention in the person the provided phone
number is this and the country code is

understand how to create ebook for that
let's move on to the browser and
understand all right so now this is our
browser now let's understand how to
create the content of ebook using chat
gbt which is our AI tool so we'll go to
chat GPT so now here we will be writing
a prompt to write the content of ebook
now it's up to you on which content you
want to write it it can be in your
domain also and it can be something in
which you have the interest you have the
passion and you are good at it for
example let's say somebody's good at the
knowledge regarding cars or regarding
bikes or regarding anything he must he
or she must have the value to provide to
the audiences that content he should
write the ebook on for example so let's
take an example like I'm writing an
ebook on how to make money online right
so what should I write so I'll start
with writing the prompt just a second
there we go
write
an ebook
for
titled how to make money
online featuring the AI
generated images for each
chapter this ebook
will contain eight
pages and six
chapters divided into six chapters
all right so let's have a look what we
have written we have written is write an
ebook for people out there titled how to
make money online in which we are
featuring the AI generated images of
each chapter for each chapter so that it
will be easy for people to understand it
now this ebook will contain eight pages
so I've instructed charity to create
eight pages divided into six chapters
each chapter will be explained in
humanlike Manner and long paragraphs it
should be long paragraphs also use AI
generated images in between the chapter
for the better explanation so let's see
what the result it gives
us all
right chapter one is freelancing and we
can see it is not able to generate the
images we'll do something about it
definitely blogging and content creation
online service and market research
selling products online affiliate
marketing online tutoring and courses so
six chapters are there all right so Chad
GPT has given us all the chapters that
we have asked Chad GPT for now we want
it the images also like AI generated
images also so let's write a prompt for
it as we are not able to see the
images so I'm writing where are the AA
generated images that I asked
for I'm not able to see those images all
right now let's see so here CH gbt is
giving us I believe it gives us
chapterwise images all right so it is
giving us chapter wise images here is
the air generated image for chapter one
freelancing let's proceed with generated
image for the remaining chapters all
right so it is showcasing the
freelancing people are doing freelancing
and online service and Market research
okay though these people are doing
online research and market research
online service and this is blogging and
content creation as we can see these all
our air generated images that we asked
for and now we can use each of these
images in between the ebooks selling
products online affiliate products and
online tutoring and courses the images
what I think the images is pretty well
that I expected now you re how to make
online includes a images for each
chapter all right so what we asked for
chat gbt it gave us sometimes it happens
that what you ask it doesn't give at the
first time then you then you'll have to
write the another prompt for it as we
did right now all right now the thing is
we want all these images to be inside
this one in this doc not this doc but
this what we call ebook that we have
written so let's ask Chad gbt if it can
include it in between can you include
these
images in between the
chapters
above and then show it to
me let's see if it can do that otherwise
we can also do that but let's ask chgb
first all right I don't think it is able
to do that we might have to write
another prompt for it but rather than
that let's just use use this also this
only we'll
use anyways we have got the links for we
have got the photos for each chapter so
we don't need to worry about that so
without worrying about this we'll move
on to the next step which is compile all
the tables chapters and images into a
file that we want so this file can be
PDF file also can be dog file also or in
any other format so let's just
write compile
the
tables
chapters
properly
images properly into a document
file all
right I think Chad gbt is saying I'll
convert all the images to PNG format and
then add them to the document so let's
just add another let's just stop it and
just copy paste this one and we'll be
adding another prompt so that we can
tell chat gbt that use this format
instead of that one that it is
suggesting we can write that convert the
images into a specified format like we
can write
convert the images into jpeg
format now let's
see all right so as we can see see chj
has given the answer I have compiled the
document with converted JP f is properly
integrated you can download the evok
using the link below so you'll click on
this file to download it and as we can
see it is getting downloaded and let's
just open this
file as we go word automatically saved
images to the normal document template
do you want to load it yes let's
see okay so this is the ebook that chat
gbd has created you guys must know that
anything that we have written inside it
is not on our own Chad gbt helped us in
writing all of this content and we can
see how properly it is written the color
scheme and all and this is how to make
money online so now we can also make the
changes in between the profit of writing
the document in Word is that only we can
always convert this document into PDF by
going to various sites but let's just
create first in the document file so
that you can also do editing and changes
and if you want to add something then
also you can easily do that so that's
why we have created into the document
format so as we can see freelancing then
there is the image as we can see we can
also resize it all right as you can see
we have resized it so this way you can
also edit it and whatever you like I
mean it's up to you it's it's very
subjective to people what they want to
do for their ebook so it's up to them if
they want to add something in more
detail or they can also Showcase with
the help of an example then they can
definitely do that and after all the
editing is done then they can you know
go for the PDF format it it is very easy
to convert doc into PDF by going to
various sites so as you can see we are
resizing the images and according to me
the images are well I mean what expected
is it is better than that and it is also
you know showcasing what we want what we
what we are explaining over there so
yeah as you can see conclusion is also
there introduction is also there so you
don't need to worry about that as well
and another thing is let's say uh I want
to change it a bit like let's say online
service and market research is there
then there is blogging and content
creation is there but I think this
blogging and content creation content is
bit like not that explainable I want it
to elaborate more then what will I do is
we simply copy paste it or you can use
from chat gbt also we have copied it and
now we'll go to chat GPT all right now
I'll write the prompt I want
you to
explain it in more
detail so
that people can
easily understand it
now I'll copy paste I'll paste the
content that I want to
more I want charity to more explain
explain it in an elaborated way so here
it is blogging apart to sharing earning
choosing your Niche setting up your blog
creating high quality content monetize
your blog and advertising sponsored post
everything everything there are various
points there are five points that CH gbt
has WR and now what I'll do is I'll just
simply copy it let's say I've copied it
now I'll go back to the dock this is the
dock and I'm just showing the example
right I'll just paste it now let's
see all right online
service and this is blogging and content
creation so automatically as we can see
number of points we have written and
this is the link that it has added
and basically we got the format
basically all these things are done so
we don't need to worry about that even
we want to make any changes it is very
easy to do that as we have just saw now
the next thing that we want to focus on
is the mockup or the cover photo or the
mockup photos for that basically we want
to Market this digital product this
ebook we want to Market it so what we'll
do is we'll have to create a cover or
mockup so there are many ways to to do
that and as we told you that we will be
creating this free of cost how to do all
these thing in free so we'll go to canva
all right now we'll write a prompt uh
what prompt should we write we write
create a AI
generated uh poster image let's write
create an AI
generated
poster image
for ebook that I can use
as a cover for
it all right this is how to make money
online
so okay we don't want the entire cover
photo but yeah so
don't give me
the entire cover
photo just generate AI
generated
image images for mockup for
ebook no we already have this kind of a
thing over
here create few
more only create image and not the
background is creating some more images
let's wait for
those give me the inside
image for the
last four go to so basically you have to
manipulate chat to give you the exact
thing that you are asking for so for
that you have to write multiple times
The Prompt sometime it happens so it's
pretty normal so don't just get
frustrated with that
I think this one is better anyways it is
not getting us what we want can you
convert this
by mistake I wrote something else
downloadable I want to write I think it
is converting it all right so to create
a mockup now what we'll do is we'll
basically go to the mockups here we can
see this is the template this is apps
inside apps we'll go to mockups as we
can see we'll click on this now we have
to select the mockup we want to create
so let's have a look at it so there are
pro also there are normal one also it's
up to you which you want to
select let's select this one and let's
get started we'll select the image that
we just downloaded it so upload it I
believe this is the
image sorry this is the
image and it is
uploaded yeah but the size of the image
is bit small right so we'll have to make
it in portrait or
something let's see if something is
there code interpreter session expired I
believe we we have to create another
one so let's say we want to download
this we have to make sure it is in the
JP
format so it is downloaded now we'll go
over here and delete this one
select
upload I believe this will fit let's see
yeah it is looking bit good than the
previous one
and let's see save mockup so this is how
you can create a mockup for your digital
product your digital ebook and then you
can easily download it so once you have
downloaded it you can put it into use
now the next thing is how you can Market
it that is the next challenge for that
you have to go to the free websites that
can that lets you to upload all the your
ebooks and sell it there are many
websites some are paid and some are free
also but before moving there let me tell
you guys the version of Chad GPD that
I'm using is chat GPD 4 you can also do
the same thing with chat gbt 3.5 also
but it doesn't give you the feature of
downloading all these images or
whatsoever you want so for that you
don't have to worry all you have to go
is to go on
canva and we click on it and now here
you can see there are many things now
the first thing you do is you have to
get the ebook template so you'll search
for ebook and you can select the ebook
template whatsoever you want you can
select as per your choice for example
let's see this one this one is free so
you can customize this template and then
you can copy paste from chat gbt as chat
gbt 3.5 doesn't give you the feature to
download all these things so all you
have to do is just copy all these the
all the content that we
previously done and just paste it over
here and you can also add page or
something like that so it is very easy
you can you know addit this so it'll be
easy for you and then you can download
it so you don't have to worry if you
don't have the paid version of chat gbt
you can easily do that in with the help
of canva so you don't have to worry
about that now coming to the part where
we were explaining how to Market it how
to sell it and where to sell it
basically so for that we'll go to a site
insta Mojo So it allows you to you know
create your own digital product and sell
it free of coost so for that we'll log
in it's pretty simple and so once we
have logged in so we have to fill up the
details so basic detail it is very easy
you can easily fill up the details as it
is showing payment collection is not
enabled on your account so I'm showing
you the demo of it so that's why I've
not done that but it is very easy and
it's free of of course so it is very
easy for you guys as well so once you
have done the sign up and all as you can
see shortcuts add a product digital file
even ticket manage store categories
there are many things not only ebooks
you can Market over here there are many
things you can do right so for that what
we'll do is we'll go to add a product
digital file so our digital product is
our ebook for that we have created a
mockup that we have downloaded it from
canva this one so now we have the this
option of adding a product so you can
see I'm a coffee like this you can do
you can set the price and you can put in
the account details so people who are
interested in can easily buy the product
from you so it is very easy and it is
also showing physical product digital
file even tickets others so as we know
in digital file it is showing ebooks
digital art software or any file that
can be downloadable we'll click on this
and then you can easily upload the file
so once we we have uploaded then we can
here add the image product image that is
the our mockup that we have
curated all right so now it is done and
once you have uploaded that you can also
product video YouTube videos are only
available on the growth plan then the
title of it the description of it the
price that you want to sell it for the
fixed price and discounted price that is
optional and limit the number of
downloads per buyer so you can easily do
all these things it is very easy you
don't have to worry about that and all
these features are there then in the end
you can just Market it so using chat gbt
you can easily create money and we have
showcased this with the help of a fine
example all you have to do is to just
implement the things that I suggested
you on your own and you have to add the
account details that I can't do you have
to do it yourself on the instam Mojo
where you can freely do that it is very
easy you have to put in your account
details and that is done and for the
people who are thinking that they don't
have the paid version of Chad gbt you
don't have to worry about that as I told
you using the non-paid version of chat
gbt also you can do the same thing that
I've done but you can download the
content that I did previously for that
you can just copy paste the content and
put it into the canva so canva has the
this template of ebook all you have to
do is just paste it over there and then
download it from there and I have also
shown you how to create mockups and all
so you don't have to worry all the
things are there available for you all
you have to do is just put in the work
and do what you want to do thanks guys
