topic learning objectives welcome to
math refresher linear
algebra in this lesson we are going to
explain the concepts of linear algebra
solve a linear system of equations
describe Matrix forms of Matrix and
Matrix operations and Define vectors and
list down its properties introduction to
linear
algebra linear algebra linear algebra
refers to study of linear combinations
for linear transformations to be carried
out a study of vector spaces lines and
planes as well as some mappings as
necessary it contains linear functions
vectors and matrices it is an
examination of character characteristic
of linear set
Transformations linear equations linear
algebra's major goal is to establish
systematic techniques for solving
systems of linear
equations a linear equation with n
variables can be represented as A1 X1
plus A2 X2 plus A3 X3 and so on till a n
xn equals to B where X1 X2 X3 and so on
till xn are the unknown quantities that
are to be found while A1 A2 A3 and so on
until a in are the
coefficients B here is a constant term a
linear equation with two variables X and
Y is a linear connection between X and Y
the value of one variable often Y is
determined by the value of the other
that is X the independent variable in
this situation is X while the term
dependent variable refers to Y since it
depends on X let's consider some
examples for linear
equations linear equations in one
variable can be written as 3x + 5 = 0 or
3x 2 of x + 7 = to 0 or 98x = to
49 linear equations in two variables
examples can include y + 7 x = 3 or 3 a
+ 2 B = 5 6 x + 9 y - 12 = to 0 linear
equations can also be written with three
variables as x + y + z = to 0 a - 3 B =
to C 3x + 12 y = to half of Zed
identifying linear and nonlinear
equations
linear equations present themselves as a
straight line on a graph however
nonlinear equations represent themselves
as a non-straight line on the
graph here equations like y = 8x -
9 or y + 3x -1 = to 0 are examples of
linear
equations however y = 2x^2 - 7 is a
nonlinear equation because X is raised
to the^
2 hence denoting a nonlinear
relationship or a non-straight line
relationship between X and
Y similarly Square < TK of y + x = 2 6
or Y raised to the^ 2 - x = to 9 are
examples of nonlinear equations as Y is
raised to the power half and two
respectively forms of linear equation
linear equations can be represented in
three forms a standard form a slope
intercept form or a point slope
form linear equation in standard form a
linear equation in standard form for a
single variable can be represented as a
x + b equals to Zer where A and B are
real integers and X is the variable
while a linear equation in standard form
for two variable can be represented as
ax + b y = 2 C where a B and C are real
integers while X and Y are the
variables to summarize a linear equation
for variables can be written as ax + b y
equal to C where X and Y are the
variables C is the constant and a and b
are the coefficients of X and Y
respectively linear equation in the
slope intercept form a linear equation
slope can be calculated to see how one
variable varies in response to a unit
change in another variable it is
represented as y = to mx + b where m is
the slope B is The Intercept on the Y
AIS and X and Y are the line's distance
from the X and the Y AIS
respectively consider this example
example the lines point x y represents
the distance from the X and the Y AIS
respectively while the line intercept on
the Y AIS is at 0 comma
B linear equation slope the slope
indicates how steep a line is with
respect to Y AIS when seen from left to
right it indicates whether the line goes
up or down
the slope describes how independent
variable has been changed while the
dependent variable is
changing types of slope there are four
types of slopes based on the
relationship between the two variables X
and Y the first is the positive slope
here as X
increases Y is also increasing in a
negative slope as X increases y
decreases if a line is parallel to xais
it is a zero
slope on the other hand if the line is
parallel to Y AIS then the slope is
undefined linear equation in point slope
form a straight line is represented in
point slope form by its slope and a
point on the
line it is represented as y - y1 = to M
of x - X1
where X1 and y1 are the coordinates of
the
point linear equation forms some
examples consider solving the linear
equation given as 2x - 10 / 2 = 2 3x
-1 first we will clear the
fraction in this example we can see only
left hand side we have 2x - 10 / 2
if from the numerator we take two as
common we will be left with 2 * x - 5 /
2 hence x - 5 on the left hand side on
the right hand side we still have 3 * x
- one now as a part of next step we
simplify both sides of the equation that
has open up the brackets when we do that
on the right side we end up getting 3x -
3 by multiplying 3 3 to x
-1 solving further we can write as X =
3x + 2 finally we try to clear the
fraction to solve for x we can rearrange
the equation as x - 3x = to
2 solving it further we get - 2x = to
2 and then we solve for x as
minus1 system of linear equation a
system of linear equations is a finite
collection of linear equations usually
involving the same variables it can be
represented as a11 X1 plus A1 2x2 and so
on equals to B1 a21 X1 + A2 2x2 so on
equals to B2 and so on here this example
is for n
variables a system of M
equations a linear system can have
unlimited number of solutions one
solution or no solution at all in case
of a single linear equation a consistent
linear system has a solution while an
inconsistent linear system has no
solution solving a linear
equation solving linear system of
equations various methods can be used to
solve linear system of equations which
include graphic method substitution
method linear combination or elimination
method or a matrix
method graphing method let's try and
solve these two linear equations using
the graphic method the first equation is
defined as y =
0.5x + 2 and the second equation is y =
to -2X - 3 the two equations as we can
see are in the slope intercept form the
first line has a slope of 0.5 and a y
intercept of pos2 while the second line
has a slope of -2 and a y intercept of
-3 let's have a look at these lines
through a
plot here the blue line is the first
line represented by y = 2.5 x +
2 and the red line is repres resented by
y = to -2X
-3 these two lines intersect at a point
at -2 comma
1 hence we can say that x equal to -2
and Y equals to
1 solving systems of linear equation
using
substitution for substitution we start
by putting one of the equations in the
form a variable equals
2 we then substitute that variable in
the other equation in its place take the
other equation to
solve if there are more than two
variables involved we repeat the process
from steps 1 through
3 Let's consider an
example let's consider the equation 3x +
2 y = 19 and x + y = 8 we could begin
with any equation and variable in this
case let's look at the second equation
with variable
y we start with subtracting X from both
sides of x + y = to
8 and we end up getting y = to 8 -
x the first equation still retains its
form now we take the value of y that is
8 - x and substitute in the first
equation in place of
Y we end up getting the equation 3x + 2
* 8 - x = to
19 we further simplify and solve this
equation using algebra method to get 3x
+ 16 - 2x =
290 we solve this equation further and
we end up getting x + 16 = to 19 and
finally X = to 3
now we take the value of x and
substitute in the new reformed second
equation as y equal to 8 -
x that gives us y = to 8 - 3 hence y =
to 5 The Final Answer remains X = to 3
and Y = 5 solving systems of linear
equation using elimination in this case
we start by multiplying an equation by a
constant anything other than
zero we then add or subtract an equation
onto the other
equation let's consider the same example
of 3x + 2 y = to 19 and x + yal
8 we first start by multiplying the
second equation by two and we get 2x + 2
y =
216 now we subtract the second equation
from the first
equation that is 3x -
2x 2 y - 2 Y and 19 -
60 on solving this we end up getting X =
to
3 Now using these steps of substitution
we put the value of x in the original
second equation that is X+ y = to
8 and achieve a value of y = to 5
hence the answer remains x = 3 and Y =
5 we can verify the solution by using
the
graph here again the Blue Line
represents the point at which 3x + 2 y =
to 19 is true while the red line
represents the point where X+ y = to 8
is
true the solution is found at the point
where X = to
3 and Y = to
5 this is the point where both lines
intersect introduction to
matrices
Matrix a matrix is rectangular array or
table with rows and Columns of numbers
symbols Expressions used to represent a
mathematical object or an
attribute for example here a a is a
matrix of two rows and three columns as
2 1 3 minus 1 2 and 4 well B is a
squared Matrix with two rows and two
columns given as 2 1 3 4 Matrix size The
Matrix size is expressed as M cross n
where m is the number of rows and N is
the number of columns a matrix with two
rows and three columns can be referred
to as 2x3 Matrix or a 2 cross3 Matrix or
a matrix of Dimension 2
cross3 notation of a matrix a matrix
with M rows and N columns can be
presented as
this here each element will be
identified by its row number and column
number for example the element over here
is in the third row and the First
Column hence it is ident identified as a
31 forms of Matrix The Matrix is termed
as a squared Matrix if n equals to M
that is the number of rows and number of
columns are
equal an element's entry in The Matrix
of from a i i is located on the
diagonal hey is called a diagonal matrix
if hey I equals to
Z when I is not equals to
J that is in a square
Matrix apart from diagonal at all places
we have zero as a value Matrix
operations addition addition of two
matrices is adding their corresponding
elements as in a11 + b11 a12 + B12 a 21
+ B2 2 1 a22 plus B22 and so on consider
the example over here we have a matrix a
as 22 32 11 16 and Matrix b as 13 8 13
and 16 Matrix a is of the order 2 cross
2 and Matrix B is also of the same order
2 cross 2 hence the corresponding
elements can be quickly added as 22 +
13 32 + 8 11 + 13 and 16 + 16 giving us
the result in Matrix of 35 40 24 and
32 addition rules only matrices with the
same size can be
added that is the two matrices should
have same number of rows and same number
of columns Matrix addition follows
commutative property that Means A + B is
equals to B +
a
subtraction Matrix subtraction is same
as Matrix
addition it is subtracting the
corresponding
values let's consider the same example
of Matrix A and B the result of a minus
B can be given as 22
-3 that is a11 -
b11 32 - A 8 that is a12 - B12 11 - 13 a
21 - B21 and 16 - 16 that is a22 -
B22 giving us result as 9 24 -2 and
0 subtraction rules only matrices with
the same number of rows and columns can
be
subtracted Matrix subtraction does not
follow commutative
property that means a minus B is not
equals to B minus
a
multiplication matrix multiplication
results in what is called as a product
Matrix in matrix
multiplication each row of the first
Matrix is Multiplied to each column of
the second
Matrix to compute each of these element
in the matx matx the values are then
added for example consider the Matrix A
and
B to get the first element we will
multiply the first row of Matrix a to
the First Column of Matrix
B and then add the individual elements
that is 22 multiply to 13 and 32
multiply to 13 and then add them up to
get this particular
element for the second element we
multiply the first row of a to the
second column of B hence getting 22
multiplied to 8 + 32 multiplied to
16 similarly we compute all the
remaining elements that is the second
row multiplied to the First Column and
added 11 multiplied to 13 + 16 * to 13
and the second row now multiplied to the
second column that is 11 * to 8 + 16
multiplied to
16 this gives us the resulting Matrix as
702
688
351 and
344 multiplication
rules let us say C equals to
AB here C is our product Matrix
which can be computed as summation over
a i j.
bjk for a matrix of size i j Matrix B of
size
JK to calculate the value of each
member in the I cross K Matrix of
C the matrix product AB is defined only
when the number of columns in a equals
to the number of rows in
B the the matrix product of ba is
defined only when the number of columns
in B is equals to the number of rows in
a a do B is not always equals to b.
a
transpose a transpose is a matrix form
by turning all the rows of a given
Matrix into the columns and vice
versa the transpose of a matrix a is
denoted as a T for example
if the Matrix a is 22 32 11 and 16 the
transpose of a would be 22 11 32 and
16 here we can see the row has been
converted to
column inverse if it is a non- singular
Square
Matrix there exists n cross n Matrix a
minus one known as A's
inverse that satisfi a. a inverse equals
to A inverse. A equals to
I where I is the identity
Matrix and identity Matrix is
characterized as a diagonals one and all
other elements are
zero also AB equals to b.
a equals to I in where I in denotes the
N cross n identity Matrix
special Matrix types symmetric Matrix a
matrix a is set to be symmetri if a is
equals to transpose of a diagonal matrix
a matrix D is diagonal only if D J
equals to zero for all I not equals to J
identity
Matrix identity Matrix is denoted as I
in where Ain equals to i. AAL 2
a tensors tensors are arrays with more
than two
axes a tensor can have in dimensions a i
j k is the value in the tensor a at
coordinates J and K the principal
component analysis
PCA which is a statistical technique
used to reduce the number of dimensions
in a given data set while we preserve
its
variability so there are different use
cases of PCA in realtime scenarios one
of the major use case is in the healthc
care domain so a technically known as
the spike triggered covariance analysis
it uses the principle of PCA in
Neuroscience to identify the specific
properties of a stimulus that increase a
neuron's probability of generating an
action
potential so it is using reduction
techniques which is going to be really
helpful in detecting the coordinated
activities of large neuronal
ensembles so it is basically used for
identifying a neuron from the shape of
its action potential then in terms of
quantitative Finance so PCA help us in
reducing the dimensionality of a complex
problem let's say a fund manager has 200
stocks in his portfolio now to analyze
these stocks quantitatively a stock
manager manager will require a
correlational metric of a size 200x 200
which makes the problem very
complex however if he has to extract 10
principal components which best
represents the variance in the stock
price this will reduce the complexity of
the problem while still explaining the
movement of all 200 stocks so we use it
for analyzing the shape of the yield
curve in terms of forecasting the
portfolio returns de developing the
asset allocation algorithms and so on
and it is also widely used in image
compression so PCA is also used for
image compression so if we go ahead and
use any of the py charm IDE so here we
can work with Matt plot lib image Pi
plot and the numpy as NP and here we can
also import from sklearn and we can
import the PCA so basically we are
trying to print the shape of the image
by reading the image this is a sample
logo.png which has been placed in the
same directory we are trying to print
the image so if we run this particular
code then we will be able to see the
shape of the image return to us first
the current shape based on the image
which has been deducted which is
156 94 and three so what does this mean
this means image is in the form of 15 56
rows and each row containing 194 pixels
and then having three channels which is
red green and blue so we had to resize
the image so that it is in a format
required for PCA input which is 196x 3
which is going to be
582 so here we can see we have performed
a simple operation as image R where we
are using the numpy library for
reshaping the image
and then we are printing the shape of
the image again so here we can see
156 and
582 has been returned as a response now
running the PCA with 32 principal
components we can use this fit for the
image that has been reshaped and then we
are trying to train the transform image
so with these 32 components we are able
to express
98.7% of the variance so inverse
transform the PC output and reshaping
the visualization can also be done
forward and that's how PCA is widely
used as a part of the medical and the
other Sciences for example is used for
object detection model for the
healthcare domain for the transportation
Aviation and location based Services
introduction to
vectors objects with both magnitude and
direction are called as vectors the
magnitude of the vector determines its
size it is represented as a line with an
arrow where the length of the line
indicates the vector's magnitude and the
arrow points in the desired Direction
other names for it include ukian Vector
geometric Vector spatial vector or
simply
Vector its length is indicated by the
symol double bar vble bar and it begins
at the original 0 comma 0 notation of a
Vector a vector can be represented in a
standard form as a equal to a I cap plus
b j cap plus CK cap where a B and C are
numeric values the unit vectors along
the XY Z axis are i j and kcap
