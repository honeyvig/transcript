hey everyone i am bravo khandalwal and i
welcome you all to simply learns youtube
channel in this session we will discuss
floyd warshall algorithm then we will
discuss algorithmic solution to all
pairs shortcut path problem
finally we will implement the floyd
warshall algorithm to solve all pairs
shortest path problem in the code editor
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell icon below so you
never miss an update from simplylearn's
youtube channel
so without any further ado let's get
started with the topic what is floyd
warshall algorithm the floyd washer
algorithm is for solving the all pair
shorted path problem
the problem is to find the shortest
distance between every pair of vertices
in the given edge weighted directive
graph
now let's discuss the algorithmic
solution to the all pairs shortest path
problem
first we will initialize the solution
matrix the same as the input graph
matrix
then the solution matrix is then updated
by treating all vertices as intermediate
vertices
our main goal is to pick all vertices
one by one and update all shortest paths
that involves the picked vertex as
intermediate vertex
we have now discussed the fluid partial
algorithm
and the algorithmic solution to all
pairs shortest path problem
now let's implement the solution in the
code editor choose from over 300 in
demand skills and get access to 1000
plus hours of video content for free

the link in the description to know more
we will start by defining vertices we
will have four vertices so
hashtag define inf which will be equal
to 9999
now let's write a function to print the
solution matrix
so void
print
solution
with the argument as
and
a two dimensional array
test
with its y as v
we will come back to its definition
later on
now we will write a function to solve
all pair shortest path problem using
floyd varshall algorithm so void
floyd warshall
and graph
this will also be the 2d array
which has y as v
now we will define dist 2d array
it will be the output matrix that will
finally have the shortest distances
between every pair of vertices
so end
test
its x and y will be
v
comma i comma j comma k
now we will initialize the solution
matrix same as input graph matrix
or we can say that the initial value of
shortest distance are based on shortest
paths considering no intermediate vertex
so for
i is equal to zero
i less than capital v
i plus plus
another nested loop
for
j is equals to zero
j less than v
j plus plus
so distance
at i comma j
will be equals to
graph
at i
comma j
now we will add all vertices one by one
to the set of intermediate vertices so
before start of an iteration we will
have the shortest distances between all
pairs or vertices such that the shortest
distance considering all the vertices is
set from 0 to k minus 1 as intermediate
vertices
and after the end of an iteration vertex
number
k is added to the set of intermediate
vertices
and the set becomes from 0 to k
so for loop
k is equals to
0
k less than v
k plus plus
now we will pick all vertices as source
per one by one
i is equals to zero
i less than v
i plus plus
now we will pick all vertices as a
destination for the above picture source
so for
j is equals to zero
j less than capital v j
plus plus
now if vertex k is on the shortest path
from i to j
then we will update the value of
distance i comma j
so if
distance
at i comma j
is greater than
distance
at i
comma k
plus
distance at
k
comma j
and
distance
at
k
comma j
is not
equals to inf
and
distance
at
i
comma k
is also not equals to
inf
then
distance
at i
comma j
will be equals
to distance
at
i
comma k
plus
distance
at
k
comma j
now we will call the print solution
function
for test
now let's write the utility function to
print solution so void print solution
and
test we will start with c out the
following matrix will show
the
shortest distance
between
every
pairs
of vertices for loop and i is equal to 0
i less than capital v
i plus plus for loop
and
j is equal to 0
j less than v
j plus plus
if
distance
at i
comma j
is equals to inf
then we will see out
inf
else
we will see out
the distance
at i
comma j
now we will see out
and l
this will change the row for the matrix
now let's write the main block so we
will define the matrix as int
graph
v comma v
which will be equals to
zero comma 5
comma
inf
comma 10
next row
inf
comma
0 comma 3
comma inf next row inf comma inf comma 0
comma 1
last row inf comma inf
comma inf comma zero
now we will call the floyd warsaw
function so floyd
warshall for argument graph let's
execute this as you can see we are
getting an updated matrix which shows
the shortest distance between every pair
of vertices and this was all for today's
