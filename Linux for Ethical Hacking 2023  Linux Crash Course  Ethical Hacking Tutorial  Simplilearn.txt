foreign
and welcome to today's video on Linux
for ethical hacking if you have never
used Linux before and are looking to get
into it this is the perfect opportunity
for you to learn on how you can use this
operating system in your daily lives now
although this video is specifically
catered towards people who are trying to
get into cyber security or who are
trying to learn ethical hacking the more
people that get into Linux is that much
easier because it just provides an
alternative operating system that you
can use and perform in your day-to-day
lives now uh it's very important
especially for ethical hackers to
understand how Linux works and
specifically how Kali Linux works that
we are going to cover today
now as Kali Linux is also an operating
system dedicated specifically to cyber
security analysts and hackers and has a
bunch of tools that makes the process of
ethical hacking and vulnerability
analysis malware analysis very easy
so in this Linux crash course we will
learn everything about car Linux what it
is what you can use it for then
understanding a bit more of the Linux
system fundamentals now that can span
across a multi a variety of topics for
the Linux fundamentals we often have how
to navigate the file system how we can
use the Linux operating system command
terminal for creating editing and just
manipulating files will understand some
networking commands that can help you
we'll understand how this uh the service
mechanism how to start store start
Services stop services will understand
how to install uninstall some particular
tools will also create a small script
with bash so that you can understand how
you can use the bash language to start
your scripting journey in Carl Linux
directly before we move forward let's
check out the ceh certification course
by simply learn if you want to learn
more about cyber security and ethical
hacking in general check out our CH
certification training course the
certified ethical hacker certification
is the industry standard for train
penetration testers and our training
program will ensure you are well
equipped with all the necessary skills
and techniques required to Ace the exam
we'll get an exam voucher for free with
the course allowing you to learn master
and Excel as a penetration tester with a
single package you can find the link for
the course in the description box below
that being said we can get started with
our demonstration now the first thing we
need to understand is how we can install
Linux properly to install Linux or Kali
Linux to be specific in this case we
will need two things one we need the ISO
file which is basically the installation
file of every single operating system
and we will need an environment to run
it in now many people
um use Linux or any other operating
system as a dual boot in the system so
that when you start up your computer or
a laptop it will ask you where do you
want to boot into do you want to boot
into Windows or color Linux or Ubuntu
something like that but for easier
access what many people prefer and many
people will recommend is using a
virtualization software so what that
will happen is you will keep using your
normal Windows operating system but you
can use virtualization software like
virtualbox or VMware to run Linux
operating systems in Windows directly it
will run in a sandboxed environment
which makes it easier to learn and you
don't have to dedicate another
bootloader access and it just gets a
whole lot complicated dual booting is a
lot more complicated and it is recommend
it is recommended for beginners to just
stick with virtualization software now
for virtualization software you will get
two options here which will be virtual
Box by Oracle or
VMware
now I highly recommend VMware
because I feel it is much more stable
and it has a a bit more fluidity when
learning operating systems now since you
are running full-fledged operating
systems in a single window your system
must have a good amount of ram free so
that it can be completely dedicated to
the operating system being run in the
sandbox environment so I would really
recommend
a VMware or virtualbox which I feel is
has become slightly dated now meanwhile
VMware Workstation player is going to be
much better
this is obviously a case of preference
and you can try out virtualbox if you
want most of the things will be similar
but once you download VMware and install
it
you should be getting a window like this
now this is the works workstation you
can get the VMware Player version which
is the free version you can get that
element as well and again most of the
things will be similar so now that we
have VMware and we have our environment
where we are going to install Linux and
work on it
let's check Kali Linux now kalinux as
you can see it's the world's most
advanced penetration testing
distribution and more importantly it is
based on Debian Debian is one of the uh
you can say the forefathers of operating
systems one of the operating systems
which paved the way for many Linux
distributions to be based on it apart
from Kali we also have another operating
system which is called parrot security
this is also uh used by ethical hackers
and cyber security analysts because this
has the uh this functions the same way
as Kali Linux as in it has all the tools
and techniques that you may require in
your ethical hacking Journey
so uh you can use either of them either
color Linux or pirate security and more
importantly for today's video actually
any Linux distribution will do because
this is more about learning the basics
and the basics will stay same
irrespective if you go for Kali parrot
Ubuntu or any other business
distribution that you can think of but
I'm just letting you know that there are
two options here where it has a bit more
features but Kali Linux is the industry
standard today and has been for like a
decade now at this point uh so it is
much recommended to go with Kali and
that's what we are going to work on
today so to download the ISO file we'll
just click the download button here
and you can see it offers a variety of
options you can directly download for
virtual machines which is see as you can
see it is the recommended but it is it
is going to deprive you of a few
um learning things so what we can do is
we will get the live boot system what
live boot will do it will provide the
ISO file which we can later use to
install on our VMware system so I will
go to the live pool
includes everything
as you can see I got a torrent file
I will place this torrent for download
now
actually instead of the torrent we can
just download the pointless live image
this actually here this version had
every tool possible but this one this uh
January Edition you can see Kali
Community 23.1 the January live version
Point release live image you can just
download this one directly just click
the download button here which is
written at 3.8 gigs the ISO file size
just click on download
and your download red star
so remember once again you can do this
process with parrot security directly as
well I think if you go to download
button here
yes we have to choose the security
Edition now they also have multiple
versions for let's say the home edition
is for daily use you know
um just casual browsing or just a
multimedia process all those things hack
the box is completely separate uh
service that functions easy to easy to
hack
boxes that will be a completely separate
Edition similar to Cloud architect and
Raspberry Pi but if you are going to use
parrot security get the security Edition
directly just download it from here and
you it you'll be good to go
but for now we are just going to install
Kal nut since that is what the majority
of Industry uses
and we'll move forward with it again
these are the containers
yes now what what would have happened if
you had chosen virtual machine is as you
can see there are many virtualization
software like VMware virtualbox and
chemo it what will provide is it will
provide a installed file it will give a
folder where the virtualbox have VMware
has already installed car Linux so you
can just load up in your VMware system
as you can see you can it will you have
to choose open a virtual machine if you
download the image directly this one so
you can just open up that folder and
your operating system will load on its
own but why after getting the iso you
can customize a lot of things the thing
about this virtual images are they're
not customizable as such with the iso I
can customize how much harder space I
want to devote to just the sandbox
operating system how much how much RAM
usage although those rhyme usage and all
can be customized everything will be
tailor made based on your specific needs
so we will check that once the download
is completed
which is just one minute remaining apart
from that you can see there is a 64-bit
I think this is 32-bit as well I'm not
sure if a third bit is required nowadays
considering everything is 64.
but yes before uh while the iso is
getting downloaded let's check out
VMware Workstation now to get started
creating a sandboxed environment we will
touch upon create a new virtual machine
yes
uh here we can let's say check on custom
because we want to customize how much we
want to give
Hardware we can use workstation 16.x
which is the latest one
now here I am going to choose I will
install the operating system later
if I give the ISO file here directly it
will install the operating system on its
own which can kind of diffuse the
purpose if that was the case we would
have downloaded the live image anyway we
I will second I will install the
operating system later
we will choose in the guest operating
system we will choose Linux and make
sure you choose dbn 10.x 64-bit as we
read in the website
it is based on eBay
it's citizen tbrn based Linux
distribution
now this can obviously change there are
other operating systems on which others
can be based like Fedora and Arch but
this one is dbn so we are going to
choose devian over here DB interning
64-bit which is the latest version
click on next we will name it as
Kali
Linux
and click on next
the number of processors I am going to
give two processors here
total processor courses for this you can
determine based on how much how powerful
your system is and how much you can give
as it is because a major part of how how
a virtual machine runs is not just how
much RAM you give to it is how much RAM
is available outside your sandbox
environment because if let's say your
system is uh has eight gigabytes of RAM
you devote four gigabytes to the virtual
machine Windows itself takes up around 4
GB uh at least 3.5 GB when it's sitting
idle so you have to account for all that
when dedicating processors and more
importantly Ram as well so we're going
to click on next for now and here what
I'm going to do is I am going to give
2.5 gigabits of ram which should be
enough for the thing at least the things
that we are doing today this can be
customized later on as well let's say
you have started working and then you
realize the amount of ram that you have
given it's just not enough and you need
a bit more then you can customize that
later for now I am going to give 2.5
gigabits of RAM
you can see the recommended is 2 gigabit
anyway I'll just go a step further click
on next
use Network address translation is the
network connection as in what kind of
networking it should have the virtual
sandbox should have considering it is
being run inside an operating system
your windows whatever internet
connection is given to your windows will
go to college nuts directly but you can
customize that let's say you don't want
networking you want host only networking
that you connect the guest operating
system to a VPN later on it's a
completely customizable process but for
easiest access we are going to use use
Network address translation
well IO controller types LSI is always
going to be the most recommended so just
go ahead with it choose a Cai for the
virtual Disk type now these are
different virtual disk types that can be
used and they have different purposes
like some make it easier to transition
between multiple uh installations of
VMware or virtualbox based on what
you've chosen but SCSI is always
considered the best disk would be we
will create a new virtual disk
now this is the maximum disk size other
disk capacity how much harder storage we
are going to devote for the operating
system installation and all the files
whatever you work in the system that
will be stored somewhere right so we're
going to devote the basically the uh
Chrome size to make it easier to
understand so I will give
30 gigabits
of memory size
now here you have another option
uh you can actually allocate all disk
space now as it is written allocating
the full capacity can enhance
performance which requires all of the
physical displays to be available right
now so the good thing about VMware is if
I think that's in virtualbox as well if
I do not click this even though I have
written 30 gigabits
he does not take up all of the 30
gigabits in your hard disks it takes how
much ever is required let's say after
installation and everything uh it takes
up 10 gigabits of space that is all that
will be taken up it won't take up all to
30 gigabits the more you keep working
and slowly the data increases the size
increases of the virtual machine a
folder it will go up to 30 gigabits
that's it
so if you allocate all of it now it will
take up the 30 gigabits directly and it
will be slightly more performance
because it will remove that read
functionality when the virtual when the
virtual machine is being run so I will
click it and between these two options
between single files and multiple files
single files is faster but multiple
files will make it easier if you want to
move your virtual machine system from
let's say one laptop to another or you
have to switch between personal and
official systems but for now I can
choose a single file
130 disk file will be created you can
just put whatever name
and I think everything else is subtle
now what we will do is we will click on
finish
it will take some time to create the
disk
I think the iso download would have been
completed yes the iso download is
completed by now
it will just take a while to create the
disk
that is also Kali net Hunter which is a
mobile penetration testing platform it
is available only on Android
you can use it to perform small tasks
obviously you can't you can't perform
everything that you can on call Linux
desktop environment but a lot of the
things can be performed like basic
Network scanning and some amount of
sniffing and uh
brute forcing tools all those things can
be performed on net Hunter directly but
that is a video for another day so we'll
just wait till the disk is created and I
will move forward with the process
as you can see the virtual machine is
now created so the next step would be to
actually align the ISO file so we're
going to click on edit virtual machine
settings here
we'll select the CD DVD
position
use ISO image file we're going to browse
go to downloads
use the Kali Linux ISO and click on OK
so now we can power on
select live system AMD 64.
at all times okay you can see a pop-up
here below that says
in this case it just shows Debian
because it is based on trivia that's it
when you're done and the operating
system boots Up Click I finish
installing so we will do that when the
time is correct
so say the live board running up
remember
okay you can see collinos is booting up
now you get the uh the usage CPU usage
meter here and this should be
the memory
yes
okay so we have entered booted into the
desktop these are the multiple
workspaces but once again this is not
installed
what we going have to do is install this
operating system
you can see you can use in the live
environment you can use everything but
you just have to
install this operating system directly
the networking system is working
okay
so once you familiarize yourself with
the Kali Linux operating system and more
importantly in the live environment you
are able to check if the amount of ram
that you have given and your processor
in general is able to sustain everything
or not you what we'll do is we will just
power off the virtual machine
and again power on and this time will
not choose the live system what we will
choose is we'll go down
we'll choose the advanced installation
options
we'll click graphical install and and
stop that's it now what this will do is
to launch the graphical installer
instead of the live system some
operating systems like parrot security
for example will allow you to install
directly from the live environment but
that's it it's not really a very big
difference if you run it from here or
there now the installation installer is
launched I'm sorry I will click the
English language yes
it will ask for your location so that it
will set your time zone I will choose
India configure the keyboard you can
choose American English considering that
is the standard keyboard layouts that is
available on the market
it will load the additional components
like the networking modules the input
output device detection drivers all
those things
some of the partitioning devices as well
I think uh it will check the network
Hardware next
configuring
configuring the network with DHCP
yes uh now that we have the uh select
the hostname the hostname I will just
keep it as Kali that's not a very big
deal this is more important if you're a
lot into networking and you want to have
you know particular home networks as a
kind of like acting as a server for the
all the devices in your home Wi-Fi
otherwise it's not an issue I can same
thing with the domain name I will skip
the domain name because it's not really
essential for what we are doing here yes
but the username will obviously be
required the full name I will give it as
simpler for example
I'll keep the same username that was the
full name this is a username
password
you can give based on your wish
make sure the passwords the same
this is the single user by the way you
can obviously create multiple users like
we do on multiple other operating
systems now it will check the disk
partitioning
here since we are installing a VMware
any virtualized software version works
for VMware we will use guided which is
use entire disk continue as you can see
we had devoted 30 GB showing 32.2
similar situation here we're going to
click on continue all files in one
partition which is recommended for new
users you have you can partition it to
home where TMP may be uh
other partitions as well that you can
keep a swap partition as well but that's
not necessary now we'll keep all of them
in a single partition let me just make
sure all the changes right it will
create the swap memory on its own and
click on continue
it will ask that these are the changes
being made just select yes
continue
and it will start installing Kali Linux
into the VMware virtual disk now this
will take some time so we will speed
this off and come back to it when the
installation is done
so now we have to set the package
manager the main partitioning system is
done and most of the installation part
is done you just have to configure the
package manager and use a network mirror
click on yes
if you do you don't need to set up
anything else here you can just click on
next and it will set up apt which is the
package manager of Kali Linux now the
package manager will do is help us
install and install
update the tools and libraries that call
Linux uses all the softwares and all the
tools that we're going to use later on
it will configure the package manager
for now
it's almost done
here we go
now it's installing the grub bootloader
which will uh when you start up the
system it will ask you where do you want
to log in
yes install the group order to my
primary drive click on continue
we'll just select Dev SDA which is you
will find a single uh Drive anyway
instead of entering Android device name
manually just click on whatever the
storage space is being uh written below
that now if you're using it on
virtualbox or VMware which you are doing
right now you will get only one storage
that's it if you're dual booting you'll
get multiple and you'll have to make
some choices but that is Advanced and we
don't need to get into that right now
for now only the last one should be
enough now it is finalizing the
installation
foreign
solution clicks that's all
and as you can see the installation is
complete so please choose continue to
reboot
we'll just press continue
now it loaded in a lot of the packages
during the live version and during the
installer so that it can continue with
the installation so it's going to remove
that live package all from the ram
and complete the process
as you can see color Linux has rebooted
and is going to the installed operating
system now
foreign
if you're a beginner into Linux you will
run into a lot of the commands being
shown just don't freak out it's all
normal
it does take some time to start up
depending on how much memory you have
given it how much I am you have devoted
to it how much even how much hardness
you have given it also depends on that
and uh obviously it also relies on how
much memory your Windows operating
system is using so that how much extra
Ram is available and how well windows
can push VMware Workstation so you have
a login screen we are going to use
whatever
username and password we had set during
installation to login
now this will be the root user you'll
understand more about that just now
let's just allow it to boot completely
foreign
so now we have called Linux operating
system installed and ready to go and
what I would recommend first thing is
just go around just check if you're new
to Linux don't make a lot of changes or
anything like that but do move around
for example if you can just click the
start button here which is termed as
applications
you can see a lot of the programs that
are installed now the good thing about
Carlos is it's very help intuitive so
for example information gathering you'll
see all the tools that you can use for
information gathering now same for
vulnerability analysis web app analysis
password attacks all the brute forcing
tools that you can use the wireless
attacks like air crack Reaver example
sniffing networks like Wireshark
Etc so just go around the operating
system C uh check the file manager how
it works and you know
basically get a feel for the operating
system directly
okay you see here's the file manager
just check another thing how it's
working you can enter the settings and
move and make some small small changes
now a lot of the settings won't matter a
lot in when running virtually but it's
good to know and understand what are the
things that Linux offers
so it's a very important step one more
thing if you are in a virtual machine is
make sure that VMware tools is installed
usually this gets installed directly but
if not you can just reinstall here okay
I think so our environment is ready and
set up
now as you might know a major part of
Linux is the command line so we're going
to click the terminal here or you can
just open right terminal has opened
so this is basically the
command line that you can use in a Mac
OS or windows so a lot of the things
that we do on wind on Linux is in the
command line itself now you can use
General graphical tools like uh let's
say the file manager for example you can
do use graphical tools you can use other
networking tools as well but it's
something it's always better to use the
terminal because one you can reach
things faster compared to a graphical
tools considering you just have to write
a single command and that's it for most
of the tools other than having to
navigate through a lot of menus and
sections and other compartments that you
have to do on a graphical interface so
we will have to focus more on this
command line terminal and the first
thing that we have to learn in a command
line terminal is the sudo user or the
root user we had discussed uh when
creating the user but I told that that
will be the root user considering we are
only adding just one user for now
okay so let's break that apart actually
uh Sudo is the keyword that we are
looking for okay now the super user or
the root user administrator of the
system is going to be someone who has
the uh all of the access to access
everything all the sensitive files all
the sensitive settings all those things
now if you can just see uh let's say if
I want to open a file
I'm going to uh put cat
Etc
shadow
it's a permission denied cat is the way
to open up text files by the way now
this file does exist but I cannot open
it because the permission is denied I am
not the root user right now I'm just
simply on Android Kali now the terminal
does not go into root mode by default
because it does it's not it's not safe
from a security perspective so we have
to check on what are the things that can
be done securely
that's why what we will do is we will
write down now sudo
let's say it uh suro is the command for
an invoking the root user we will write
the same command which is
shadow
it will ask you for your root password
that we set before
we'll just put the same password and as
you can see
it showed the details of the Shadow
password a shadow file
so why uh so that's the reason actually
why it's not recommended to have the
root user at all times it's all uh it's
not recommended meanwhile what you can
do is let's say you work a lot with the
pseudo password for example a lot of the
things that we're going to do in this
video will require the sudo keyword
which is the root access now if you just
open a new tab for example
you'll get another terminal without any
issues now one thing I want to note out
is if you are learning a lot of the
tools use that require the sudo command
like opening sensitive files like this
one HC Shadow or making small small
changes that require root access like
changing the network adapter checking
what kind of uh what kind of external
devices are being connected from a
system perspective although since you
will require to run continuously so
instead of writing sudo again and again
and again for every command what you can
use this command sudo Su now what this
will do is it will change the terminal
and change the user in this particular
terminal tab to a root user now I will
just press enter and you can see you can
check this dollar sign here
once I press on sudo SEO this will
change to a hash and you can see the
user has changed now from the simply
learn to the root user which basically
has all the permissions to do whatever
it can with the system it can change
into hash so now whatever you have to do
you don't have to write sudo command
anymore and just write candidate Shadow
and there you go now remember this uh
root user terminal is only valid for
this particular tab not even this window
this particular tab if I go to this tab
here or I'll just close it and create a
new tab
Etc dollar and where you in the simply
learn user anyway you can't log in
directly to the root usage for security
purposes like let's say if while it is
ultra rare for Linux to have any kind of
malware it is always better to not give
it all the permissions like you can have
in some other print system like Windows
so you have to dial into root directly
okay so you can use sudo command uh you
don't have to use to recommend if you
have the sudo SU
a lot of the things uh sometimes you'll
find commands that will not work like
the cat TC Shadow they will not work or
sometimes the commands will work but
they won't work all the way you'll find
something is wrong so always make it a
point to try it with sudo once before
moving forward
so now let's understand how we can
navigate the file system in Linux so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
open the terminal again just increase
the size of the texture value
so as you can see uh this still symbol
this means we're at the firm location to
understand how we can determine which
directory we are in currently we always
remember terminal will open in a
particular directory that's the entire
point of the terminal or the command
line for example to find out what you
are in right now you can just type in
the command PWD which stands for present
working directory click enter and you
can see I'm at the home folder in this
simpler now this can obviously change
for example if I want to move somewhere
else now I'll just open the file manager
and show you once
this is the home simply run folder as
you can see it is written here Tona is
the name of the file manager this is the
home folder now you have desktop
documents downloads music all these
folders subfolders you can say inside
the simpler folder home folder so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to move to
let's say the documents folder okay so
the command for that would be CD which
is change directory so I'm going to
write as you can see it'll automatically
try to complete the more you use color
Linux and actually most of the Linux
operating systems the shell or The
Terminal understands where you go and
what you do all those things so that way
I will going to change the directory to
the let's say the documents folder now
we're going to just write CD documents
and as you can see there is an extra
word here the documents which means that
now you are in the documents we can use
bwd command again to check and you can
see home simpler documents now what if
you're at a position where you don't
know where uh you are and what are the
files that are present there for example
I just opened this in the graphical user
interface and founder that okay these
are the subfolders that I can get into
to understand what are the folders
available at your particular location
the command is just listing for command
is LS press enter okay this is the
documents apologies we'll just to go
back one step right now we are in home
simply learn documents to go back a
single step will just write CD double
dot double full stop then you can see
once again we are back to home simply
learn now once again to understand what
are the folders that are present we have
to use the command LS and as you can see
you can see everything that is present
the desktop document downloads music
which is all those folders can pop up
now you can move here and there based on
where you want to go
apart from this let's say if you want to
create a new folder for your own one
thing we can do is mkdir that command
stands for make directory now if I want
to create a new folder by the name of
mkdir SLP now remember make sure you
understand which position we are at
which is right now home simply learn
based on the last PWD I haven't used CD
command anything after that so now if I
press LS you can see another folder in
the name of SLP now you can do the same
things you can just go to SLP you can
see the path has now changed to home
simple learn SLP you can go back and
that's how you can work and create
folders to delete let's say I don't want
to have the SLP folder anymore I'll just
use rmdir SLP
now if I check LS we don't have that
folder anymore so that's how you work in
between folders
now one more thing that you can do is
just clear and it will clear up the
terminal for you now just to check where
we are again home simply learn now
remember seeing the cat folder right uh
the cat for uh sorry the cat command
using the ETC folder and the shadow file
now let's say if I want to see what is
inside the ETC file for example if I
just put down LS it will only show me
what the the folders present in my
present working directory what I can do
is I can just write LS
Etc
and these are the folders that are
present in the ETC folder so you can
check other files listings here as well
and directly giving the full path so
that will ignore the current working
director the present working directory
and show the folders present in the path
that you mentioned
okay apart from that one more thing that
we need to know when it comes to listing
our details is the LA command now
all of these commands is LS PWD at least
90 of the commands that you're going to
use in the Linux terminal I just clear
this for now 90 of the commands that you
use in Linux will have sub commands or
uh it is also called as flags that go
along with it now for example in my
current present working directly if I
press on LS
I get these folders right but these are
not the only folders that are presented
these are the only folders that are
being shown now to see the other files
and folders that are present in the home
folder I can write the normal command Ls
I'm going to add a sub command or a flag
if you say hyphen la
and you can see there are much more than
the desktop documents downloads that's
something that we were already seeing
here but apart from that you can see
other files and folders here the dot
cache Dot config.logout
everything you can see now everything
that has a DOT or full stop uh before it
is considered a hidden file it's not
going to show up directly using LS you
have to write the LA command which will
show all the files now it's very
important to understand these sub
commands and what are the flags that can
be used in different purposes yeah this
is basically the shell so the more
research you do and understand what kind
of flags that you can use it's going to
be easier
what can help here is the man command
the man basically stands for manual you
can find it in every Linux actually
let's say you want to learn what are the
flags that you can use with the ls
command for example or you just want to
know what that command is so you can
just type in man LS
and you see basically says L stands for
list directory contents is a description
here you can see all this sub commands
the flags minus B minus D there's a good
explanation for every single sub command
that you can use in order to navigate to
the file system or just listing this is
just for LS command you can do this with
almost any command that you want
it says once you are once you've read
what you needed to know just press Q to
quit
and there you have it so that's all
about how to list commands are list
folders and navigate through file
systems using CD mkdir and rfdir
now about the commands that you saw and
all the folders that you were able to
see let's say if I just press LS la
you can see there is a folder called
dot cache right so to enter the file you
also need to just use the Siri comma you
can see the present working director has
changed you can just press press lscr
and see if anything else yes you can see
there are other folders here as well so
the entire process Remains the Same but
just understand that if there are some
files and folders that you're not able
to see which is going to happen a lot
considering a lot of the things that are
hidden in Linux by default you can
access all of those things but you need
to know the right commands and the right
way to access them so if you are missing
out on some files and folders just make
sure you can uh you're using the ls
command and sometimes say when the LA
command to get the details of everything
that you are missing now this folder
currently doesn't have as such any a lot
of missing files and folders like the
home folder had so right now it's not
very indicative but you get the full
idea of it another thing that you can
use apart from the let's say the man
command is the hell command help hyphen
hyphen help
this is a small this is not as detailed
as man and this doesn't work for all
commands but you can do a lot of the
commands I if you need a quick answer to
something you can definitely check this
out which is the hyphen hyphen help
so why we are clear about folders like
how to manipulate folders let's take a
look about how we're going to work with
files for example now let's say uh if
you use the echo command Echo command is
the equivalent of trying to put
something on screen so let's say if I
just press Echo with the codes it just
print out hello if I want to put it
inside a file I'll just say
yeah
just press Ctrl 0 I'll just pray Echo
hello to autocomplete just press the
right arrow on your keyboard it will
order complete uh after that Echo hello
I want to put this into a file let's say
uh my file
Dot txt
yes uh we'll do one thing this is
currently in the cache folder right
we'll just go back
yes this is the home folder so we're
going to do the same thing here now to
go back to our history of comments I
want to do the same thing I want to Echo
hello into our new file so I'll just
press the up Arrow and it will go cycle
through my recent commands so I'll just
press enter
and if I just press SLS now you can see
the home folder there's a new file of
MiFi dot text okay if I want to let's
say move this file to one of these
folders let's say I want to move this to
the video folders so the command for
that is c p which is copy I will copy
the my file
dot text to the videos folder
so I'll just enter I don't need to
actually enter videos to see the files
like we had discussed so what we're
going to do is I'm going to just type in
LS videos
and you can see it has the my file.x
folder since I copied it obviously the
home folder will also have the my file
text in order to remove the my file text
I have to use the RM command then we
want to move directories we used rmdir
to remove files we just have to use RM
so I'm going to use RM my file.txt to
delete the file now if I LS the home
folder does not have but since it had in
the I had copied uh kept a copying the
videos folder I'll press LS videos
press enter and you can see it still has
the my file command
okay now one more thing that we can need
to know is the
move command
remove command will essentially move
whatever folder wherever you want let's
say I want to create Ico hello my file
again I'll press LS and I'll see the
myfile.txt folder now if I want to move
this file let's say
if I use the MV command instead of the
CP command which is just for a I want to
use the my file.txt to let's say the
downloads folder
it's saying permission denied so what I
will do is I will click on sudo like we
discussed a lot of the things will not
work directly
we will use the same command
we'll use the downloads folder
until now work
it's time to take a look at users and
privileges now if you remember our LS
command
uh let's just check my present working
directory it's the home folder now if
you remember the r minus L A you see a
lot of the
characters here which is the rwxr all
those things now this is basically to
understand what folder or what
permissions a user has if you check here
there are folders and files you can see
the folders in the dark blue color and
the files in the white color you can see
Light Blue for links whether it's a
completely separate uh thing so another
thing the permissions part if you see
there are three groups here
this is a first group this is the second
group this is the third group the first
group is the owner of the file now what
permissions does the owner have now for
example right now the owner of let's say
this one uh this way for example is root
most of the time it will be the user but
this time it is root it has a read write
execute R for read W for right and X for
execute obviously the owner will be able
to do all those things now the second
group is basically for anyone who is
part of the
domain group in the users like if you
remember while installing that it was a
option called Creator domain why we did
not create it because we don't have a
lot of users right now but when you
create a domain what are the people in
the group who are going to do so they
have the read function which is the RX
for execute but they do not have the
right function they cannot write
directly in this file
similarly for the third Group which is
anyone outside of the group so any other
user if they are not in a particular
group of the file then they also have
the read function and the execute
function but they will not be able to
write into the file directly so that's
how you can check all of the files that
are able to that a user can access or
not access
that's basically the entire purpose of
the uh the privilege section because we
don't want to give undue permission to a
people who do not require it the entire
point of security in Linux is to be is a
level of abstraction that is providing
users with exactly what they are needed
so if you have a user that does not
require executable functions to let's
say the downloads folder we can cut it
off from r as a root user anyway
so that's about providing Privileges and
providing access to certain files
like we had discussed the ETC Shadow
file that we had are used when checking
the cad file now one more thing that we
can do again is understanding what the
shadow file does if you just press cat e
to C Shadow obviously it will not work
it will just say permission to deny
we're going to say sudo cat shadow
this basically has the password hashes
for all the users that are in a system
right now you can see the root head does
not have a hash because it's not safe to
have a particular hash for a user just
from security perspective uh we the the
user that we have created which is
simply learn you can see the password
hash being mentioned here now depends on
how many users you get if you create
three four five users you can see all
the password hashes here now you can so
if if the why this is password protected
by security and we need to use the sudo
user command is because if someone has
this hash let's say if someone is a
cryptographer and is able to Brute Force
through hashes then it's very it's going
to be very easy to try and figure out
the passwords to particular users
passwords that's why even the hash is
not shown with uh full confidence unless
and until they get the pseudo user
command
so that's about uh you know Privileges
and how you can use the Surah command to
bypass the normal user limits so now
let's take a look at some of the
networking commands we're going to clear
this one for now
uh check the adapters that we have in
use right now
you can just write if config or actually
IPA uh sorry I'm not c i p a
similar information IPA is a newer
variant it basically shows what other
adapters and the networking conditions
right now for example you can see
ethernet now even though I am using
Wi-Fi on my local system
uh in network address translation which
is the NAT that we set the network
package manager when setting up the
virtual machine virtual machine on this
VMware it will link up as ethernet so
you can see ethernet you can check our
local address you can check our credit
for subnet
this is our broadcast address and this
is our Mac address for the system this
is the IPv6 address as well now
similarly
uh this can be checked on whichever
system you are being connected to the
IPA ifconfig is the same it's just uh an
older variant apart from this there is
another command actually I W config now
this is particularly for wireless oh
sorry that was a wrong spelling I have i
w config now right now it will not show
any Wireless extensions if you are
looking into Wireless sniffing uh the
network package detection or even
Wireless hacking for example we will
publish a video on wireless hacking soon
so stay tuned for that apart from apart
from Wireless hacking if you are using
any Wireless extensions let's say we
have small adapters that people can use
as Portables or wireless cards for Wi-Fi
for some systems they do not have Wi-Fi
enabled and ICS in their motherboards
the people use modifiable custom uh
portable
adapters so if you have one of those
plugged in you will see it in Idaho
config from ifconfig you will only may
be able to find out the IP address and
that's it iwconfig will give you all the
information and you can check later
coming to different IP addresses are
command that you should be knowing is
arp
now if you are not familiar with ARP
that is going to be address resolution
protocol I think ipn will also show the
same information so what both of these
do is it basically states which IP
address relates to what Mac address it
will also show which one is reachable
which one is stable all those extra now
remember whatever is being done in these
kind of uh IP addresses and Mac
addresses all of them need to be put in
a routing table if you want to connect
with each other now how you can check
that just enter out and you can see the
routing table for this particular system
you can see there is a destination for
every IP address there's an open Gateway
there is a mask here
all of this stuff whatever database they
needs to travel in between host now the
second host let's say from this virtual
machine I want to travel I I want the to
communicate with a system that is in my
similar voice in the same Wi-Fi network
then there must be a routing table
connection between them this can uh the
example that I gave the same Wi-Fi
network thing that will mostly be handed
by the modem or the router basically but
what if it's not what if there's just
two systems and they're not having any
other correction and it just had to
happen to have a uh align cable
connected between them you have to set
these routing tables manually so that
you are able to communicate this is
going to be expressly useful if you're
setting up in a domain group authorities
and all those things but apart from that
it's just a good thing to know how
networking works now all of these
commands this Mac addresses these IP
addresses these are something that are
of utmost importance so in learning
networking when learning Linux is very
essential I highly suggest learn
networking so that you can be able to
grasp these things better now based on
how we can communicate with particular
host addresses there is a command if you
want to check if you can reach a
particular host or not that is using the
pink command now we'll take a common
example for this because I don't have
any other system in the uh
Network right now so let's say if I want
to go let's I want to see if I have
connection to google.com now you can use
directly an IP address as well I'm just
going to check ping google.com
and you can see it will start pinging
request directly from the google.com
server whichever is the nearest server
that Google has
set
you can see it just says that it did
it's N64 bytes from this particular IP
address it received an icmp request was
sent
the time it took for each request is
also mentioned at the end here 15 Ms 16
Ms 17 18 all the SMS now since we are
getting a particular request back ICB
basically require uh needs a response if
we are getting a response then that host
is reachable if I did not have internet
right now this would not be possible
I'll just show I'll press Ctrl C
whatever whatever command is being run
if you want to stop it on the next
terminal it is best to uh it is Ctrl C
okay just press Ctrl C I will it will
give a small report here as well it says
51 package transmitted 50 receive how
much packet loss was there if some of
the requests did not go through or did
not receive a response how much time it
was taken all those things I'm going to
clear and what I'm going to do
I'm going to disconnect
yes the network connection has been
disconnected now if I put ping.google
sorry ping dot google.com
temporary failure in nameless solution
as simple as that so once I connect
again
that sounded pretty straightforward
apart from using uh domain names you can
also use IP addresses like we mentioned
now another IP address that we can ping
for sure since we have internet
connection is cloudflare's DNS
resolution address now that would be
ping
1.1.1.1 now you better to have to
understand DNS it's basically acts as an
address book for all the websites that
you see
in whichever way it may be for example
if let's say we're reaching google.com
when we print google.com we saw this IP
address responding request we didn't saw
google.com particularly responding to
requests right these IP address will
depend based on what uh what DNA
Services Google has and what how many
servers they have in particular
locations that's why
uh hitting IP address directly also work
that's why DNS is essential so we're
going to bring 1.1.1.1
and you can see we're getting response
times for those as well now these will
be generally faster compared to normal
low websites
as you can see the time is much less
compared to pinging google.com Okay uh
obviously if you can't Target something
let's say one point one point two point
five for example
I'm not sure if that is even a host
100 practical loss it's just uh
nothing worked
it will not work it won't send anything
even if there is a host let's say if I
have an IP address of a system that is
in my group but it does not have
permission to receive IPP request or it
has just closed off all the ports that
we cannot connect with it then it will
just not work it will just say it's not
existing
you see we sent 26 packets none of them
were received and there's a 100 bracket
loss
that's why I'll just check once what is
the IP address of our system Plus
192.168 72.130
if I
192 168
700 2.0 130 I'll just play 154 or
something
there is no host there was another
address there it would have received
some request and since there is no host
it says destination host unreachable
that's how you can check if you have
connectivity with the particle Sir with
a particular system in your network or
your group or your domain using the
thing command so that's the networking
command that all the networking commands
that you need to know for now the basics
at the very least
the next thing you have to take a look
at is services
the services will differ wildly based on
the system that you are using for
example on Windows you see services for
different stuff like for any remote
desktop software you check and you see
services
similar cases with Linux if I just open
let's say h top
okay let's you know we have to install
it stop let's just stop here it
basically functions the top functions as
a task manager you can see so many
systems Services here like song tonar
access top is running on the background
stuff like that now if I want to start
something particular let's take the
Apache web server now Apache web servers
have been in use for like the years
decades at this point so in order to
function uh see how Apache server is
used the first thing I am going to check
is my
IP address this is my IP address
so what I'll do is I will copy this I'll
open my web browser Apache web servers
are hosted on your own IP so I'll just
paste it here and click enter
and you can see there's nothing popping
up now a major reason can this hobby for
this can be the server is not running so
one thing what we'll do is we're going
to start the Apache server by starting
its service so we're going to use system
start so sorry system Apache to start
never click enter
it will say it just not work what I will
do is uh sorry this correct term was
service not system and even if I click
on service
Apache to start
it will say it needs authentication now
this could bypass by directly giving
sudo and putting in the root password in
the command line itself but all in all
it's the same result so I'll just use my
password Here and now I just remove the
HTTP here because Apache is a local
server
now you can see the Apache web server
has loaded based on Apache between
different the remain default please now
as you can see
the server is working correctly
if I just open the terminal again now to
stop it I can once again just go so row
service Apache to stop this will stop
the service I'll just press enter
I'll refresh and there will user access
a very good part of our purchase servers
used to be the ability to hold files
ability to host files basically for
people in the same domain or even the
same network
okay now you can see where the files can
be stored like for example it says you
should replace this file located at
where HTML
index.html so if I just open up a file
explorer
go to file system
where
www.html this is where a lot of people
can post their files okay now another
better way is to hold up python server
now considering all of Linux come almost
every single Linux distribution now
comes with python pre-installed so how
we can do that is
I'll let that keep running we don't have
an issue
register
no actually let's stop that it will be
easier to understand how it's working
if you're refresh now as you can see
nothing is working so what we're going
to do is we're going to start
a python HTTP server
python is used to python minus m is the
sub flag for it and HTTP server we're
going to start now what is my present
working directory
simpler let me just clear these present
work directory is the home folder if you
check what are the folders are available
desktop documents dollars these are the
folders now if I am running the HTTP
server on this folder even though it
will only my IP is going to be used for
accessing the server it depends on which
folder I'm hosting it from so if I host
the python HTTP server
wait uh python HTTP server from this
folder I just press enter and you can
say it says serving HTTP on 0.0 is
basically your local IP address
and I'm using the port 80 you can use
whichever that's not really important
which port to use file refresh now you
can see I see all the folders that are
available documents downloads these dot
are something other things that we've
already seen using the minus l a comma
so all the files are now hosted properly
as expected similarly
if we want to use let's say any other
files that we want to share with someone
in a network uh easily and this can very
well function like an FTP server this is
not exactly FTP server but this can be
easily accessed with just the URL
someone is in my system and somebody
said my home network for example they
can just use my IP address which will be
192.16870 to 130 they can check the Ping
command and see if it is reachable which
it should be unless until some
particular Port is closed they can just
access the files using this one now to
stop the python HTTP server once again
just press Ctrl C
and
so on so that's how you work with
services in college index at least from
a basic perspective that's how it's
going to work
and one of the last things that we're
going to check is the ability to install
update tools and basically all the
software that you can see here you see
all the applications
that can be run for example the
vulnerability analysis tools nmap SQL
map River
pixie WPS all those things now how do
these get installed updated and
basically dealt with so PT actually apt
get also but uh those are
interchangeable and you can use
whichever one you like I use apt get
but in order to check let's say if you
want to update a system which is one of
the bare minimum needs of every system
right so the command for that is going
to be so uh first thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to use sudo Su which is the
sudo super user I will just use sudo SU
and go into the root stage because
almost all of the commands that I'm
going to put next require sudo so I
might as well just be without having to
type the password every single time now
once I'm sure I use you the correct
command would be apt get
update now what this will do is it will
check the repositories every Linux
distribution has a few repositories that
it gets the softwares and updates from
it will check the package lists now for
now the repository that is being hit is
the correct or download Kali rolling in
release right so it will update the
repositories based on the data available
on that particular address we use the
APD get update Commander so next thing
what we are going to do is apt get
upgrade
yes so now after the repositories have
been updated with the data available on
the web server it says that the
following packages will be upgraded you
can see the Apache 2 server needs an
update then you have CS certificate
script setup Firefox ESR which is a
Firefox browser for extended support
release Linux platforms all those things
the Misa Vulcan drivers python python
flask all those things out of total 303
upgraded no new installations are needed
and four need not be upgraded so after
this operation you'll see 364 MB of
files needs to be downloaded and 24 MBA
additional displays will be used you can
either continue using y or n so let's
say you're going to update your system
now if I just even if I click n and be
done with that this is all about
updating I'm going to clear this out but
how do we install files for example if
you remember I typed out a command
called H top it says command stop not
found but can be installed with apt
install H top that can once again be apt
get as well it's not a very big deal
which one do you use I just cancel this
and I will write out the command myself
I will use let's use apt for this one
instead of APD cat APD install at shop
now I am able to do this very easily
because it stop is already in the
repository I have uh that in the Kali
enrolling release repository that's why
as you can see the installation has been
started this is the the fetched 152 KB
which is the size of edge shop it's a
very small thing and the installation is
now complete now if I just sit on edge
top
you can see a newer version of the
without
the task manager or the system monitor
essentially to see what now where the
memory is being usage the CPU percentage
all those things so that's how you can
install if I press Ctrl C again I'll go
back to my command line interface so
that's how you can install
either to remove
you can just use apt remove HTTP it says
want to remove and 387 kilobyte disk
will be freed if I just press enter we
don't have a stop anymore so that's how
you install and remove tools from Kali
Linux using the APT and APD CAD now
these apt and APK are package managers
specifically for Debian and Debian based
operating systems that's why these
commands will transition will be
consistent across all dbm based
Distribution Systems unless and until
they have their own package manager
which is not really the case if they are
based on DBL so similarly if a dollar
has enf Arch has Batman all those things
so those will differ but if in a
particular
um in a particular base distribution
these package managers will be the same
so that's how you can use apt and EPT
get to understand how you can install
and remove tools I think we've covered
everything that we've set the agenda for
in this color Linux tutorial and
basically a Linux crash course now these
are all the basics of Linux and there
are so much more to learn if you have
any requirements like if you want to
learn about something maybe more about
file systems or more about
users and privileges or just you need
something specific let's say you want to
hack uh if you want to learn privileges
escalation or if you want to learn how
to hack wireless networks please let us
know in the comments below we will
definitely get back to you with that
thank you so much for watching and keep
learning
