description box and pin comments so
let's get started so as a mentioned
portfolio is basically a file that
contains a collection of your best Works
to be presented to your employer or
client so make sure you don't stuff your
portfolio with all the work that you
have done only keep the ones that you
consider your best work which you're
confident about and where you have
portrayed your strengths now you have to
present your projects in the form of
case studies so case studies basically a
summarized explanation of your project
where you will mention the goals
objectives the research methods you have
used how you found the solution and
finally the result so to choose the case
study again make sure you choose the
best ones you can keep it simple by
adding just three to four case studies
now try to keep it in a chronological
order basically the first case study
that you present must be your best and
if you have worked on some real life
projects or collaborated on some
projects you can add those as your first
case study and the rest can be your
personal projects so I would suggest you
to visit the Coolio's website from where
you will get some ideas and take
Inspirations for your portfolio so this
is the Coolio website where you can
login with your email account so
basically cor folios contains the
portfolios of interns from Big tech
companies so here you can find for
example you know this person he's
working on Instagram so you can
basically visit his portfolio take his
case study and you can take inspiration
because you know as you can see the
structure what he has used so you can
take Inspirations from these interns to
develop your own portfolio Okay so by
now you learned what portfolio is and
what are the key points to keep in mind
while selecting your projects and how to
create a case study now how do you
present these so firstly you need to
build a mockup for your project so
mockups are basically a screenshot of
how your product looks like so going by
its definition it is a visual
representation or blueprint of a digital
product typically created to Showcase
its layout structure and visual elements
it designers and stakeholders Envision
how the final product will look and
function before it's fully developed so
right now I will give you an idea on how
you can use figma to build your mockups
Yeah so basically what you can do is in
figma there are many free mockup
templates okay if you just search uh
free mockup templates in figma you'll
receive a number of you know templates
so right now I have chosen this template
so you might have created a prototype
you know a VF frame and a prototype so
this was a prot prototype that I
actually created in the previous video
you can check out that video to know how
to create a prototype so this is
basically a clothing app in which I have
designed two pages so what you can do is
here you have two options so this is the
mockup template here you have two
options the template option and the
screen option so you can go to the
screen option where you can find frames
so make sure you know basically what you
have to do is you have to copy this
particular page or frame and paste it in
this Frame so make sure that the
resolution of both are the same like for
example the resolution the width and
height of this particular frame of the
template is 450 and 974 so try to
maintain the same resolution okay so
basically what we do is we'll copy this
Frame we'll paste it over here so this
is my first page now you'll copy the
second page and paste it in the second
frame yeah so now you have to take the
template option where you can actually
you know view your templates so this is
how your templates are arranged now
there are so many options like single
screen template double screen triple
screen so right now I just have two
pages for my app so I can go to double
screen template so if you zoom so these
are the templates okay so now basically
for creating so see these mockups are
like basically screenshot so what you
will do is you will actually you know
place these mockups in your website in
the portfolio website so what you can do
is you can you have to download this
particular mockup first so select a
mockup design like for example I
selected this design you can go to
theile file section and Export
it it will get downloaded in the PNG
format see now it got downloaded in the
PNG format now having made the markup
let's move on to how to structure your
portfolio see you have the freedom to
structure it in your own way you can
also refer to C folios as mentioned
earlier now I will just give you a basic
structural idea so you can start your
portfolio with an introduction section
where you introduce yourself keep it
simple short and relevant now try to
make your portfolio with a good
storytelling you can start by the name
of your project after which you provide
a short description of your project then
Define the objectives of your project
also include what your responsibilities
were in the project now explain the
problem statement here you have to
explain your problem statement from
where you identify the problem and your
inspiration to solve this problem after
that explain how you approach the
problem and what research activities did
you perform explain the insights you
gain from the research and your course
of action or plan and finally explain
the solution which is the design you
came up with so hope you got an idea on
how to structure your portfolio now
where do you make these portfolios and
which platforms to use so basically you
portray your portfolio in a website
format so there are two ways either you
can build your website if you know how
to build one but we recommend you to use
web Builder platform so that you can
save your time and concentrate more on
your designs so there are many web
Builder platforms such as Odo
Squarespace behance notion Etc so today
I'll be just showing a demo on how to
create a basic demo on how to create a
portfolio website on Squarespace yeah so
this is this will be your Squarespace
page so you have to you know sign up
using your Gmail account or any email ID
and first you'll get a number of
questions which asks your interests
either you can select those or skip
those options and finally this will be
the page that you land in so you can
select portfolio option and in that you
can select photography option so you
will get so many templates from which
you can select any of your choice so
basically you just need a basic idea
because you know mostly we'll be
deleting the other sections and creating
it on our own so yeah I will select this
particular design we'll give start with
this design just a second it's taking a
bit time yeah so here they will ask you
what site title do you want okay so I'm
just giving my name because it's my
portfolio I'm just giving my
name yeah just give next next get
started yeah so here's your template a
basic template now what you can do is
you can edit this you can go to the edit
section yeah so now you came here you
can edit the side header so this is the
header this is the body and this is the
footer so right now we are editing the
header you can actually add elements see
for here right now we have work inquired
and about so if you want you can add
elements like if you want to add your
social media links you can just you know
press this button where you can actually
add a social media link like Let It Be
Instagram Facebook or anything of your
choice so this is how you can add
elements or you can delete elements in a
header now we'll go to the body we'll
create our own body so that we'll remove
all these sections
now remove yeah so now you have the
header and the footer will come to the
footer later so now you can add a
section add section you have to press
add a blank
section so once you have added the
section you have to add a block so
basically now we are going to you know
play our mockups so we already
downloaded the mockup screenshot we
which we made in figma so now we add the
block choose image upload file go to
downloads just a
second yeah so now this got uploaded now
you can also add a description or a text
so that again you can add a block go to
text you can place this uh just a second
yeah you can place this text below and
for example I'm just adding X YZ
collections because that's my app's name
now you can change the font you know the
style of your text you can Center align
it yeah so you can change everything
also if you want you can add a
description below like what your app is
all about okay so this is how basically
you add a Blog now I had also created a
mockup for a website
upload
file so this is basically how you add
your mockups in an image format okay and
again you can give a description about
how I give it here so this is how you
can actually you know design the body of
your websites page you can use your own
creativity I've just given you a basic
idea on how to use the options so our
header is done our body is done so now
we'll come to the footer we'll edit the
footer basically we don't want this you
know what we'll remove the whole footer
section
itself yes now we'll add a footer now
there are so many templates that you can
use right so let me just go
through yes so I'll use this okay there
is an about section contact Section
follow section social media section also
if you want to even here you can add a
text or an
image yeah so here I have added a text
maybe I can just paste
this yeah so this is the basics how you
create a website a portfolio website
using a website buildup so yeah we have
come to the end of this video hope you
