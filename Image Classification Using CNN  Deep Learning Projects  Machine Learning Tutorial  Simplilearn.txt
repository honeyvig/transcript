today we will take you through our hands
of lab demo of how to do image
classification using CNN before we start
I hope this screen is clearly visible
and the audio is fine if yes please type
in yes if there are any issues do let us
know in the chat section so that we can
resolve them
let's wait for some more minutes to let
other people join until then let me tell
you guys that we have regular updates on
multiple Technologies if you are a tech
geek in a continuous hunt for the latest
technological Trends then consider

great I think we can get started so in
today's session we will discuss what
image classification is and moving ahead
we will discuss what CNN is and at the
end we will do a hands of lab demo of
image classification using CNN
so before we move on to the programming
part let's discuss what image
classification is and proceed further
for the same what is image
classification
the process of classifying an entire
image is known as image classification
images are anticipated to have just one
class per image models for image
classification taken an image as input
and produce a prediction of the class to
which the image belongs
so we can utilize image classification
models when we are not interested in
individual instance of items with
position information or their shape
so let's see what is CNN
machine learning includes convolutional
neural networks also known as convents
or cnns it is a subset of the several
artificial neural network models that
are employed for diverse purpose and
data sets a CNN is a particular type of
network design but deep learning
algorithm that is utilized for tasks
like image recognition and pixel data
processing and so more
okay
although there are different kinds of
neural network in deep learning
cnns are preferred neural architect for
identifying and recognizing object
therefore they are really suited for
computer vision activities and
application where accurate object
recognition is crucial
such as facial and self-driving automile
system so moving ahead
so dear Learners if you want to upskill
your AI and machine learning skills so
give yourself a chance to Simply and
professions certificate program in Ai
and machine learning which comes with
the completion certificate and in-depth
knowledge of AI and machine learning
check this course out details from the
description box below so now let's move
to our programming part of how to do
image classification using CNN if
getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scale up by simply learn
click on the link in the description to
know more
we will open a command prompt to write a
command to open Jupiter notebook so here
we will write Jupiter
notebook
press enter
so this is the landing page of Jupiter
notebook so here you can select new
python file
so this is how the kernels look like
okay jupyter notebook colors look like
so first we will import some major
libraries of python which will help us
in like analyzing the data okay so in
this file we will classify small images
of cifar 10 data set from tensorflow
Keras data set there are total 10
classes as shown below so we will use
CNN for the classification purpose okay
so here I will write import
sensorflow
as TF
okay so from
tensorflow
dot Keras
import
data sets
from our layers
of models
okay
so we will import
numpy as NP
right
and import
matplotlib
as
PLT
right okay so here I will let pipelot
as PLT
right so tensorflow this one
this
so tensorflow is a free and open source
machine learning and artificial
intelligence software Library
it can be used for variety of
applications
but it focuses on mainly deep neural
network training and the influence
purpose okay got it
and this numpy numpa is a python Library
used for working with arrays it also has
a function for working with the domain
of lineal algebra and matrices it is an
open source project and you can use it
freely number stand for numerical python
and this third one matplotlib
for Python and its numerical extension
numpy matplotlib is a cross-platform
data visualization and graphical
charting package as a result it presents
a strong open source substitute for
Matlab the apis application programming
interfaces for matplotlib allow
programmers to incorporate graphs into
GUI applications
got it
so let's run this
let's let me change image
classification
using
Vienna
okay
so let's load the data set okay we will
load the data set from the uh
load data function
so here I will write
X
underscore
train
comma y underscore tree
okay
and one for test X
underscore test comma y underscore test
okay then equals to data set
result sets dot we are using Cipher 10.
C for 10
for 10
dot load
Dot
underscore
data okay
so it will load our data so let's load
the data
so data is loaded let's see X
score
test dot shape
okay
yeah
so as you can see
so we have thousand
rows and what what x
underscore train
dot shape
let me run this
so here you can see
like we see like training data
like training images are 50 000 and the
test images are
ten thousand okay
so this is for testing this is for
training and
so moving ahead we will see for the Y
train
dot shape
thousand and here we will see the array
so y underscore train
five
okay let's send this first let me give
some space yeah
so here why underscore train is a 2d
array like for our classification having
1D arrays are good enough
so what we will do we will convert this
to now 1D array this is 2D array we will
convert into 1D array okay for that
we'll write here y underscore train
was to Y underscore train
dot reshape
minus 1 comma
okay then y underscore train
and again semicolon 5.
let's run this
okay so now this is 1D array
so
y underscore test
equals to Y underscore test
Dot
reshape
in -1
here I will write
classes
question there are some classes okay in
the data set like airplane
comma
automobile
comma
but
comma
cat
comma
yeah
dog
dog
Foods
step
the truck
okay
so these are the some classes
like airplane automobile bird cat deer
so it will be helping classifying the
images
so let's plot some images to see like
what they are what they exactly are okay
so we will what we will do we will
create one function
for that
let me write here
def plot underscore sample
okay then X comma y
comma index
okay
then I will write here plot dot figure
PLT dot figure
then figure size should be
comma 2
equals to
pld dot show
image show to IM show
X
index
PLT
dot X label
classes
y index okay
so let's see some samples of the images
so I will write a plot
underscore sample
uh let's go train
comma y underscore train
okay comma let's see the fifth image
okay then enter
it would be capital
so as you can see this is a car so it is
showing automobile okay
so let's see once more
like plot underscore sample
X underscore train
comma y underscore test
comma we'll see the tenth one
okay it is not quite visible
so we'll go for the 11.
okay okay I am
white is showing wrong because I use a
test I have to use here train instead of
test
then it will show I think correct yeah
you can see horse the nodes
then what about
201 image
see you can see
so we will see once more
500
Fancy Frog okay it's not quite visible
yeah so you can see here
the proper ship okay
so what we will do now we will normalize
the images to a number from 0 to 1
image has three channels like RGB colors
so and each value in the channel can
range from 0 to 255. hence to normalize
in 0 to 1 range we need to divide it by
255 okay
so
now what we will do we will normalize
the data
so here what we'll do at X underscore
train
a question
X underscore train
divided by
255 and 0.
okay
and same for test
question test
divided by
255.0
okay to range between 0 to 1.
we will build simple artificial neutral
Network for image classification first
okay
so we will write here a n
equals to models Dot sequential
okay then I will write here
layers
Dot
platen
input underscore
shape equals to
32 comma 32 comma 3 okay
then again layers dot tens
three thousand
comma activation
pursue rialu
got it
and again 40
000 so I what I will do I will copy it
and paste it here okay
1000
so let me add one more one more layer
dot tens
then
comma
activation
also softmax
okay
here I will okay let me give for the
better visuals
yeah
so a n n
dot compile
optimizer
okay
equals to
SGD
and comma
I will write here loss
equals to
sparse
categorical
cross entropy okay
so here I will add comma then Matrix
equals to
accuracy
a n dot fit
underscore train
comma y underscore train
comma epochs
okay
so number I will give you box equals to
five
right
so it will take time to run
it's running
here there is some issue
it's
underscore train
the Box equation
five
what it is saying
and user go the file program C
engine okay
you will copy it
and paste it again
run it again
okay now it's working
okay
so it will take time and then I will get
back to you okay
then import
numpy you guys already know what numpy
is
NP
y underscore prediction
a n dot predict
X underscore test
okay then y underscore
prediction underscore
classes
equals to
NP Dot
argument Max
element
or
element
in
y underscore prediction
print
classification
both
comma classification
let's go report
then y
underscore test comma y underscore
prediction
underscore
classes
okay
so let me run this
capital
yeah
it will take less time
now we will create a graph
okay
like X text is like we have thousand
images so CLA graph will be like messed
up
still let's see
so I'd like to import
c bond as SNS
okay
C born
yeah
let me give some space
here I will write
PLT Dot
figure
because
I should be
14 comma seven
okay then as soon as we will create a
heat map for this
and Y underscore prediction
not question
true
then PLT dot y level
this truth
yeah
alt dot X label
action
then PLT dot title should be
vision
okay then PLT dot show
let me run this
okay
see why prediction has X text
it's still running
let's wait
so now let's make CNN model okay
to train our images so for that I will
add CNN equals to
models Dot
sequential
okay
we'll write a good question yeah so let
me run this
so this is our CNN model from which we
will train our images
and CNN like compile
then
optimize
optimizer
equals to
Adam
okay
comma
right here then loss
equals to
ours
categorical
you then cross
entropy
okay
and comma
I will write here Matrix
equals to
curacy
we run this
okay
those
yeah
same goes for you
okay loss
and I do rewrite this
okay now let's check CNN model
for the 10 epox
okay
let's see the accuracy is increasing or
not
CNN Dot
let's go train
comma y underscore train
comma
box
also
it is started
it will take less time than the previous
one
okay
see
you want this whole code
you can comment down the same
okay
so after completing this I will get back
to you
so it is almost done like 27 seconds
with a 10 epox
till then let me write CNN dot evaluate
underscore test
comma y underscore test
okay
so with CNN the N5 Epoch security was
around like 70 percent and which is a
significant improvement over a n okay
and then we have like just 49
okay and cnns are the best for image
classification and gives the superb
accuracy also computation is the much
less compared to simple a n as Max
pooling reduces the image Dimension
while still uh preserving these features
okay so let me run this
foreign
take some time
till then I will write y underscore
prediction
equals to CNN
Dot
predict
and X underscore test
okay
then I will write a y underscore
prediction
then column five
let me run this
so you can see the accuracy and all the
array okay
yeah
so let's
class is equals to
NP Dot
ARG Max
Lament
or
element in y prediction
then y underscore classes
then
these are the number of classes then y
underscore test
is column five
these are the array
so it's converted into array then
now let's see the it is predicting Right
image or wrong image okay by not with
the training data here we predict from
the training data while training extend
okay now we will predict from the test
data so here I will add plot
underscore sample
then
X underscore test comma y underscore
test
and you can write
the random one
so here I will write 60
let's see so you can easily see here
this is odds and it is predicting right
horse
and let me
okay
plot
let's go sample
then X underscore
test comma y underscore test
comma 100
okay
press enter
okay X is capital
yeah so you can see this is Dr
okay so our model is predicting the
correct
image
okay then what we like
let's see it is predicting the right
class or not okay we made the classes
like random classes
okay where are these these so let's see
it is predicting right or wrong
okay for that I have to write classes
but why underscore classes
like which number 60. okay
60.
360 is not defined because like number
of classes
okay okay
so there are one two three four five six
seven
okay zero to nine I can choose
so here what I will do
I will take small one
I get five
okay this is frog
okay
it's rock right
so I will take instead of 60 here I will
see frog
okay y class is not defined
by underscore classes
find see okay there are three s
yeah
so as you can see frog this is frogs so
our class is defining right so here I
will write it again like
60
it was hot
and let me write here 60
you can see the right prediction okay
so
this is what how you can you do image
classification using CNN
