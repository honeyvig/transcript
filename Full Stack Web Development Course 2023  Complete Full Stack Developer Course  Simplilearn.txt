do you know the average salary of a full
stack developer in the US can go as high
as $125,000 perom in fact according to
the US Bureau of Labor and statistics by
2024 there will be a 27% increase in the
job for developers so now is the best
time to start picking up the knowledge
needed for this career path fullsack
developers are more likely to be in
demand nowadays because every business
is moving to the internet and they are
the One-Stop shop for developing
web-based software applications today's
video will be a full course on full
stack development for 2023 starting from
the basics to the advanced topics we
will start with the small introduction
to the full stack development after that
we will see how to become a full stack
developer in 2023 moving ahead we will
learn more about HTML CSS and JavaScript
then we will discuss the Frameworks of
JavaScript which is react and angular
next we will talk about backend
development nodejs and Django after that
we will learn about SQL mongodb and see
what GitHub is and how to deploy our
project we will also talk about the
salary and skills of a full stack
developer finally we have lined up an
interview questions and answer series
for you guys to help you land a great
job in the fullstack domain so without
further Ado let's get into this full
course hey everyone I'm sure you're all
aware that every application that you
use today has something thing called the
front end which is the user interface
and the back end which is the software
that accesses data for us and finally we
have the data base to store the data now
these three together form something
called as the full stack so hi guys
welcome to this video on what is full
stack by simply LA but before we begin
if you haven't subscribed to our Channel
already make sure to hit the Subscribe
button and the bell icon to never miss
an update so here's what's in store for
you first first we'll have a look at
what front- end development is then
we'll see some of the front end
languages then we'll move on to some
frontend libraries and
Frameworks then we'll see what backend
development is understand some of the
popularly used backend languages and
Frameworks and finally we'll have a look
at the database so now what exactly is
front end every time you open a website
it has several UI components and once
you click on a particular icon say sign
in in this case you get navigated to the
signin or the login page right so what
happens is that all of these items
facilitate navigation and
utility these are collectively called as
the front end so the front end is the
visible part of the website or the web
application which is responsible for
user experience the user directly
interacts with the front end portion of
the website or the web
application so now let's have a look at
some of the front- end languages so I'm
sure you've heard of HTML CSS and
JavaScript so these are collectively
called the front-end languages when it
comes to HTML it defines the structure
of websites and formats the web pages it
also defines text documentation so let's
look at a simple example if getting your
learning started is half the battle what
if you could do that for free visit
skillup by simply learn click on the
link in the description to know more so
here I've made use of the H1 tag which
is the heading tag in HTML and I've
displayed the message hello welcome so
correspondingly my website displays the
same message so HTML is responsible or
it defines what is being shown on the
website next up is CSS now CSS is a
stylesheet that allows you to alter and
style different web components beat size
font spacing Etc it makes the content on
the website look more decorative correct
so now if you have a look at the code
here I've added some styling I've
changed the font style to italic I've
made the text bold and I've changed the
color to red and again correspondingly
all the changes are seen on the
website moving on we have JavaScript now
JavaScript is a very powerful client
side scripting language and it is meanly
used for enhancing the interaction of a
user with the web page so again if if
you have a look at the code here I've
created a form wherein the user can
enter their name and I've also displayed
the message please enter your name as a
result an input box is made available
where the user can type in their name
now this is facilitated by JavaScript so
as I mentioned earlier it is used to
make web pages interactive and bring the
web applications to life so next let's
have a look at some front end Frameworks
and libraries now most of these are
JavaScript Frameworks and libraries
first we have react
then there's angular there's view
there's jQuery and then there's
bootstrap now all of these help develop
the front end of the application however
when it comes to react angular in view
it's not necessary that you must know
everything to create a website one of
them will be sufficient however the
usage of react is on the rise and most
of the developers prefer using react
jQuery and bootstrap are also powerful
Frameworks that can be used to create
interactive web pages now that you know
what front end development is you must
be wondering how the data is being
fetched and how this data is being
presented in front of you on your screen
correct now this is all facilitated by
the back end of the application so let's
understand what backend development
is now backend basically refers to the
server side development of the
application it is responsible for
managing all the database with the help
of queries and AP I so every time the
user makes a request it queries the
database and retrieves the data from the
database and presents it to the user and
lastly it ensures data
consistency so now let's have a look at
some backend languages and
Frameworks firstly we have node node and
expressjs are packages provided by
JavaScript then there's python which is
a very popularly used language python
Frameworks like d Jango and flask are
popularly used to create the back end of
applications then there's Java and Java
provides spring and Java server faces
which are also used for backend
development then there's cop which
provides Frameworks like asp.net core
and asp.net MVC and other popularly used
backend languages are PHP that's Pearl
and Ruby database is the collection of
interrelated data which helps in
efficient retrieval insertion and
deletion of data from database and
organizes the data in the form of tables
views schemas reports now some of the
commonly used database Management
systems are MySQL there's postra SQL
there's Microsoft SQL Server there's
Oracle database and then there's mongodb
but how can we at simply learn help you
if you wish to make a career as a full
stack developer then a certification
will come in handy for that you could
head to our official website and look
for fullstack development courses now we
offer the fullstack Java developer
Masters
program we also provide the postgraduate
program in fullstack web development and
we also provide the fullstack web
developer meanstack Masters program you
can go ahead and click on the program
and have a look at the overview if this
suits your requirements you can go ahead
and purchase the course is how to become
a fullstack developer so let's begin
so here are the topics that we're going
to be discussing so first we'll see what
fullstack development is who is a
fullstack developer then we'll move on
to the responsibilities and then we'll
dive into the detailed road map and then
it also let you know about the salaries
of fullstack developers and finally how
you can get
certifications all right now what
exactly is full stack development now
consider a web application let's say
Instagram so every time you refresh the
page new images are
loaded so this is what the user
experiences right new images are loaded
onto his feet but what exactly happens
behind the scenes is that the back end
fetches new images from the Instagram
servers and these images are then loaded
onto your Instagram feed right the app
is so easy to use and leaves the users
extremely
satisfied in case of any application
there's always the front end the back
end and the database so the process of
building all of these aspects for an
application is called Full stack
development so I hope you understood
what exactly full stack development
is so moving on let's see who a
fullstack developer
is now basically a fullstack developer
works with both front end and the back
end of an
application he has to be familiar with
languages like HTML CSS JavaScript and
also one or more backend Frameworks like
node.js and
python now these developers have got all
the web development skills to build
websites and applications from start to
finish now that we've understood what
exactly a fullsack developer does let's
look at some of his
responsibilities now the first
responsibility is developing the front
end so as discussed they must be able to
develop the user interface for the users
with the help of HTML and
CSS next up is design the back end now
this is also the most crucial part of
app development they should be able to
design robust backend architecture to
ensure the smooth functioning of
fetching and
updation next up is to design database
and servers now databases and servers
must be resilient to any outages and
must maintain consistency
next up is crossplatform
compatibility now depending on the
platforms there could be some
discrepancy and alteration in the
functioning of an application right it's
crucial to make sure that the
applications behave accordingly on all
these
platforms next up is developing apis
depending on the pl architecture the
developer must be able to develop
apis the application must also be
responsive and interactive and keep the
user are completely
engaged and lastly it should meet all
the technical and consumer
requirements so these were the few
responsibilities of a full stack
developer moving on let me explain to
you a simple road map of how to go about
to become a fullstack
developer so this road map basically
shows you the prerequisites and skills
one should have to become a successful
fullstack developer
all right so let's go ahead and begin
with tools and software now the first
and the most rudimentary requirement is
a text editor now the most widely used
editor is vs code it is free open source
and can be used to code in different
platforms like Windows Mac OS and
Linux next up is a web browser so you
can either use Firefox or Chrome but
Chrome is highly
preferred now also you could need a few
edited extensions and vs code has a few
of them some of them could be live SAS
compiler and live
server moving on you need to have a good
hold on HTML and CSS so HTML is a markup
language that is used to define the
content that appear on your web page
right the developer can incorporate
images text and videos depending on the
requirements and moving on to CSS it is
basically a St sheet which is used to
decorate your entire application it is
used to define the appearance of the
content say in terms of shape color size
spacing
Etc next up is Javascript now this is
the most widely used front-end language
and enhances the interaction with the
web page now you might want to brush up
your knowledge on simple Concepts like
arrays functions objects and Loops you
can also learn es6 features like call
backs promises Ayn
await Dom manipulation and event fetch
API and Json all of these are required
when you're making use of different
JavaScript Frameworks and libraries so
I'd recommend you brush up your
knowledge on all of these
topics react angular View and jQuery are
some of the JavaScript libraries and
Frameworks that one can use now all of
these topics that we discussed earlier
be it ESX features or basic concepts
they come in very hand handy when you're
using these
Frameworks among react View and angular
over the last couple of years react has
gained immense popularity followed by
which view is also being widely used now
angular has seen a downward curve over
the past few years so depending on your
requirements you can choose one of these
Frameworks next up is Version Control
now git and GitHub are the most widely
used Version Control Systems now git
basically helps you manage project files
git basically keeps track of the entire
history of things that the user is
working on right so it makes sure that
it allows the user to backtrack and see
what he's worked on until then moving on
to GitHub it is basically a web based
service for Version Control using git
now the user can also look into other
people's code identify issues or errors
and also even propose changes now this
comes in extremely helpful when you're
working in a team
let's move ahead and look at some of the
backend environment now the most
popularly used environment is nodejs now
this is basically an open-source
cross-platform runtime environment that
allows developers to create server side
tools and applications in JavaScript now
node is typically used to create
realtime applications with two-way
connections where in both the client and
the servers can communicate and exchange
data without any hassle now I'd really
recommend you have a basic knowledge on
command line as well that is now
knowledge on basic command line like npm
that is note package manager is also
essential so this was a simple overview
on
nodejs moving on to other backend
languages there's Python and the most
commonly used framework that is D Jango
now python is the easiest programming
language out there and I'm sure
everybody will agree with me with this
so it also offers many libraries and
Frameworks for different Technologies so
when it comes to back end in full stack
development Jango is a clear winner now
it is a highlevel python framework that
enables rapid development of websites it
is also free and open source and has a
huge active community of users so I'd
really suggest you get your hands on
Django and work on it
extensively moving on let me give you a
brief overview on the trends in 2020
first up is
blockchain now blockchain is an emerging
technology and has seen tremendous
growth in the last few years now it has
also entered into domains like
healthcare and
finance next up is AI and chat Bots AI
is booming and there is no doubt in that
so languages like Python and JavaScript
Frameworks like tens of floor are widely
used mobile mobile app development this
is one of the top trends you should look
out for in 2020 now there are mobile
applications for practically anything
these days so Frameworks like react
native and flutter can be deployed to
develop these
applications next up is Progressive web
applications now these are like a hybrid
of mobile and web apps they are faster
to load and provide some amazing
features like push notifications another
important feature is their ability to
work offline
lastly we have iot with the increasing
number of devices getting connected to
the internet every second development of
iot applications is also on a
rise so these were the few trends that
you should look out for in
2020 moving ahead let's look at the
salary of fullstack
developers now according to pay scale
the average salary of a fullstack
developer in India is around 590,000
rupees per
anom the average salary of a fullstack
developer in the US is around
$75,000 per
anom all right so moving on to the fun
part let's go ahead and look at a simple
quiz now here is a quiz question which
of the following is not a JavaScript
framework or a
library option A react option b angular
ker option C pandas or option D bu so
let us know your answer in the chat
section one lucky winner will get a
voucher so I'll keep this on the screen
for a
while mind you which of the following is
not a JavaScript framework or a
library so comment your answer
immediately
all right so moving ahead let me tell
you how simply learn can help
you now there are several online
certification courses but if you're
looking for something that is concise
and well structured then head out to the
simply learn website and here you can
see a few options you have the full
stack Java developer Masters program you
have the fullstack developer.net Masters
program and you also have fullstack web
developer mean stack master's
program you can also go through the
overview and depending on your
requirement you can choose the
appropriate
course hey guys I'm sure you all have
heard about phrases like web development
full stack development front-end and
backend
development but if you are not sure
about what exactly they mean or how
they're different then don't worry
you're in the right place this video on
front end versus back in development
will help you differentiate the
two but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our Channel already make
sure to hit the Subscribe button and the
bell icon to never miss an
update now let's Jump Right In and look
at what's in store for
us so first we look at what exactly web
development is then we look at the
different types of web
development going ahead we look at what
front-end development is and understand
what exactly backend development
is and lastly we'll be comparing the two
on the basis of languages libraries and
Frameworks skills job roles and
Sater so now let's begin by
understanding what web development
is web development is the process of
creating a website on the
internet it refers to the non-design
aspects of a website such as creating
features and functionality using
programming markup and scripting
languages developers concentrate on the
technical aspects of web development
such as architecture programming
application integration and
Graphics now let's look at the different
types of web
development now web development could
include the front end and the back end
now
together they form something called as
full stack development
now I'm sure you're wondering what they
actually mean so let's go ahead and
understand
them let's begin by understanding what
front-end development
is now front end development is the part
of the website that codes and creates
front-end elements of a website which
are features that are directly viewable
and accessible by the client now
essentially a front end developer is in
charge of everything you see be it
styling Graphics text alignment
navigation colors Etc and he attempts
and he attempts to improve the user
experience to make it as seamless as
possible now these front-end developers
also contribute to the overall design
and aesthetic along with
debugging responsiveness and performance
are the two main objectives of front-end
development then what exactly is backing
development you guessed it right
now web development that occurs at the
back end of programs is accurately
termed as backend
development now this backend development
covers serverside web application logic
and integration and activities like
writing apis creating libraries and
working with system competence as
opposed to front-end development which
focuses on customer facing services and
programs now backend developers create
code that allows database and an
application to communicate with each
other
essentially a backend developer handles
what you don't see we are in charge of
the back end of the website which
includes servers data bases and
applications so now that you have a
brief understanding of what frontend
development is and backend development
is let's go ahead and compare the
two so we'll be comparing the two based
on five different features that is
languages libraries and Frameworks
skills job roles and S
ities now let's begin with languages now
front end development typically includes
coding using languages like HTML CSS and
JavaScript now as you all know HTML is a
markup language that is standardized
system for tagging text files to achieve
font color graphics and hyperlinks now
CSS is used to format the layout of
these web pages and JavaScript is used
to create interactive elements on the
web
page when it comes to back end the
languages include python chash Java
Pearl PHP Ruby and some JavaScript now
Java in particular was built from ground
up to run on the server side so Java is
extremely useful python is also one of
the most popularly used languages and C
language is the preferred architecture
for backend programming in Windows
environments now talking about libraries
and Frameworks front-end libraries and
Frameworks include react JS angular view
jQuery and bootstrap while talking about
backend Frameworks we have Express JS
node spring Django flask JSF asp.net and
net
MVC now frontend and backend developers
work very closely so it's helpful to
have a foundational understanding of
front-end developer Technologies like
HTML and CSS as well moving on to skills
now frontend Developers are in charge of
bringing visual elements to a website as
well as interactive elements such as
navigation buttons and anything else
that improves overall
usability HTML JavaScript and CSS are
frequently used to ensure that a site's
visual side operates well so it's
crucial to know these languages and a
good understanding of JavaScript
Frameworks and libraries is also
essential and other General skills
include a good grasp of frontend
programming languages the ability to
create responsive design the knowledge
of testing and debugging and an
understanding of front-end development
tools like automation content management
Version Control
Systems talking about the skills
required for backend
development now backend developers deal
with backend languages and Frameworks
like Java Ruby on Rails Etc now backend
developers deal with languages like Java
Ruby on Rails Etc to make web pages and
applications Operate Now with it's vital
to know commonly used backend languages
and Frameworks like d Jango nodejs
expressjs and so on other important
skills include database management
framework utilization programming
knowledge of accessibility and security
compliance and understanding
requirements and ensuring data
consistency and
integrity now moving ahead let's look at
some of the job roles for front end and
backend development talking about front
end we have the front end developer the
CSS or h HML developer we have front-end
web designer we have frontend SEO expert
full stack developer and a UI
developer talking about backend there's
backend developer Java developer full
stack developer devops engineer software
engineer and an iOS
Developer and lastly let's look at the
salaries offered to these front-end and
backend
developers in India the average salary
of a front content developer is around 6
lakh rupees
perom while a backend developer earns
about 7 lakh rupees perom in the US a
front-end developer earns around
$100,000 perom while a backend developer
earns about
$121,000 perom question will be about
today's topic which is become a
front-end developer so let us begin we
going to discuss the things you need to
know to become a web developer first we
will start with basic skills which every
web developer must know before moving
into more advanced web Frameworks then
we will understand what react is and why
it is so popular after that we will go
through another web framework called
angular then we will also get to know
about a comparatively new front end
framework called view in the end we will
go through the frontend developer salary
Trends which will give you an Insight of
of the job market so without further Ado
let's get
started first the basic skills let us
understand what basic skills are
required to become a web developer there
are a few recommendations in that you
must learn for either path these are the
common things every programmer should
know the first one is the
GitHub so git is a free open- source
version control system that enables
collaborations in a particular project
it is designed to handle both small and
large scale projects git is a tool used
to save code and create different
versions to better manage the feature
updates in the product or an application
so followed by the GitHub the next
important thing we have is the data
structures and algorithms a data
structure is the location used to store
and organize data an algorithm is a
collection of steps to solve a
particular
problem learning data structures and
algorithms allow us write efficient and
fast computer programs so followed by
data structures and algorithms we have
the text editor get familiar with a text
editor of your choice Visual Studio code
is the top choice for most of the web
developers and my personal choice too
because of the large support of
languages and of course the
speed the text editor is where you write
all your code and the terminal is where
you execute it so followed by the text
editor we have the command line
the command line is an important tool to
get familiar with it is how you run your
code after writing it on a text editor
the better you are on the command line
the more efficient you'll be as a
developer so followed by the command
line we have the HTTP and https the HTTP
protocol is the backbone of the
internet it handles requests and
responses from a web application it is
mandatory for a web developer to have
good knowledge of both HTTP and https in
order to build fast and responsive web
applications now that we know what basic
skills are required to become a frontend
developer let's discuss about the most
popular front-end library that is the
react now what exactly react
is so react is a front-end JavaScript
library used for building beautiful user
interface
components it is an open source meaning
it can be used in your commercial
projects without any restrictions
it is also component based and these
components can be used again and again
promoting code
reusability it is an MVC or model view
controller architecture react is the V
responsible for how the application
looks and feels for the end user now why
should you learn react react has always
been in high performance as it uses
virtual Doom rather in real do M so
basically Doom stands for document
object model and is used by every
internet browser for rendering a web
page or an
application react can also be easily
integrated with other JavaScript
Frameworks like no JS resulting in the
development of a completely new web
application including front end and the
back
end it is comparatively easy to maintain
large scale applications written in real
act because it highly promotes code
reusability and code
readability so followed by react the
next important thing we have is the
angular we have an idea of what react is
but it is not the only framework used
for building user interfaces so now let
us know about angular so now what
exactly angular is angular unlike react
is a fully fletched framework for web
application development which usually
does not require additional libraries
for implementing additional
functionalities like routing it is also
open source and backed by Google and as
regularly updated resulting in
constantly improved performance and
addition of new features in terms of
performance it was expect to be much
slower than react but with the recent
versions performance seems to be on par
with
react now why should you learn angular
angular is one of the most stable
Frameworks out there it is also the most
complete meaning you don't have the need
to integrate with other Frameworks since
it's pretty much includes everything for
the web development of a complete web
application angular back by Google is
safe choice for using in long-term
project since it is not going anywhere
anytime
soon angular is obviously used by Google
for its web applications and also used
by other large scale companies creating
a lot of job opportunities
now followed by angular the next one we
have is the view now that we know quite
a bit about the two popular front and
Frameworks namely react and angular
let's now go ahead into view and learn a
bit more about vue.js
library now what exactly is
view view is a lightweight and open-
Source Progressive JavaScript framework
used for developing interactive web user
interfaces it is meant to be integrated
with other libraries to develop a
complete web
application like react vuejs is mainly
focused on The View part of the web
application and hence it's bit faster
when compared to angular which is a
complete web application
solution vue.js is commonly referred to
as View and pronounced as vuejs or view
is rightly so now why should you learn
view any beginner web developer can
easily understand View and start
building their own web user
interfaces like react view also uses
virtual Doom resulting in better
performance and it also uses a component
based code design promoting code
reusability and code
readability vue.js has become popular in
recent times and many companies are
starting to use it owing to its
lightweight performance and easy
integration with other web libraries and
Frameworks now with this let's move into
the next section where we will discuss
about the front end developer salary
Trends now that we know what skills we
need to become a front-end developer
let's now have a look into the salary
returns of a front-end
developer front end developers are
always in high demand since new web
applications are launched and managed
continuously there are generally offered
generous salaries across the
globe the salaries also depend depend on
the factors like Frameworks skills and
the work experience the average salary
of a front-end developer in India is 5
lakh 6,000 rupees per anom the average
salary of a frontend developer in United
States is
$6,999 US per
anom website architecture website
architecture basically defines the
design and structure of a website a
website contains two important parts the
front end and the back end the front end
of any website is something the user
came across we can also state it as the
client side of any website whatever the
user of the website sees while going
through any particular website is
considered as front end HTML CSS and
JavaScript are the three most popular
and mainly used Technologies which are
responsible for the development of the
graphical user interface the combination
of these three Technologies is
responsible for giving a smooth and
appealing user experience on the other
hand anything the user doesn't witness
while going through the website but
actually exists somewhere in the website
and the server is known as the back end
of a website whenever we visit a page
and send a request for the content the
server goes through the database and
then creates a response that is sent
back to the browser the browser then
interprets the response and displays the
content on the scol several Technologies
are used for backend development few of
them are JavaScript Frameworks like
nodejs and nextjs python Frameworks like
Django Ruby Frameworks like Ruby on
Rails C++ Frameworks like Apache and
many more other technology let's move
ahead and we'll now go through what HTML
is HTML stands for hyper text markup
language introduced in the year 1993 by
Tim Berner SLE the same person who
invented the worldwide web in the year
1989 the first version of HTML was
written in 1991 but released later in
1993 as HTML
1.0 HTML got many updates with time and
the current ongoing version of HTML is
HTML
5.0 HTML is also known as the most basic
building block of the web which is used
to create the structure of any website
with the help of numerous predefined
tags it helps the browser to understand
the structure and style of a document or
file for viewing over the
Internet it allows our web pages to host
videos images and other applications it
also facilitates navigation within web
pages or between websites through
hypertext hypertext refers to the links
present in any website to connect
different web pages and create a whole
website HTML has a lot of use cases web
development HTML code is used to design
how a browser displays web page elements
such as text hyperlinks and media files
internet navigation users can easily
navigate and insert links between
related pages and websites as HTML is
heavily used to embed hyperlinks web
documentations HTML makes it possible to
organize and format documents similarly
to Microsoft Word moving on to the
installation part HTML does not require
any special software to work if you have
notepad installed in your system that's
enough to start using HTML the best part
about HTML is its ease of use let's move
on on to the editor's part now and will
then download a particular editor for a
complete HTML playlist an editor or IDE
which stands for integrated development
environment is a software application
that comprehends facilities to a
programmer for software development just
like Photoshop makes it easier to edit
photos in the same way IDE makes it
easier for a programmer to write code
the number of idees present in the
market today is huge
some of these editors are notepad++ atom
and vs C these editors are free to use
on the other hand editors like Sublime
are free but with some limitations to
access all the features of sublime we
have to go for the premium version for
the license and then we can use it for
software development my personal choice
for an editor is the visual studio code
there's a reason behind using vs code as
an editor Let Me tell you a few
advantages of vs code over other editors
first of all it is free to use as it is
opsource software so we can get it at no
cost it supports multiple programming
languages there's nothing like we need
any web support or work on different
editors for different programming
languages we can use vs code for
different languages as well extensions
are also one of the main reason behind
using vs code suppose we want to use a
programming language it does not support
all we have to do is to add an extension
and we are good to it also does not
affect the editor's speed as it runs as
a different process besides all these
properties one main key factor behind
using vs code is its availability in
different platforms like it is available
for Mac Linux and windows so I think
there are enough features we have
discussed till now there are many more
features that we'll discuss while
installing and working with vs code
let's start with the installation part
now the installation process for vs code
is pretty simple just go to Google and
write here vs
code press enter and the next page which
will open will show us the results click
on the first link over here and we are
here at the website of vs code right now
you can see the download button in front
of your screen you can click on it and
you can download the stable version for
your operating system system from here
only or you can go to the other download
button present at the top right corner
of your screen click on the button over
here so you can see here we have all the
extensions as well these are the top
extensions we have to download them
inside vs code once the downloading part
overs so here you can see the download
Starts Now sit back and relax until the
download finishes once the download
completes open the setup file from your
downloads and it will take us to the
license agreement page now agree over
here click on next and it will take us
to the browser part so here what we have
to do is we have to choose a location
for the vs code file to locate so you
can choose any location so for now I'm
clicking on next over here now you can
see we have a different folder so we can
click on browse and then select it and
then click on next so here we can see we
have some additional features so what
we'll do is we'll create a desktop icon
now you can see other options as well so
click on them as well click on next and
now click on install the installation
will start once we are done with the
installation part click on finish and
the vs code will start automatically
fine so here you can see we have the
welcome page over here what we can do is
we can open a folder from here so if you
have any folder so what we can do is we
can open it from here now what we'll do
is we'll create a new file so here you
can see we are in a file what we have to
do is we have to save this file now so
click on file click on Save and now we
can save this file at any place or any
location we can see so what we are going
to do is we are going to go on desktop
we are going to create a new folder over
here we are going to name it as HTML now
inside HTML what we are going to do is
we are going to write here the name of
our file so we'll write here first then
we'll write here the extension so what
we have to do is we have to write here
first
HTML and here you can see we have an
HTML file over here right so you can see
we have four options over here the first
one is for opening a folder or any
particular location so click on open
folder now what we are going to do is we
are going to open HTML over here and you
can see we have the HTML folder open now
we have the file over here as first.
HTML which we created recently then we
have the search button over here to
search anything or to replace anything
anything the next button we have over
here is for the source control then
after this we have the debug Button as
well and then we have the extension so
these are the features vs code provides
us and below here we have the accounts
option and the settings option what we
can do from here is we can change the
font size and different settings right
now the next button we are going to
discuss is the extensions button here we
can find many extensions given by the vs
code Studio Community the are free to
use so for now we'll use these two or
three extension so what we can do is
we'll click on HTML CSS support so you
can see I have already installed these
extensions over here so then we have
JavaScript and typescript nightly and
the live server extension so this
extension is pretty important the live
server one and the HTML CSS support you
can leave the JavaScript and typescript
nightly for now so we have to install
these two extensions for now so I have
already installed it you can install
them in your computer now the next thing
we have to do is so we can start writing
a code here on I've already told you
that while saving any file make sure
that we are saving that file with a HTML
extension so what we have to do here is
we have to put an exclamation mark over
here and press enter and you can see we
have the basic HTML code which will need
in almost every we can simply start with
it if we have basic computer knowledge
we got you covered if you are a newb to
HTML please stay connected with us and
you guys will understand HTML in a very
fun and exciting way before we go
through the different tags present in
HTML let's discuss what a tag is a tag
refers to a special word wrapped in
angular brackets which are used to
define a particular type of content on a
web page after using a tag in an HTML
file the browser decides how to render
or display the content on the screen the
list of tags present in HTML is pretty
huge we'll go through some basic tags in
today's video and we'll go through the
remaining tags while working with them
so let's start with the most basic tag
we have in HTML you can see here we have
a basic program written over here all
the tags mentioned over here are
mandatory for all HTML programs the
first thing we have here is the doc type
as HTML you can see it over here we have
written doc type HTML so this is not an
HTML tag but an instruction for the
system about the type of document
basically we are telling the system that
this is going to be an HTML document so
that all the browsers can know that this
particular document is an HTML document
and work
accordingly the next tag we have here is
the HTML tag you can see the HTML tag
starts from here and goes till add right
we have ended this HTML tag at the end
of a HTML
document now this tag is necessary for
all HTML documents if you are working on
an HTML document then this tag is what
we are going to need the HTML tag
represents the root and the end of the
whole document this is a container tag
that contains all the other tags within
it so this tag is pretty mandatory in
all HTML document now the next tag we
have here is the head tag you can see
the head tag over here and the ending of
this head tag is present over here we
have certain tags present inside this
particular tag now you can see that this
head tag contains meta tags and the
title tag right you can see the meta tag
over here we have three meta tags and
then we have a title tag as well now the
meta tags doesn't appear on the page
itself but only in the pages Source
codol meta tags are essentially little
content descriptors that help search
engines what a web page is all about now
the next tag we have here is the title
tag the title tag is used to define the
title of a web page basically we write
the name of a web page inside this tag
for example if we see here the title of
a web page is document for now if we
change the title of this HTML document
and write here something
like first document fine now save the
program open it with live server now you
can see it over here that the window
window name is changed to first document
there's no change in the web page itself
so what we are going to do is we are
going to reduce the size of a vs code
and the browser we are going to keep
them side by side here so that any
changes we made in this HTML document
are reflected in the web browser other
tags we can use inside the head tag are
the style tag the script tag and the
link tag now the link tag is used to
link any external CSS file to a HTML
page we have to provide the source of
that file and then any styling changes
we make in that particular file will get
reflected in the web for that so let's
create a CSS file first what we are
going to do is we are going to create
another file over here let's name it as
style. CSS now this particular file has
CSS as extension this will tell the
browser that this particular file is a
CSS file and we are going to use it for
styling purpose fine so we have this
style. CSS over here now we are going to
link this with our HTML document for
that what we have to do is we have to
write here link so this is the tag now
we have to write here re and we have to
write
here
stylesheet fine now the next thing we
have to do is to provide the source code
of this particular file so for that we
are going to use href href is going to
be style. CSS now close this link tag
now this ra tag over here specifies the
relationship between the current
document and the link document now you
can see it over here we have this Rel as
stylesheet this means that this
particular file is a stylesheet and we
are going to use this for styling
purpose another important tag we have
inside the head section is the script
tag this tag is used to declare or use
any script within the HTML document
basically used for JavaScript so it's
not necessary to use this tag within the
head section only we can use it anywhere
but for now we are going to use it
inside the head tag the syntax is also
easy we have to write it like script SRC
now SRC is going to be the file name so
let's add another file over here we'll
write first. JS so this will tell the
browser that this particular file is a
Javascript file so we are going to write
here inside this now we are going to
write first. yes now we have to define
the type as well so type is going to be
text and the file is a Javascript file
so we'll write here JavaScript fine now
close this tag and the script tag will
closes automatically you can see it over
fine the script tag is
closed keep one thing in mind that we
have to close the script tag every time
but the link tag is not necessary to
close the next tag we are going to
discuss is the body
tag the body tag defines the document's
body now you can see it over here if we
go back to HTML page you can see the
body tag over here now the body element
contains all the content of an HTML
document such as headings paragraphs
images hyperlinks tables lists Etc there
can only be one body element in an HTML
document any tag we are going to use
within the body tag is going to define
the structure of a web page now the next
tag we are going to use is the heading
tag there are six different types of
heading tags starting from H1 and goes
to H6 H1 refers to the most important
heading and H6 refers to the least
important the font size of H1 is the
largest and the font size of H6 is the
smallest among all so let's use them all
here what we'll do is we'll write here
H1 now inside this H1 we'll write this
is heading one save the program and you
can see it over here we have a heading
in our web page which says this is
heading one similarly we have the h2 tag
as well so if we write here H2 and
inside this if we write this is heading
two save the program you can see the
change in the font size you can see the
difference over here the font for H1 is
greater and the font for H2 is a bit
smaller than H1 similarly we have
H3 and for H3 we are going to write here
this
is heading c three fine then we have H4
as well so we are going to write here h
four and inside this we are going to
write this is
heading F fine similarly we have H5 and
H6 as well so we are going to mention
them first here so we'll write here this
is heading 5 and finally we have
H6 which is used for heading six so we
are going to write here this is
heading six fine save the program and
you can see the difference in all the
headings over here the size for H1 is
the largest and the size for heading six
is the smallest we can use any of these
headings according to
ours similarly we have the paragraph tag
as well in HTML it is used to write a
paragraph or any content within the web
page the syntax is simple we have to use
the P tag for that so if we write here p
and now inside this paragraph tag
whatever thing we'll write so let's say
we are writing here this is a first
HTML document fine now save this program
and you can see it over here we have
some text present in the web browser
right so these are the most basic HTML
tags we discussed in today's video as we
said the list of tags is large and will
discuss them while working with them so
please go through these tags on your own
and let us know if you face any
issue we have already discussed about
tags in the last video we came across
several important tags in the previous
video like the HTML head and the body
tags a simple definition of tags states
that a tag refers to a special word
wrapped in angular brackets which are
used to define a particular type of
content on a web page after using a tag
in an HTML file the browser decides how
to render or display the content on the
screen right now keeping this definition
in mind the definition of an element in
HTML states that an HTML element is the
collection of a start tag its attributes
an end tag and everything in between the
tags right so an HTML element is
basically a collection let's understand
this with the help of an example what
we'll do is we'll write over here inside
the body of this HTML document
we'll
write P fine now this paragraph tag over
here is an example of a tag it has
opening tag and a closing tag so this
whole thing is a tag this paragraph is a
tag over
here now if we add an attribute to this
tag like an ID or a class so what we'll
do for that we'll write here let's say
ID is equals
to par fine this tag now has an
attribute within it ID makes this whole
tag unique we can access the content of
this tag with the help of ID attribute
we'll discuss attributes in detail in
the upcoming video for now let's add
some content inside this tag so what
we'll do is we'll write inside this tab
we'll write over here let's
say this is
a paragraph fine so we'll write here
paragraph So This is the content of
paragraph tag now we have four different
parts present over here we have the
starting tag over here so this is the
starting tag this whole thing over here
is the starting tag then we have
attribute so ID here is the attribute
then we have the content of this tag so
this is the content present inside whole
tag and then we have the end part of a
paragraph Tex so this represents the end
part right so the combination of these
four things is known as the HTML
element now let's talk about the case
sensitivity of HTML tags so HTML tags
are not case sensitive so you can see we
have paragraph tag over here with small
P present inside angular brackets what
we can do is we can write here capital P
as well so these two things are pretty
same so let's write something inside
this as well so let's say we are writing
here this
is par paragraph 2 fine so this is the
content present inside this paragraph
tag with capital P inside angular
brackets now save the program and you
can see we have two paragraphs over here
the first one says this is a paragraph
and the second one says this is a
paragraph 2 so what we have to do is we
have to remove a from here save it now
and now it says this is paragraph 2
fine so I hope you guys got that HTML
tags are not case sensitive
fine now let's move ahead and we'll now
discuss empty elements in
HTML most HTML elements have a start tag
and an end tag that indicate where the
element begins and where it ends for
example we have this paragraph tag over
here this is the start of this paragraph
tag and this is the end part right so
this indicates that this paragraph tag
ends over
here now there is a group of elements
that are exceptions to this Ru so these
elements are called empty or void and
only have a start tag since they have no
content present inside the tag so they
must not have an end tag in HTML example
of empty elements are like the Break Tag
we have we have image link and many more
such tags the list is quite long so what
we'll do is We'll add an image using the
image tag so image tag is basically an
empty element so we'll use that
particular element and you guys will
understand what empty elements are so as
mentioned earlier that empty elements do
not require any closing tag so what
we'll do is we'll write here inside
angular brackets IMG is the tag name
then we'll write here SRC so SRC over
here is attribute we'll discuss
attributes in upcoming videos so inside
this we'll provide the path of our image
so let's say we
have this image present
inside images folder which is a folder
present in a system so where we are
saving all our HTML programs so the next
thing we'll write here is alt alt stand
for alternate so if the image is not
shown over the browser then the
alternate text will be shown so let's
say we are writing here image one now
we'll close this image tag so that's all
we don't have to close this particular
image tag we don't have to write here
like this so you can see we don't have
to write here like this anything so if
we not write it over here
that's fine because image element is an
empty element so let's save the program
and you can see we have an image over
here in the browser so the image size is
quite large what we'll do is we'll
reduce the side so we'll write
here this for
now we'll discuss all these things in
the upcoming video so don't worry about
it for now you can see that we have an
image over here so this is our image
this particular image is what we have
added using the image tag
so this is done now the last thing we'll
discuss in this video is the nesting of
elements nesting means we can use the
tag or element within another element
for example you can see we have a
paragraph over here so this is a
paragraph which says this is paragraph 2
let's add some more things over here so
let's say we are writing over
here HTML stands
for hyper
textup language
fine and save the program so this is the
paragraph over here you can see let me
increase the size of our browser a bit
so now I think you guys can see it much
better now what we'll do is we'll use a
particular element or tag within this
paragraph tag so let's say we want this
HTML to be cursive and bold in nature so
what we'll do over here is we'll use the
B tag over here so b stands for bold
so what we'll do next is we'll cut HTML
from here and we'll paste it inside this
bag now save the program and you can see
HTML is bold in nature right similarly
what we can do is we can Nest one more
tag inside this bold tag so what we can
do is we'll write here I now we have to
put this HTML inside both these texts
save this program and you can see the
HTML is cursive in nature now so you can
see we have three different Texs or we
can say we have two different tags
inside a particular Tex this is known as
nesting of elements so we can do it with
HTML as well I hope you guys must have
got an idea about what HTML elements are
and how elements are different from tags
in
HTML in the last part we came across
HTML elements we saw the difference
between HTML tags and elements now that
we already have an idea about elements
let's discuss what
attributes let me write the basic syntax
of an HTML element over here first so
what we'll do is we'll write over here
let's use the paragraph Tech so we are
writing over here this is
a basic
example of elements in HTM fine I hope
you guys must have got an idea about
what this is this is actually a basic HT
ml element we have nothing else over
here just a simple example of HTML
element an element consist of start teag
an ending tag and the content within the
tag right so this particular thing is an
element now attributes in HTML refer to
the additional Properties or
characteristics of an element for
example if we write here let's suppose
we are writing over here let's say we
are writing over here ID
as par one fine now save this program
and you you can see over here that we
have a paragraph which says this is a
basic example of elements in HTML now we
have this whole element with IDs par one
or we can give any ID of our choice now
this ID is unique for this particular
element for now you don't have to worry
much about this ID or any other
attribute just focus on what attributes
are we are going through the working of
attributes basically so we can use the
ID of this attribute to style this
particular element so basically this ID
attribute defines what this HTML element
is we have to use the style tag element
or we can say we have to use the style
element for styling this particular
paragraph you will understand it once we
go through the tag so let's do it over
here what we'll do is we'll use the
style tag over here so we'll write Here
style you can see this is a style
element basically it has start tag it
has ending tag now we'll write some
content inside this particular Tex so
let's say we are writing over here
hash par one now in inside this what
we'll do is we'll Define some styling
properties so let's say we are writing
over here background color as red and
we'll write here color so this color
here refers to the font color basically
so we'll write here blue now save this
program and you can see the paragraph in
a browser is changed so what we did here
is inside this style element we access
this particular ID so ID is unique for
each element we'll discuss it later on
so basically this particular paragraph
tag has an ID named parel so we are
using that particular ID then we have
some CSS properties so these properties
are used to style a particular element
so we have used it over here you can see
it over here if I zoom out a bit in the
browser you can see the background color
of this whole paragraph is red and the
font color is blue fine what we want to
say here is this ID over here is
basically an attribute it is used to
identify or change a particular element
we have many attributes present in HTML
so we'll go through some of them let's
say we are adding an image over here so
let's add an image and you guys will
understand about HTML attributes here as
well so we'll write here IMG so this is
basically an empty element we have
discussed it in the previous part
wherein we went through HTML elements
now what we'll do is we'll write here
SRC now SRC is also an attribute this
attribute is used to provide the system
with the source of of a image so if we
go back to this particular HTML folder
so here we have a HTML folder you can
see we have a folder here named as
images and we have an image present
inside this particular folder right so
what we have to do is we have to provide
this path inside a HTML file so what we
are going to do here is we are going to
get back to vs code and inside here
we'll write images so this is our folder
name and we have a file named html.png
present inside the that particular fold
so SRC is the attribute and this
particular thing is the value of a
attribute right now the next thing we
are going to do here is we are going to
write here alt now inside this alt let's
say we are writing HTML over here now
this alt attribute is used when we add
an image on so basically what happens is
when we add an image to a web browser
sometimes what happens is the image is
not shown over the browser so in that
case the alternate text will be shown so
if this particular image is not shown in
the browser then this particular text
will be shown so let's save this program
we'll open a web browser here side by
side as well you can see that this
particular image is present over here in
a web browser the size of this image is
quite large we can change the size in
two different ways we can either use the
ID attribute here as well and then use
that particular attribute in The Styling
tag or css file to change the size of
this image or we can simply use the
height and width attribute in the image
tag over here so that's the simple one
so what we are going to do is we are
going to write here height height is an
attribute we have to define the height
in pixels so we have written over here
300 pixels save the program and you can
see the height of this image is 300
pixels same thing goes for width as well
if we write here width and if we Define
the width as 300 pixels as we save the
program and you can see now the height
and width of this particular image is
300 pixels right so guys this is all
about the basics of attributes in HTML I
hope you guys understood this we'll go
through each attribute while working on
those attributes in the upcoming videos
so don't worry about it if we haven't
covered all the attributes over here
we'll go through them in the upcoming
videos before we move on and discuss the
different formatting tags in HTML let's
understand what formatting is formatting
refers to the process of making the text
present on web page more appealing to
the user for example let's say we want
to add a heading in a HTML document and
for that we want a specific font size
let's say we want to add a heading with
a bigger font size for this purpose we
have the heading tag present in HTML
which provides us with six different
font sizes with H1 being the tag with
the greatest font size and H6 with the
smallest R we have already discussed in
in the previous videos as well now we
need to make sure which font size we
want and we can use the heading tag
accordingly let's understand this with
the help of an example let's suppose we
are working on a web page wherein we
want a heading so let's say the heading
is what is HTML we want the font size to
be bigger so simply we'll write here H1
we have already mentioned it that H1 has
the biggest font size of all the six
heading tags right so inside this we'll
write what is is HTML so let's suppose
this is the heading now on saving the
program you can see here on the browser
that we have a heading with larger font
size so what we can do for now is we'll
remove this heading from here now save
it and you can see we have only one
heading as of now we have the heading as
what is HTML we can also write a
paragraph after this heading tag that
will explain what HTML is using the
paragraph so let's do it over here as
well and you guys will understand it
much better so here we are going to use
the break element so this is basically
an empty element used in HTML for line
break so what we are going to do is we
are going to put it over here so this is
the tag BR tag or Break Tag we can say
now what we are going to do is we are
going to write here inside the paragraph
tag HTML stands
for let's write it in capitals we'll
write here hyper text
markup language
fine so here we have paragraph that says
HTML stands for hypertext markup
language now what we want to do is we
want to add another heading to this web
page which will Define the uses of HTML
so basically what we are doing is we are
going through the sizes of heading text
so we want another heading let's say
over here now the main heading of our
web page was what is HTML and we want
wanted to stand out among all the
headings present in our web page that's
why we use the H1 tag for that heading
now for the next heading or for the new
heading we have a little bit smaller
size than the main heading so what we
are going to do is we are going to use
the h2 tag or the H3 tag for that so
let's use the H3 tag for now we'll write
over here
H3 so basically we are going to write it
after a br tag so we are going to use
the BR tag over here or The Brak tag we
can say now we are going to write here
uses of HTML fine now save the program
and you guys can clearly see the
difference in font size of both the
headings let me zoom in a bit here in
the browser so now you guys can see it
much better the there's a difference in
the size of heading one and heading
three right so this difference is what
we are talking about there are six
different sizes for a heading tag in
HTML we can use any of these heading
tags according to our need figure out
which one of these six tags is best
suitable for your web page and use them
simple and easy let's move ahead and
we'll now discuss some more formatting
tags present in HTML let's move ahead
and we'll now discuss some more
formatting tags present in HTML the next
tag we are going to discuss is the Bold
tag this tag is used to make the text
bold or strong so there are two
different tags for the same task for
making the text bold we can either use
the bold tag or simple B tag we can say
the other tag we can use is the strong
tag the functionality of both tags is
similar so we'll use them side by side
so that you guys can see the difference
or they are basically same so what we
are going to do is we are going to write
here after this BR TCH we are going to
write here B so b stand for bold TCH now
we are going to write something in here
so let's say we are writing over here
HTML now again after BR tag we are going
to use the strong tag fine we'll write
same thing here the content will remain
the same so we are going to write HTML
over
here now here we used both tags with
similar content present inside the save
the program and you can see we have two
similar outputs here on our web page the
outputs are exactly similar the working
of both the tags is the same right now
let's recall the nesting of elements in
HTML from the previous video we have
said earlier that we can use an element
within a another element in HTML we are
going to Nest this bold tag inside a
first paragraph tag it means that we are
going to Nest this bold tag over here so
what we are going to do is we are going
to use bold tag inside the full form or
we are going to put the full form of
HTML inside the Bold tag fine so save it
and you can see we have hypertext markup
language written over here in the
browser in in bold right it looks better
than the previous one just like the Bold
tag we have two more tags present in
HTML to make the text on screen look
more appealing to the user the italic
tag and the underlined now you guys must
be thinking that these three formatting
techniques are also present in Microsoft
Word you are right these three tags are
present in both msword and HTM the
working is also same so let's use these
tags here once what we are going to do
is we are going to use this tags over
here only so we are going to put this
hyper text markup language inside three
different tags so we are going to put
them inside italic we are going to put
them inside bold and we are going to put
them inside underline as so we are going
to do this over
here now you can see the nesting of
elements over here if I zoom in a bit on
Visual Studio code you can see we have a
paragraph tag then we have three tags
present inside so we have bold Tech we
have italic and underline so this is
called nesting of elements now save this
program and you can see the text over
here we have hyper text markup language
in italics it is underlined and it is
bold in Niche right the next tag we are
going to use is the delete tag we have
two different tags present for this task
as well let's say we want to put a line
through the center of any text Crossing
it out basically let's say that this
text is is not relevant fine so let's go
through an example first what we are
going to do is we are going to use the
break tag over here and now after this
Break Tag we are going to use a
paragraph tag we are going to write a
paragraph
so let's say We'll right here I would
like to have a cup
of
okay cup
off cough fine save it and you you can
see we have this paragraph or sentence
over here on the browser now what we
want is we want to delete this
particular word or we can say we want to
put a line through it fine so what we
are going to do is we are going to write
here
strike fine we are going to put coffee
inside this strike tag because we want
this particular word to cut and then
let's say we are writing over here T
fine so save it now and you can see it
over here it says I would like to have a
cup of coffee has a line over it and
then we have written tea so you guys can
understand the meaning of this sentence
by yourself I guess can use this tag
anywhere according to our needs we can
achieve this same thing with the help of
the delete tag as well what we have to
do is we have to write here in place of
strike what we are going to do is we are
going to copy this piece of code from
here we are going to paste it here now
in instead of strike we are going to
write here delete so D this is the
tech and we are going to close this tag
as well now we are going to write coffee
inside it and save the program and you
can see we have the exact same output
with this tag as well fine another tag
we have in HTML for formatting is the
mark tag now the mark tag in HTML is
used to Mark any particular text the
text will be highlighted with yellow
color for example let's say we are
writing something over here or we can
just paste this again and we are going
to remove this part now we want to Mark
the word coffee let's say so what we are
going to do is we are going to write
here mark this is the tag and inside
this tag we are going to write coffee
let's say fine save the program and you
can see it over here we have this
sentence which says I would like to have
a cup of coffee and coffee is
highlighted over here right so this is
the mark tag and we can use this tag for
formatting now the last tag we are going
to discuss in today's video is the font
tag the font is an inline element used
to change font sizes font colors and
font styles of the text in a web page
this element has its own attributes so
the three attributes we can use are size
color and phas fine size is used to
change the font size of the text we can
write values between 1 and seven with
one being the smallest and seven being
the largest form exactly opposite to The
Heading Tex so you can learn it that way
color refers to the font color we can
simply write the name of the color or we
can use the hexadecimal values for
colors the hexadecimal numbers are
specified according to the RGB value for
each
color the last thing we have is face
face refers to the font style the
default HTML font is times new room we
can use any font style of our choice
using this attribute so let's use this
tag over here and you guys will
understand it much better I guess so
what we'll do is we'll write
here let's say we are using a paragraph
tag so we'll write something over here
let's say I
prefer now we are going to use the font
tag over here so this is a tag you can
see it in red color now we have three
different attributes right so the first
attribute we have is size so we'll write
here inside size let's say the size of
this font is four then we have color so
color defines the font color so let's
say the font color we want is red and
then we have the face so let's say we
want the font style to
be Wana and we'll
write something over here let's say we
are writing this over over red fine now
save the program and you can see it over
here it says I prefer red fine so let's
complete this sentence what we are going
to do is we are going to write something
after this font tag as well so let's say
we are writing over here red over blue
save the program and you can see it over
here that we have this particular
sentence which says I prefer red over so
let me increase the size of vs code so
that you guys can see it clearly so here
you can see we have this paragraph tag
then we have written inside it I prefer
and we have kept this red word inside a
particular element font element
basically this font element has three
different attributes size color and
phase now let's change the size of this
to six for
now and
we'll check the output save the program
and you can see red over here is quite
large in size right it looks different
so I hope you guys got this formatting
an HTML document is mostly done using
CSS but now HTML also allows us to
format our documents using different
tags basic formatting we can say so
formatting is making the web page more
appealing using these particular tags so
the list of formatting tags present in
HTML is quite long we can't discuss all
of them here but if you use any of those
tags in the upcoming videos then surely
we'll discuss them over there on now the
task for you guys is to use these
formatting tags and let us know if you
find any difficulty in using them in
HTML a phrase tag is used to give
structural meaning to a block of text
what does that mean let's try to
understand this with the help of an
example we'll first take a paragraph for
this example a small one maybe so let's
do it here what we'll do is we'll write
here P so we are going to use the
paragraph T let's write something over
here so let's say we are writing over
here hello everyone then I'll write this
is Cal and let's suppose we are writing
over
here please subscribe to
a YouTube channel
fine save this and you can see here that
we have the same paragraph here on the
browser now what we said earlier about
the phrase tags is they are used to give
structural meaning to a block of text
right so here we have a paragraph and we
want to provide meaning to a block of
text let's say we want to put some
emphasis on the word YouTube over here
fine we want this word to stand out
differently from the rest of the
paragraph for this task we have the
emphasized tag in
HTM the Syntax for this tag goes like
this so what we'll do is we'll cut this
sentence into two different parts so
that it will be easy for you guys to
understand now we have the emphasized
tag in HTML the syntax is pretty simple
what we have to do is we'll write over
here so we are going to make changes
inside this particular paragraph tag
only so we are going to use the emphasis
tag over here so what we have to do is
we have to cut the word YouTube from
here and we have to paste it here now
the syntax is so simple we have a two
word tag so it says em it stands for
emphasis now save the program and you
can see here in the browser you can see
the difference basically the word
YouTube stands out from the rest of the
words present in the paragraph to lay
some more emphasis on the word YouTube
we can use the title attribute now title
attribute will be used inside the
emphasis tag so let's do it here once so
what we are going to do is we are going
to use the title attribute over here so
let's say the title says check a
YouTube channel fine so let's break it a
little
more so here you can see we have these
three lines so inside this paragraph tag
what we are doing
is we are using the emphasis tag and
inside that emphasis tag we are using
the title attribute fine on saving the
program you can see nothing changes over
here on the browser to witness the
change here we have have to take our
mouse cursor over YouTube and you can
see we have a small popup here that
contains the value of a title attribute
let me zoom in a bit here so here you
can see on taking the mouse cursor we
have this small popup with the value of
a title letter right another thing we
can do for this task is we can add a
link over here on the word YouTube we'll
discuss it in the upcoming videos when
we'll go through text links in HTML so
you guys will understand it much better
then now you guys may have a question in
your mind that we can do this exact same
thing with formatting tags as well right
yes of course we can do that but
formatting refers to the process of
molding the text for a better look and
feel of the text while phrase tags are
used to provide meaning to a block of
text it's not necessary that if a tag
falls under the category of formatting
text then it can't be a phrase tag the
difference lies in the purpose of using
that particular tag I hope you guys are
getting
the next tag we are going to discuss is
the mark tag we have already discussed
this tag in the formatting tags as well
so let's discuss it one more time the
mark tag in HTML is used to Mark any
particular text the text will be
highlighted with yellow color so we have
discussed it previously now what we are
going to do is we are going to copy this
piece of code so we are going to copy
the whole paragraph from here and then
we'll paste it here now instead of using
the emphasis tag we are going to use the
mark tag over here fine so we are going
to change the tag name from emphasis to
mark for the opening and closing tag
save it now and you can see we have
another paragraph over here which is
almost the same or which is exactly the
same it says hello everyone this is
kosel please subscribe to our YouTube
channel now the thing to notice here is
the word YouTube it is highlighted in
yellow color right so the title
attribute will work same over here as
well if you put a mouse cursor over the
word YouTube you can see we have this
popup with the same title value right so
one thing to notice here is the title
attribute is basically the
differentiator between the formatting
tags and the phrase tags it means that
the tag Remains the Same but the way of
using it defines the purpose so let's
move ahead and we'll now discuss the
abbreviation tag in HTML the word
abbreviation in general terms refers to
the short form of a word
that's it we have the answer here if
you're using any abbrevation for any
word we want the user to know that this
particular word has a special meaning
then we can use the abbreviation T so
the syntax goes like this what we'll do
is we'll again use the same
paragraph and
we'll paste it over here
again so what we are going to do
is we are going to remove this empty
space from here so that you guys will be
able to see the whole code or as much
code as possible so what we are going to
do now is we are going to use the
abbreviation tab fine so we'll remove
this piece of code from here we have to
put this over the word YouTube so what
we are going to do is we are going to
write here abbreviation and inside there
we are going to write YT so this is the
short form of YouTube
basically now save the program and you
can see that we have another paragraph
but there's no difference over here as
of now the word is simple there's it's
not standing out basically right so this
is because while using the abbrevation
tag we must necessarily use the title
attribute along with this tag so let's
do it here we have to write here title
and we have to write Here YouTube
because YT stands for YouTube so we are
going to write Here
YouTube now save the program and you can
see here that the
YT is now underlined with a dotted line
fine this indicates that the word YT is
used as an abbreviation here and the
user will know that something is
different over here on taking the mouse
cursor over it you can see we have the
value of a title attribute you can see
it says YouTube so this is basically the
short form of YouTube YT over here now
the next tag we are going to discuss is
the address tag this tag is used to
display the address in the web browser
the content is written Within the
opening and closing address tag is
considered as an address in HTML so this
is the address we generally use fine not
an IP address or nothing else the
general address we use for our location
or for a address so let's use this tag
over here we'll write
here address and this is the tag now
inside this tag we are going to
write YouTube office let's
say then we have
1 2
3 street so this is going to be the
street name for a address then we have
let's say sector so let's say the sector
is
456 and then we
have the place name is NOA and the
country name is India
fine so this is an address and let's
save the program you can see here the
difference in the browser the address
tag over here has a different font this
tag is used to indicate that this
particular block of text is an address
so you can see it over here this is a
address now if you want see it clearly
let me remove these three paragraphs
from here save the program now and you
can see we have address over here so if
you want to write it in different lines
so what we can do is we can use the
break tag over here then over here again
save the program and you can see we have
the address over here the font is
different that's the only difference
between address tag and other
tags the next tag we are going to
discuss is the short quotation tag this
tag is used to add double quotes within
a sentence the syntax is simple so what
we'll do is we'll write something over
here let's say we are writing over here
paragraph We are writing over here let's
say again
please subscribe to a
now we want the word YouTube inside
double quotes right so for that we are
going to use the quotation tag this is
the syntax we have to write simple CU
and we have to put the word YouTube
inside it andine then we'll write
here Channel and we have to put a space
over here save the program and you can
see it says please subscribe to our
YouTube channel with YouTube present
inside double codes
fine so the last tag we are going to
discuss in today's tutorial is the code
tag in HTML this tag is used to
represent programming code in HTML the
text will look like we have any code
from a programming language for example
we'll write here code this is the tag
now inside there we'll write let's say
we are using a for Loop in JavaScript so
we'll write here for I is equals to
0 then we
have I less
than three so let's give some spaces
over here and then we have
i++ fine then after this we have inside
here
console.log and we are going to print
high fine so if you new to this language
just ignore it it's just a simple piece
of code from JavaScript so save it now
and you can see we have this code over
here now what we going to do next is we
are going to use Break Tag over here
first then
we'll understand it fine so we are going
to use the BR tag here again and here
again fine save it now and you can see
the code
now you can see we have the same output
on the browser as the text present in vs
code the font is exactly the same so
this represents a piece of code in HTML
we can use the code tag for that so Guys
these are some of the basic phrase tags
we discussed in today's video as we
mentioned earlier that the list is quite
long for all these texts we'll discuss
them in future whenever we use them I
hope you guys got it till now we have
covered different types of tags present
in HTML we came across the formatting
tags and the phrase tags present in HTM
in the last part we also covered the
differences between these tags apart
from all the differences these tags are
they are still similar in one aspect
that is these tags are used to change
the appearance of a web page whenever we
use these tags we change the look and
the feel of a web page now the meta tag
is a bit different from these tags this
tag does not impact the appearance of a
web page it is used in the head section
of the HTML document and does not
require any closing tag to
work what this tag does is it give
information about the data we have on
our web page meta refers to metadata
metadata means data about data for
example if we have a website that
provides the user with some data it can
be any kind of data and the user can go
through it to gain some information but
the information about the data present
on a website is given by metadata
only what does it mean to provide data
about data for example if you go to
Google and search for a keyword now how
Google works is it goes through the
keywords present in any particular
website and then shows the user that
particular website those keywords here
refer to metad data and we have to put
them inside meta tags in HTML the
description we get while searching for a
website is also present inside the meta
tag of any HTML
document basically what we are trying to
say is this tag is used to give
essential information about any
particular web page meta elements can be
used to include name value payers just
describing properties of HTML documents
for example if you want to put any
keyword for a web page the name
attribute inside the meta tag will
contain the keyword and the value
attribute will contain the actual
keyword
name there's no closing tag needed in
meta elements because these elements
contain information within attributes
only we can use multiple meta tags for
different information an interactive web
page cannot be created with just this
structure so you will employ aiding
Technologies like JavaScript and CSS to
bring interaction and Beauty to your
HTML
respectively that's where CSS comes into
picture making web page Pages attractive
is made easier with the help of CSS
often known as cascading style
sheets the style and experience of a web
page are handled by CSS the color of the
text the font style the spacing between
par graphs the size and arrangement of
columns the background pictures or
colors used layout designs differences
in display for various devices and
screen sizes and a variety of other
effects can all be controlled using one
single language which is CSS although
CSS is simple to grasp and learn it
offers strong control over how an HTML
document is presented to the user it
depends how you are presenting your HTML
document how you are styling it because
the user will get an impression on the
first view
itself CSS is most frequently used in
association with HTML or xhtml as markup
languages now when it comes to front-end
web development of any web page the
three most widely used Technologies are
HTML CSS and
JavaScript HTML is used to create the
structure of a web page CSS makes it
look more attractive to the user by
adding styles to it and JavaScript adds
interactivity to the web page so let's
move ahead and now we'll discuss the
advantages of using
CSS the first one is timesaving CSS is a
time-saving since you can create it once
and reuse it across a number of HTML
Pages there's a style available for each
HTML document or we can say each HTML
element that you can select and apply to
as many different websites as you desire
if you utilize CSS instead of manually
writing HTML tag attributes each time
Pages load faster you can only you only
need to create one CSS rule per tag and
it will be applied to every instance of
that element so quicker download times
results from less code simple
maintenance to make a modification that
affects all elements on all web pages
just modify the stylesheet everything
will update
instantly also CSS provides a great
range of characteristics than HTML so
that you can provide a considerably
better styling experience CSS provides a
considerably wider range of properties
as well than HTML so can you can give
your HTML page a much better look than
you can use using HTML attributes better
Styles than
HTML now stylesheets enable the material
to be optimized for multiple types of
devices allowing for multiple device
compatibility different versions of a
website can be displayed for printing or
for handheld device devices like pdas
and cell phones by using the same HTML
document so let's move ahead and now
we'll understand how CSS actually
works a browser must merge the content
of a document with its style information
before displaying it it goes through
several steps to process the document
which we have outlined you remember that
this is a greatly simplified explanation
because different browsers will perform
the procedure differently when a browser
loads a web page but this is what
usually takes place in a browser the
browser starts loading HTML example it
receives it from the network it
transform the HTML into a document
object model in the computer's memory
the document is represented by the
document object model in the same time
it also loads CSS as well most of the
resources that the HTML document links
to including embedded images videos and
even connected CSS are subsequentially
fetched by the browser because it is
handled a little later in the process we
are not discussing JavaScript here to
make things easier for you
guys the browser passes the CSS that was
fetched and groups the various rules
according to the type of selectors they
use such as element class ID and so on
it determines which rules should be
applied to which document object model
nodes based on the selectors it
discovers and applies the appropriate
styles to each node as needed this
immediate step is called render tree so
this is the creation of Dom tree after
the rules have been applied to it the
render tree is organized in the manner
in which it should look the screen
displays the pages visual repres
presentation this stage is called
painting So guys this is how CSS
actually works on web page I hope you
guys must have got an idea about what
CSS is and why one should use CSS on a
web page we'll dive deeper into all CSS
Concepts in the upcoming videos so we'll
go through all the CSS aspects one by
one CSS uses the color values to specify
the colors on a page they can be
specified using predefined color names
hex or RGB format the there are nearly
140 standard color names hexadecimal is
a six-digit representation of a color
the first two digits are represents a
red value the next two are green value
and the last is a blue value all the
other colors can be created using the
combination of these three colors there
are several websites available where you
can know the hex value of the different
shades of color as you can see the black
color is signified by hashtag and the 6
Z the red is hashtag FF and the four Zer
followed by it the RGB color value is
specified using the RGB property the
property takes three values one for red
green and blue the value can be the
integer between 0 to 225 or a percentage
as you can see the black color is
signified by 00 the red by 255 00 the
Blue by 00 255 and the green by
0255 now let's move to an example to
understand how we can add the colors to
our
page in this example we will see how we
can add colors in different ways to our
HTML so we are on the sublim text rator
as you can see we have the standard well
ready with an H2 and a paragraph on our
page open the style tag and make the
font size of the paragraph to 25 pixels
so it is clearly
visible let's start by adding colors to
our text just by color names HTML
supports nearly 140 standard color
names we'll make the color of the
paragraph green for that just type color
and set the color to
Green as you can see our paragraph is
changed to Green let's try one
more this time we will add the color
red just
refresh as you can see the color is not
changed to Red there are nearly 140 HTML
standard colors that is supported by the
web browser
you can also add colors using the RGB
format there are many websites available
to know the RGB or hex value of the
desired color one such as HTML
course.com as you can see in the HTML
course.com we have the hex value and the
RGB value of the desired color let's try
one we'll add this color with the RGB
value 171 229 and 27 2our paragraph So
for that just type RGB and the color
code you want
as you can see the color is not changed
to our RGB value let's try one
more this time we'll use this RGB value
to our text
you can see the color is changed to our
desired
value in this way you can use the RGB
format to change the
colors the next way is using the hex
values hex is a six digit representation
of a color the first two digits are red
next one two are green and the last are
the blue value let's see how you can use
the hex values
as you can see the hex value for this
color is # 31787 F we'll use this value
to our
text to add the hex value you have to
use the hashtag followed by the color
code you can see that color is changed
to our x value let's try one more
you can see the hex value for this color
is # F14
a07 just copy the desired value to your
file you can see the color
changes you can also add color borders
to our heading do that just mention the
Border style along with the color code
we'll add the Border color red to our
H2 now you can see we have the border
around our
H2 I hope you have understand how to use
the color values to your web page there
are mainly three ways by which you can
add the colors to your web page they are
Hax RGB values and the color names in
the last two sessions we have discussed
what is c CSS and the CSS color property
in this session we'll discuss how you
can set the background image on your web
page we'll see the several properties
related to background image and how you
can use them to customize the image
around the web page so without further
delay let's get going so let's begin by
discussing about the background property
of the
CSS the background image property
specifies an image to use as a
background of an element the background
is defined in the body element of the
HTM
code to add a background image on an
HTML element use the HTML style
attribute and the CSS background image
property and mention the path of the
image inside the URL attribute there are
several properties of the background
that are used to define the image on a
page some of the common ones are
background image background repeat and
background
position by default the image is
repeated so it covers the entire
element let's switch to the text lator
and see how we can add the background
image to our page so we are on the
Sublime Text trator let's start by
opening a style
tag the background image is always set
on the body tag so type body and open
the curly
braces the background image is always
set on the body tag so open the body
type with curly braces and start typing
background
image use the URL value of the
background image to set the path of the
image make sure the image is in the same
folder as of the HTML file here we have
our file natur 3.
jpj so mention the path inside the
double
codes save the file and let's see how it
looks on a web
page as you can see we have the image on
the web page let's format this image a
little bit we'll start by setting the
background size so type background
size and there are three values to the
background size first one is auto it
will set the image as it
is save the file and let's see how it
looks on a
page as you can see the size of the
image is as same of the original
size the col value will set the image
size that will be fit to the web
page as you can see the image is set to
the whole web page we can also set the
image size to manual let's let's say we
want the image size of width 500 pixels
so now as you can see the width of the
image is 500 pixels next we will set the
background repeat property there are
three values to background repeat first
is no repeat with the no repeat value
the images will not be repeated on a
page now as you can see the images are
not
repeated second is repeat X it will set
the images to be repeated on x-axis
as you can see the images are not
repeated on the x-axis similarly repeat
the images on the Y
AIS as you can see the images are not
repeated to the y- axis and there's a
default value repeat which will repeat
the images on the web
page so let's keep it to cover so let's
keep the background size to cover and
set the background repeat to no repeat
let's save the file and look it on a web
page now as you can see the image is
fully fit to the web
page let's add a text above our image to
see how it looks like so I'll add a
paragraph tag and type some random text
here
let's set the text color to red and
align it to
Center I'll type P and open the curly
braces I'll set the color to
red and I'll set the text align to
Center
let's save the file and see how it looks
on a
page as you can see we have a text above
our image which is centrally aligned and
the text color is red in this video you
will learn what are CSS selectors and
what are their different types so let's
start by discussing the agenda for this
tutorial so in this tutorial we will
learn what are CSS selectors and what
are their different types we will also
look at an examples to how to work with
CSS selectors so what are CSS
selectors CSS selectors allow you to
select and style HTML elements selectors
are used to find elements based on their
ID classes types attributes value of
attributes and much more let's discuss
the most common selectors there are
several different types of CSS selectors
the most common of them are CSS element
selectors CSS ID selector CSS class
selector CSS Universal selector and CSS
group selectors so what is a CSS element
selector the element selector selects
element based on the element name this
is a CSS selector it means it will
select all the P elements on the page it
will style all the P elements to the
central aligned having blue color this
is a CSS selector it is set to P this
means it will select all the P elements
on the page it will style all the P
elements to be Center aligned having
blue color let's look at what it looks
on a
page so as you can see all the elements
are centrally aligned with a text color
blue CSS ID selector the ID selector
uses the ID attribute of an HTML element
to find a specific element an ID should
be unique within the page so you should
use the ID selector to find a single
unique element to find an element within
a specific ID use a hash character
followed by the ID of the
element so here we have used the hash
paravan so all the rule will be applied
to the HTML element with ID equal to par
one so this is an ID selector it will be
applied to all the HML element with ID
is equal to Paran as you can see it is
applied to the element having the ID
Paran and all the other elements are
defaultly styled CSS class selector the
class selector finds the element with a
specific class set by the HTML class
attribute to select an HTML with a
specific class use a period character
followed by the name of the class so
this style will be applied to all the
elements having the class name class one
this is a class selector it is denoted
by a period symbol all the elements
having a class named class one will be
styled with centrally aligned and color
blue as you can see the element having
the class name class one is styled and
all the other elements are set to
default CSS Universal
selector the universal selector selects
all the elements on a page the universal
selector is assigned by a star character
the universal selector selects all the
elements on a stylesheet as you can see
it is denoted by a star Mark all the
elements inside a web page will be
centrally aligned and the color will be
set to blue as you can see all the
elements are centrally aligned and the
colors are set to Blue CSS group
selector in stylesheets there are often
elements using the same style to
minimize the code you can group
selectors to group The selectors
separate each selectors with a comma
here we have group selectors for H1 H2
and P so style is applied to H1 H2 and P
elements only it is better to group The
selectors to minimize the code here we
have group selectors P H2 and H3 so
style will be applied to only elements
having P H2 and H3 as you can see so all
the elements of P H2 and H3 are
centrally aligned and colored to
Red every element that can be displayed
on a web page is comprised of one or
more rectangular boxes CSS Box model
typically describes how these
rectangular boxes are laid out on a web
page these boxes can have different
properties and can interact with each
other in different phas but every box
has a Content area and optional
surrounding padding border and margin
areas the following diagram demonstrates
how the content padding border and
margin CSS properties determine how much
space an element can take on a web page
the content area consists of content
like text images or other media it is
bounded by the content Edge and its
dimensions are given by the content box
width and
height the Border area is the area
between the Box padding and margin its
dimensions are given by the width and
height of the Border
the margin area consists of spaces
between the border and the margin the
dimensions of the margin area are the
margin box width and margin box height
it is useful to separate the element
from its
neighbors the padding area is the
area that includes the elements padding
this area is actually the space around
the content area and within the Border
box it dimensions are given by the width
of the padding box and the height of the
padding
box now let's jump to an example to
understand the Box model better so we
are on the sublim texor to get started I
have created a box named simply run
background color pink the font size is
30 pixel and we have set the border to
zero solid green let's see how it looks
on our
page so as you can see we have a box
named simply learn with background going
all the way to the end I have also
removed all the padding and margin from
the page so that the boxes are pushed
just at the corner of the page as you
can see
let's start by adding a padding of 20
pixel to the
box if you save the file you can see the
Box increased by 20 pixel from all the
sides padic URS inside the background of
an element it goes around the content of
the element most of the buttons inside
the CSS designed using padding so that
the background of the button becomes
wider than the actual text the next
thing we can do is change the border of
the element if you change this border
size to 15 pixel we will get a nice
solid background of color
green the Border goes around the padding
of our element so we have the 20 pixel
of padding around our content and 15
pixel of border around the padding which
is around the
content now we'll see the working of the
margin if you add 30 pixel of margin to
our element you can see the spacing on
the outside of our
border so let's add the 30 pixel margin
and
refresh you can see the spacing on
outside of the Border margin is used to
space two elements apart from each other
now let's change these values to see the
difference let's make the margin 40
pixels we'll make the padding 30 pixels
and let's keep the Border 20 pixels and
make it color
red This is 40
pixels let's observe the
changes so as you can see our border now
has a red background the padding is 30
pixel the margin is 40 pixel let's
inspect the elements to understand it
better
by clicking on inspect you can see the
different styles here in the computer
tab you can see the Box model this is
your content area uh this is the padding
area this is the border and this is the
margin area we have the margin of 40
pixels around the border so you can when
you click on this area you can see the
margin get highlighted the B area gets
highlighted of 20 pixels this is the
padding and this is the content you can
change the size of the content by adding
the height and width so let's try adding
height and width we'll give the height
50 pixels and we'll give the width also
50
pixels just save the
file now when you refresh you can see
the content area 50 into
50 what is a
flexbox flexbox also called flexible Box
model is basically a layout mode mode or
model that provides an easy and clean
way to arrange the items within a
container if you are using a CSS for a
while you must have used the old block
model where you assign width in terms of
percentage or fixed width and then use
the float to arrange the items on the
page suppose for example you want to
earn three boxes in a row then you have
to enter everything manually from width
height and to padding flexbox can do all
these things with ease
some of the concepts of flexible Box
model is the ability to alter the item
width and height to best fit in the
containers available in the free
space flex model is Direction agnostic
which is different from the Box model
which is vertically biased and the
inline which is horizontally biased
flexbox works for
both flexbox is more effective than
small scale
layouts so here are the main properties
of the flex
okay so let's jump to some code and
learn how these Flex properties work
okay so we are on the sublim text trator
to get started let's add a div inside a
body here and we'll give a class of
flexbox container since this will be the
container where all our flexbox item
will reside
then inside this container we will add
another div and give it a class flexbox
item and one more class flexbox item one
which will help us to understand which
items we are referring to when we style
our elements
individually let's just save the file
and see how it looks on a page now if
you save the file you can see we have
the box because I have already applied
some of the styles to these flexbox
items let's just see The
Styling so you can see we have the items
styled just a basic styling so that we
get the box on the web
page now let's just copy these and add
two more flexbox items and you will see
we have two more boxes on our page
just copy and paste them
below give them the class name flexbox
item 2 and flexbox item 3 just save the
file now you can see we have three boxes
on the
page now to create a flex container we
will add display Flex to our Flex
container and this is how we create
create a flex box
container so here we will just add
display
Flex just save the
file now you can see all the items are
in the same height and they're all in
the same row you will also notice that
if we shrink our browser the items
adjust themselves accordingly to fit
within the
browser now if you want to style the
elements on the main axis we will use
the property justify content inside a
flexbox container let's make it a
center save the
file now you can see that all the
elements are in the center of the page
another thing we can do is if we want
our layout to have a spaces between the
elements we will set the justify content
to space between
you can see all the items are now evenly
spaced if you want to lay out your items
on the cross axis we would use the Align
items property the default value for
this is stretch if we want to keep the
size of our items we will use the center
and then all our items will be Center
vertically before flexbox aligning the
items vertically inside the container
was nearly impossible with flexbox you
can do it easily
now you can see the items are aligned
vertically inside the container now
let's just delete everything and we just
keep the display
Flex now if we want to have a column
layout instead we will use the flex
direction and change it to column Flex
Direction column now if you refresh the
page you will see all the items are
shown up in a
column now we can start talking about
the different properties that can be
applied to our different flexbox items
as opposed to flexbox container items
the flexbox container is only for laying
out and spacing between your items as
well as the positioning of your item
inside the container the actual flexbox
item properties are used to override
those item Properties or to apply
different sizing to these element now if
we want our first item that it does not
shrink when we shrink our browser we'll
set the flex shrink to zero to our first
item so we'll set the flex shrink to
zero now if you go back to the
page and try to shrink
this you'll see the first item Remains
the Same it does not
shrink now in the same way you can set
the items to grow in proportion with the
web browser suppose we want a flex box
item to to grow with the as the page
grow and cover all the empty spaces so
we'll set this Flex grow to
one now you will see the all this empty
spaces are taken by the second item
let's say we want a second box to be at
the center of the container instead of
stretching to full height we can use the
Align self property and set it to
center now you will see that the Align
self property overrides the Align
content property of the
container you can see it is centrally
aligned
so this is all you need to understand
and get started to work with the flex
boxes I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and learned something new about the flex
boox and how you can use the flex boox
to create the dynamic layout for your
slide what is a
grid a grid is a set of intersecting
horizontal and vertical lines defining
the rows and
columns and what is a grid layout so CSS
grid layout is the most powerful layout
system available in CSS it is a
two-dimensional system meaning it can
handle both columns and rows unlike
flexbox which is largely a
one-dimensional
system you work with grid layout by
applying the CSS rules to both the
parent element which became the grid
container and the element's children
which become the grid
items the CSS grid layout excels at
dividing a page into major regions or
defining the relationship in terms of
size position and layer between parts of
a control built HTML Primitives
you can see this is the basic layout of
a grid system like tables grid layout
enables an author to align elements into
columns and rows however many more
regular layouts are either possible or
easier with CSS grid than they were with
tables for example a grid container
child element could position themselves
so they actually overlap and layer
similar to the CSS positioned
elements so here are the features of the
CSS grid layout they are fixed and have
flexible track sizes you can create a
grid with fixed track sizes using pixels
for example this sets the grid to the
specified pixel which fits to the layout
you desire you can also create a grid
using flexible sizes with percentages
with the new F unit designed for this
purpose you can place the items into a
precise location using the grid line
numbers names or by targeting an area of
the grid the grid also contains
algorithm to control the placement of
items not given an explicit position on
the
grid you can define an explicit grid
with a grid layout the grid layout
specification is a flexible enough to
add additional rows and columns when
needed features such as adding as many
columns that will fit into a container
are
included it also gives you control of
overlapping content more than one item
can be placed into a grid cell or area
and they can partially overlap each
other this layering May then be
controlled with the Z index
property so here are the basic
terminologies you should know to work
with the grid system
better the grid line is the dividing
line that make up the structure of the
grid they can either be vertical or
horizontal and decides on either side of
row and
columns a grid column is a space between
two adjacent vertical grid lines the
size of a grid column is determined by
the grid template columns property on
the other hand a grid row is a space
between two adjacent horizontal grid
lines its size is determined by the grid
template rows
property the grid cell is the single
unit of a CSS
grid and in Grid design a gutter is
basically the width of the space between
columns a gutter margin is the white
space formed by the adjoining inside
margins of two facing pages in a book or
a space between columns on a page so
with this let's now move on to the
Hands-On demo and see how the grd system
works in actual world if getting your
learning started is half the battle what
if you could do that for free visit
skillup by simply learn click on the
link in the description to know more so
we are on the sublim text editor open
with a project with some basic
background Styles and nothing inside the
body you can see this is the basic
background style we have pre-applied
just to have a good look of the Box
model we'll start by creating a
container and wrapping our grid items in
it so let's create a grid and give it a
class named grid
container and inside of it we'll put our
different grid items so we'll just
create different grid items and give
them a class grid item followed by a
class number they belong to so that we
can easily distinguish between them
just copy paste this five times so we'll
have the five elements on our page
let's save the file and see how it looks
on the
page so you can see we have the
different grid items on the screen so
that it's easy for us to visualize we
have not applied any styles to them
other than the visual styles
so we'll go back to our
code let's go back to the CSS styling
sheet so to create the grid we'll open
our stylesheet we need to display grid
on our grid container so we select our
grid container and set the display to
grid if you save
now you will see nothing changes this is
because the grid itself doesn't Define
any rows and columns for us to work with
it just they give the alignment properly
therefore by default it looks just
exactly the same to make the grid look
actually grid what you need to do is
Define columns and rows for a
grid so to do this you will use a set
grid template and set the column if you
want to set the size of the column uh
we'll set the size to 100 pixel and 150
pixel
now if you refresh you have the 100
pixel column on the left and a 150 pixel
column on the right and then the grid
captures our next
row but what if we want our box to
flexible size themselves according to
the items inside of them here we'll use
a fraction unit instead in of 150 pixel
column we want one fraction of our size
and instead of 100 pixel we want the two
fractions of our size so we'll just
replace with two
fractions and this with one
fraction now if you save the file and go
back to the
page you will see the items on our left
here in our first column are twice as
large as the item on the second column
and that because of the F units we have
defined you can see the difference in
the sizes the item one is the twice of
the size of the item
two another thing you can do is with
columns is use repeat suppose you want
four Columns of a size 100 pixel wide
you can just write repeat command and
inside of it how many times you want to
repeat the
size so we'll just delete
this and use the
repeat we'll set the number of times we
want to repeat and the size of
the
columns now if you save the file you
will see we have a four columns 100
pixel wide we can do the same things for
row just set the grid template rows and
Define the size you
want now you can see we have the
symmetric size all around our container
if you don't know how large your grid is
going to be you can use the grid Auto
rows and this will determine the size of
all the rows that is added after the
template rows suppose we want all our
rows to be 100
pixels so we'll just delete the grid
template
rows and set the grid Auto rows to 100
pixel
now you can see all the rows are now 100
pixel
tall let's change our column back to 100
pixel and 150
pixels so that it will be easier for us
further
we'll just delete this grid Auto
rows now we'll talk about the spacing of
the rows and columns apart from each
other we can do this with the help of
the grid grab property grid row Gap will
give some spaces between the rows
similarly the grid column will give you
the spaces between the columns
now you can see the gaps between the
rows and columns now if we want the same
value for both The Columns you can use
the grid grab property and mention the
space we'll just delete this two
and instead of it we will use just the
grid
Gap and set the size to 20
pixel now you can see the evenly spaces
between the rows and the
columns this is all you need to know
about the sizing of the different
columns and rows now let's talk about
the positioning items within its GD
cells so for horizontal positioning we
could use the justify items and we can
set that to Center
so that centers each item within the
cell by default it is set to stretch we
can also set it to
start or
end or space around
we will leave this to
Center to vertically position the
content we could use the Align
items the Ali items also accept the same
values we can set it to Center
enter we can also set this one to start
or
end just we'll keep this to Center as
well you can also the entire grid within
the
container so let's get rid of these to
just demonstrate them in a proper
manner we could use a justifi content
and that will align the content
horizontally within the
container we can also set this to start
or to end
just set this back to
Center to align the content vertically
we could use the Align content and the
aligned content also accepts the same
value we can set it to Center
or
start if you inspect the
elements you can see there are align
centrally between the container we'll
just close this
okay so this is everything you need to
know to get started with the grid layout
grid works very similar to the flex boox
but it allows you too much in terms of
laying your elements because of its 2D
nature here you can see we already have
the HTML file with us in this video
tutorial we are going to create the
structure of a form with the help of
HTML and then we are going to style it
with the help of
CSS so before we begin with the
programming part let's discuss what is a
form basically forms are very essential
part of any website it is a way to take
users input and process the data
acquired from the user the form offers
controls for almost every use of an
application with the help of form
controls and several form fields we can
take small as well as large input data
from the user and then we can use that
data you guys must have seen it in
different websites where we have login
and sign up forms so in login form what
we usually do is we enter a email and a
password or a mobile number and a
password a combination of any of them
and then the website allows us to open a
account on for that particular website
on the other hand on a signup form we
need different type of data we need name
with then we have to put a age and
several other form of data right like
the phone number email everything we
have to put in a registration form so
these are the types of registration form
we usually see but apart from that we
can create other forms as well so let's
discuss why CSS is necessary to create a
form as we all know HTML is used to
structure a web page so with the help of
HTML we can create a form but to make
the form look more interactive to the
user we need to style it that's where
CSS comes into picture CSS is used to
style a form and it will make a form
look more interactive to the user as
well so without any further delay let's
start with the programming part and
we'll create a basic form with the help
of HT ML and CSS in this video so don't
worry we'll create some more forms in
the upcoming videos so we'll in this
particular video we'll see how CSS is
used along with the form so here you can
see we are in the HTML part of a form so
we'll create a form first so the most
basic element HTML element to create a
form is the form element now we are
going to take some unordered list or the
UL element now we are going to Pi the LI
so you as you guys all know UL and Li
both elements are used in combination
always so let's label the form so we'll
write label for we'll take certain
parameters and we'll write here name
fine this is going to be the name we'll
write your name save it and just refresh
the page so here you can see we have the
name present on a web browser so the
next thing we are going to do is we are
going to create some more input Fields
right so to create an input field we
have to use the input element always so
we'll write here input we have to Define
type type is going to be text and then
we have to put a name name is going to
be ID so ID is going to be the name and
then we'll write here usern name fine so
here you can see we have an input box
let me just increase the size a bit so
here you can see we have a input box
with name as the label and then we have
an input box so similarly we'll create
some more input elements first so we'll
just paste them here for four times so
you can see we have four different
placeholders so just let's just remove
this one and we are going to keep it
simple for this particular video so
we'll write here label for mail then we
are going to take email from the user so
we'll write here email and input type is
equals to we'll write here
email ID will also so mention
as mail let's say and name we are going
to write here use the email fine so save
it here you can see now we are going to
do the same for another one so here what
we'll do is we'll write here message so
we are going
to label this as message we are creating
another input field so we'll write here
input type is equals to okay just let's
just do one thing let's just remove this
input tag from here and we are going to
use the text area in place of it so
we'll write here text area ID as let's
say message and then we have to write
here
name user underscore message
fine close it and the text area is done
so here you can see we have a text area
as well we have two input fields and a
text area so we are going to create a
form out of it fine so we have all the
HTML elements now what we are going to
do is we are going to create a we are
going to style this form basically so
before that let me just create a button
as
well okay so we'll write
here button type is equals to
submit and we'll write here submit fine
save it and here you can see we have a
button as well so let's move to the CSS
part of this form now so what we are
going to do is we are going to style
this form with the help of CSS now we
already have the structure of a form so
to style this form we are going to use
certain IDs or we can say elements name
or whatever we want to use we can just
use them so first of all we are going to
Center the form on the web page so we
are going to let me just show you in
this way so here you can see we have all
the HTML elements present on the left
side of our web page so we are going to
Center them first so we are going to put
them here for that we are going to use
basic CSS so we'll write over here
margin margin is going to be zero and
auto zero for up and down Auto for left
and right so then we are going to write
here width the actual width of our form
so let's say the actual width is going
to be 400 pixel then we'll write here
pedding pedding we are going to write as
1M and then we'll write here border
border is going to be 1 pixel solid and
let's use any color for this form so
let's just write here
this save it so here you can see we have
a border the border of our form so here
you can see our form is present at the
center of our web page it looks
different from what we had in our HTML
part right so we have a border the all
the elements are present at the center
let's style it more then we are going to
define the Border radius border radius
is going to be let's say 1
M save it and and here you can see the
curved border and we'll write here
background color background color give
any let's use Beach so here you can see
this background looks nice for this form
so we actually we are actually done with
the outer styling of a form we have a
form here now what we are going to do is
we are going to style these elements as
well so we'll write over
here ul
and list style type so we are going to
remove these bullet point point from
here so we'll write over here none for
the first and here you can see all the
bullet points are gone then we are going
to write here padding is zero and margin
is zero fine save it so here you can see
we are done with the unordered list now
we are going to write here form Li and
we are going to do it for every list
element so we'll write it here like this
we are going to give margin top
to every list element so we are going to
give margin top to every element so
let's say the margin top is going to be
1 M so here you can see it's equal for
each element so the top margin is also 1
M then we have a difference of 1 M
between each input field right so that's
how it works now we are going to style
the label so we are using a HTML element
name right so here you can see now what
we are going to do is we are going to
align uh all the labels fine so we'll
write here display
as okay inline block save it and here
you can
see then we'll write here width
as 90
pixels save it so here you can see the
width it started taking the form of a
form the shape of a form basically then
we'll write here text align to the right
okay here you can see now what we are
going to do is we are going
to take a input element and text area
together so we'll write here text area
as
well so we need to make sure that all
the text field have the same font
settings by default so what we'll do is
we'll write here font 1 M and we are
going to
use sense Cerf here
fine let's just write something over
here and now save the program and here
you can
see so the font size is changed and the
next thing we are going to do is we are
going to give uniform text field size as
well so we are going to write here width
as 300 pixels and then we have box
sizing property box sizing we are going
to write here border
box so here you you can see all the
boxes are of same width so here you can
see the form looks nice now and the next
thing we are going to do is we are going
to write here
border as 1
pixel solid
and let's use this
color save it and here you can see the
Border
changed now what we can do is we can
also use the focus property of CSS to
focus on every box but we are not going
to do it right now so the next thing we
are going to do is we are going to write
some code for the text area and we are
going to align it vertically so we are
going to write here vertical align is
top and here you can see the message is
now present at the top it looks nice and
we are going to give height as well to
the text area as 5m and here you can see
the text area is a little bigger in size
when compared to name and
email now what we are going to do is we
are going to write here dot button we
are going to align the button with the
within the text field so we'll write
over here pedding pedding left basically
we are going to declare it as 90 pixels
and here you can see it looks
nice and let's just use 95 pixels here
maybe or we can use 93 yeah it looks
aligned right so it the button is done
and we are going to just use the button
element
here margin left
0.5m save it and yeah the form is we are
done with the form so this is the basic
CSS form so HT we used HTML to create
the structure and then we use CSS to
make it look a bit more interactive than
it was with the help of CSS so don't
worry guys we can do a lot of things
with CSS we can make a web uh we can say
form look more interactive way more
interactive then we can even think CSS
is actually interesting we can do a lot
of things with this form as well but
this time what we are doing is we are
going to see how CSS is basically
applied to a form to make it look more
attractive to the user so the background
color and all plays a vital role in
making a form look attractive to the
user so discussing talking about how
actually a form homeworks so here you
can see we have three different input
fields we have name email and message
just write name over
here okay and just let's write here cell
and message submit it and here you can
see it says please include an at theate
in the email address because here in
HTML we have used the type as email for
this input box so how actually a form
works we create the structure of a form
with the help of HTML then we use CSS to
style the and make it look more
attractive to the user and then at the
end JavaScript is used to validate that
particular form but now HTML also
provides some sort of validation to any
form with the help of type and some
other attributes so here we haven't used
JavaScript till now so what will happen
if we are going to create a full flash
form with back end and front end both
we'll take input from the user we'll
submit it and the data will be sent to
the server and then we can retrieve any
data from the server or we can submit
the user data to the server as well so
HTML CSS and JavaScript together comes
together to actually create a form this
time we are done with the HTML and CSS
part we have created a form and we have
styled it with the help of CSS
JavaScript was developed in the year
1995 by a person named Brendan Ike
Brendan was working for Netscape
Communications while he developed
JavaScript in 10 days there were few
changes in the name of JavaScript
initially it was mocha which was later
changed to live script and then it
finally became JavaScript the start of
JavaScript wasn't that good as so many
developers who were using Java at that
time they considered JavaScript as a
language for designers and non-engineers
no one ever knew that this small side
scripting language would have a great
future today more than 90% of the
websites out there they are using Java
JavaScript somehow many of you guys gets
confused with Java and JavaScript let me
clear it for you that both Java and
JavaScript they are different languages
they have almost nothing in common many
people say that JavaScript was named
after Java as a part of a marketing
strategy to gain wider acceptance and
recognition in 1995 Java was a buzzword
when JavaScript was developed that's why
they renamed JavaScript after Java let's
move on to what is
Javascript have you guys ever been
through a website where you can see
images that slides automatically one
such website is Amazon the homepage of
Amazon where we can see different types
of ongoing sales is an example of
JavaScript in Layman language JavaScript
is a lightweight scripting language used
to make web pages more interactive and
more lively earlier when JavaScript was
developed it was only a side scripting
language to do basic tasks like you can
add popups in your web page or you can
make your web page more interactive
nothing more than that but now the whole
scenario has changed with the help of
JavaScript we can create applications as
well if we talk about applications let's
take an example let's suppose we want to
create an app we can create it in
Android or in iOS but we have to learn
few different languages to create create
those apps for Android we have to learn
Java and XML and Swift We have to learn
for iOS but with the help of JavaScript
you can create hybrid applications which
can work on any platform without any
problem TCH giants like Google PayPal
Amazon and YouTube they are using
JavaScript these days the evolution of
JavaScript in the past few years was
unbelievable suppose you want to create
a single page website everyone of us is
familiar with Gmail let's suppose so
Gmail is a single page website which
looks more like desktop software than a
website so Gmail is based on angular.js
it is a popular framework by Google
which is free of cost and it is totally
based on JavaScript now let's go over
some of the features of JavaScript these
features are actually why it is
considered that using JavaScript is
advantageous over other languages so let
let's start with some of these points
JavaScript is not a proper programming
language indeed it is a scripting
language which works in the runtime
environment just like python so there
are few other languages like C++ and
Java they need a compiler to work but
with JavaScript you don't need a
compiler once you are done with the
script it will interpret and show you
the output in the browser directly next
up is lightweighted Javascript R can
provide programming facility to some
extent in JavaScript you don't need to
specify any data type or return type
which helps in making development more
quicker that's why it is known as
lightweighted JavaScript is both client
side as well as server side technology
client side technology runs on the
user's computer whereas the server side
technology runs on the web browser
initially when JavaScript was introduced
it was introduced as a client side
technology but with the introduction of
node.js in 2009 one can now work in the
back end as well there is a way to
validate the users Data before sending
it to the web server and we can do that
with the help of JavaScript the data
will be checked for correct form and
value all we have to do is start a loop
give it the condition to check the data
JavaScript is also platform independent
although originally designed to work on
browsers only but now it is a platform
independent language which means once
you are done with the script you can use
it on any browser or platform without
any problem JavaScript is an object
based scripting language although many
programmers do not consider JavaScript
as a true objectoriented programming
language due to its lack of class
concept it does support other features
of objectoriented programming like it
supports encapsulation it supports
polymorphism and also it supports
prototypal
inheritance the last but not the least
feature of java JavaScript is case
sensitive so when it comes to keywords
identifiers names and functions
JavaScript differentiates between
capital and lowercase letters we have to
keep this in mind while
programming now I will quickly go over
some of the JavaScript applications
where JavaScript is currently being
implemented first one that comes to
every person's mind is web development
it was also the main motive behind
developing JavaScript we have
Technologies like angular we have
node.js we can create beautiful web
pages also JavaScript can be used along
with HTML and CSS to make those static
looking web pages more engaging if we
talk about other applications of
JavaScript we can use it in app
development either mobile app or web app
like we took the example before that how
hybrid apps made with the help of
JavaScript can take over traditional
Android and iOS app one of the most
important and unique application of
JavaScript is in smart watches the
bangle.js is an open-sourced Smartwatch
powered by JavaScript Gordon Williams
the man who is currently working on this
project it is said that this new
open-source stack built around
JavaScript will replace the onboard
firmware soon the next application of
JavaScript is client side validation as
we discussed earlier JavaScript is used
to validate the user data whether the
user's input is correct or not by
crosschecking it with the given
condition like the user wants to enter
in your website and you want it to be a
user with at the gmail.com in his email
ID so you will give that condition to
JavaScript and it will cross check it
with the users information like when the
user will try to enter in your website
it will check that if at the gmail.com
is there or not in the users's email ID
so it can validate the user also apart
from that one more application of
JavaScript is game development
JavaScript can be used to make fully
fledged 2D or 3D games using different
libraries although most JavaScript game
development focuses on creating games
used in browsers only let's start this
video with the introduction to Dom Dom
stands for document object model it is
an API for HTML and XML documents which
helps JavaScript to understand what is
there written inside the HTML document
API stands for app ation programming
interface to understand API better let's
take an example of a restaurant imagine
yourself in the restaurant you are
sitting at the table with the menu the
chef in the kitchen is also part of the
system the waiter here works as a
messenger between you and the chef
that's what API does it works as a
moderator between JavaScript and the
HTML document Dom defines the whole HTML
document in a her iCal form to make it
understandable for JavaScript so that
other JavaScript functions can work over
it it represents the entire document in
the form of object and nodes whether it
be elements or text or anything stored
in the document the entire page content
can be accessed or manipulated by
JavaScript Dom is not used with
JavaScript only other languages like
python also uses dom dom was designed to
be used in independently to begin with
dom there is nothing special you have to
do different browsers have different
implementation of the document object
model every browser uses Dom to make the
web page of the document accessible by
JavaScript let's move on and see what is
document object model with the help of
an example I believe you guys have the
basic knowledge of HTML and CSS a
prerequisite for this course let's start
things off with a basic HTM ml example
here we have a code that consist tags
like HTML head body heading tag Etc we
have the HTML tag here the opening HTML
tag and the closing HTML tag inside the
HTML tag we have the head tag which
contains the document's header part
inside the head tag there is a title tag
that contains the title of the web page
then comes the body tag which contains a
heading tag and two div tags with IDs as
div 1 and div2 a div tag defines a
particular section in the HTML document
the ID used within the div tag it is an
attribute basically that has to be
unique within the document to make the
element unique from other elements next
up we have a paragraph tag with a class
attribute within it CSS and JavaScript
uses classes to select and access
specific elements don't worry guys if
you have no idea about it let us first
see the output of this code before going
to the document object model of this
whole document so guys this is the
output of the previous code we just came
through here we can see the title of the
web page as well as heading after it
there were two different div tags used
in the code here is the output of both
the div tags the question here is where
are those ID and class attributes seen
in the output the answer to this
question is there's nothing on this web
page that can show both of them we can
use them in our CSS file or through
JavaScript to specify the containers in
which they are used so we have concluded
how a normal document works and how the
browser interprets the HTML clue but how
JavaScript uses this code is a bit
different that's where Dom comes into
play when the actual HTML document is
loaded in the browser another
representation of that document is
created known as document object model
here's the model you can see on your
screen each of the tags used in HTML
document is correspondingly represented
as objects in the dog like starting from
the HTML tag and covering all the other
tags like head title body and few more
the same hierarchy as there was in the
HTML document goes with the document
object model also document object model
is simply the same HTML document with
different representation the reason
behind this different representation is
that it's easy for JavaScript to
interpret this format JavaScript can't
understand tags but it can understand
these objects JavaScript can easily
manipulate these objects using different
functions which we will see in future
while working on these function for
example if you want to access the text
present inside the heading tag you can
do it by accessing The Heading tag with
JavaScript you can also work on the
style of this text with the help of
JavaScript as well JavaScript uses the
concept of nodes it can access noes of
the document object model there are many
types of nodes present in the Dom the
basic three types are element node
attribute node and text node the element
node consists of all the tags used in
HTML document like the head tag and the
body tag the attribute node contains the
attributes used in HTML document by now
I hope you have understood the concept
of attributes so JavaScript can access
these attributes as well and the user
can work upon them as per requirements
the text here in the HTML document that
is simply it can also be accessed with
the help of JavaScript it is the value
of that particular element variables are
named storage that a program can
manipulate as the name suggest a
variable is a value that can change
according to conditions variables refers
to those memory blocks inside the
computer where we can store information
let's suppose you want to store any
value inside your computer so variable
will represent the location of that
value in simple terms variables are cups
with stuff inside them and you can use
that stuff later again and again
according to the way you want to before
the introduction of es6 or ecmascript we
can say which is the updated version of
JavaScript variables were declared using
a single keyword only which is where
we'll try to declare a few variables
here we'll see how where keyword works
so let's comment this thing first so
let's declare a few variables let's
suppose where a equals to 15 we will
declare where B and the value of B will
be six we will declare where C and the
value of C would be a + b so here we
have defined three variables a b and c a
is a variable with value 15 stored
inside it and so is B the value of B is
six but C is a variable that will
contain the value of a + b let's try to
print this on browser document.
write and we will print the value of
C save it and here you can see the value
of C is
21 that's the correct answer so
similarly you can also print a and b as
well let's print a and b as well here
what we will do with will copy this line
we'll paste it for a
and we'll update this here as well so it
won't create any
confusion so here you can see the value
of C is 21 the value of a is 15 and the
value of B is 6 it shows the value of
all the three variables we declared but
with the introduction of es6 or my
script in 2015 two more ways were
introduced to declare a variable these
are let and const we shall discuss these
two terms in the later part of this
session let me show you how to declare a
variable there are a few things you have
to keep in mind while declaring a
variable name here we have seen we use
three variables a b and c that was an
easy task to do but giving a variable
any name like something other than a
single alphabet so you have to keep a
few things in mind while naming them
start them with a letter underscore or a
dollar sign you can't use any sign
except underscore or dollar so if you
are giving a variable name you can't use
any other sign except the underscore or
the dollar sign you can use these two
signs only you can't use any other sign
you can't use a number in the starting
apart from that let's suppose you want
to give it a name as 9be you can't do
that in JavaScript JavaScript won't
allow you this if you try to save it it
will throw you an error invalid or
unexpected token so you can't do this in
JavaScript there is no limit for the
length of the variable name but you
can't use reserved keywords in a
variable name like let's try to create a
variable with name as class class is a
reserved keyword in JavaScript we'll
save it and see here it throws an error
unexpected token class but you can use a
class with capital c let's save it and
here it will work fine why it works
because JavaScript variables are case
sensitive if we try to create variable
with same name Let's see we try to
create a variable with where girl and
the another variable will be where girl
with capital G this time JavaScript will
treat these two variables differently
these two are different variables for
JavaScript as JavaScript is case
sensitive when it comes to variables
let's declare a few more variables let's
remove it we'll declare a few more
variable let's comment this part as
well we'll declare a few more variables
suppose we declare a variable with
keyword where and we'll name this
variable as bike name where bike name
and press enter if we leave this
variable without assigning it any value
the by default value will be undefined
let's try to print the value of this
variable right we will try to print the
value of bike
name save it here you can see the value
it shows is undefined so the by default
value of a variable if you do not assign
it any value will be undefined let's try
to give it a value let's suppose we try
to give bike name we use equals to
operator to assign it a value to assign
let's suppose we'll assign it Yamaha
semicolon and press control+ s to save
this and here you can see the output as
Yamaha you can also assign a value to
the variable during declaration as we
have done in the previous examples here
we have assigned the variables value at
the time of Declaration only let's move
on to let and const so we will discuss
let and const but first we will compare
let with where let is also used to
declare a variable just like where is
used but there is a limitation to use
let let is not accessible outside the
Block in which it is declared so we will
use let here only let bike name equals
and we will change this value as well
we'll change it to Hero let's say save
it and here you can see the output as
hero but if we try to put this code
inside a block let's suppose we put this
code inside this block a pair of curly
braces and we will again try to access
document do right we'll try to access
bike name again from here from outside
the block we try to access say this save
it and here you can see by name is not
defined it is an error in line 18 so
what's happening here basically you
can't access a let variable outside the
scope you can't access it from here but
it will work with where if we try to
replace let with where and save it here
you can see it says hero and hero
because first it will interpret this
method and then it will interpret this
as well in case of where due to its
limited scope let variables are used
when there is limited use only like in
for Loop or in while loop we will learn
these Loop in future let will not allow
you to redeclare any variable let's
understand this with an example here's
the code as well we have declared where
bike name and we'll remove this and
first we'll try to do this with where
let's suppose where bike name equals to
TVs control+ s it says hero and TVs so
the variable name the bike name is say
same in both cases here and here as well
these are same but with where keyword
you can do that let will not allow you
to do this if we use let here in place
of where we'll write let here as well
and we will change the value as well we
will give it
as
Kawasaki and let's suppose Suzuki
here save it see bike name has already
been declared so that's what let won't
allow you to do you can repeat the same
let variable in different scope it won't
create any problem but it will not allow
you to redeclare any declared variable
so let's move on to const we use const
when there are values we don't want to
change or that will never change
basically so the keyword const is little
misleading as it defines a constant
reference to a value not the constant
value we can't change the Primitive
value but we can change the properties
of constant objects let's write another
piece of code for const
keyword so let's declare a variable
const X is equal to
5 comma Y is equal to 7 let's say
on so here here what we have done we
declared a variable X and a variable y
with value as 5 and 7 we declared this
time with const keyword and the variable
Zed which is x + y we printed Zed on the
browser and it shows the value as 12
which is x + y 7 + 5 is equal 12 now
what we will do const will let you do
this but if you try to update the value
of x let's suppose we try to update the
value of x as X = to X +
10 we'll print X this
time document.
write X let's save this it will throw an
error assignment to a constant variable
in line 24 so here you want to update
the value of x you can't do this with
const keyword you can do this with let
and where as well but you can't do this
with const also const won't allow you to
redeclare any variable just like let so
if you try to use const x
again equal to 10 save it so here it
says identifier X has already been
declared this thing you can do with
const the scope of const is the same as
let it can be used within the block
where it is declared data types is an
essential Concept in every programming
language to work on any variable you
should know its type it refers to the
kind of data data which is being stored
inside a variable the type of variable
is holding basically every programming
language has its own set of data types
which is unique in its own way we
discussed earlier that JavaScript is a
lightweight scripting language because
we don't need to specify any data type
in JavaScript after all all the
variables in JavaScript are Loosely
packed or we can say JavaScript is a
dynamically typed scripting language we
shall discuss these properties later in
this video for now let me tell you about
different data types present in
JavaScript so JavaScript data types are
divided into two categories primitive
data types and non-primitive data types
primitive data types are stored in stack
whereas non-primitive data types they
are stored in Heap I don't want you to
go deep in these two terms as if you new
to programming so we'll leave it just
keep one thing in mind that primitive
data types are base data types whereas
non-primitive data types are objects or
we can say they are derived primitive
data types they are further divided into
five categories they are divided as
numbers strings Boolean undefined and
null non-primitive data types or complex
data types we can say on the other hand
they are divided into two parts arrays
and objects we'll have separate videos
on these topics for now let's discuss
primitive data types to understand
primitive data types much better let's
declare a few variable here let's say we
declare where X and give it the value as
16 we'll declare where Y and we'll give
it value hello W we'll declare one more
let's say
where
flag and the value will be
true here we can talk about those
properties of JavaScript which I
mentioned earlier JavaScript variables
are Loosely packed and JavaScript is a
dynamically typed scripting language
these two points refer to the same thing
here you can see we have defined three
variables X we have defined variable X
we have defined variable Y and flag as
well the values for all three variables
is different from one another see
variable X is holding a value that is 16
variable Y is holding a value hello
world which is a string so 16 is a
number hello world is a string and
variable flag is holding a value that
refers to a Boolean value in place of
true we can also write false here so
what's happening here here you can see
there is no data type if you are coming
from a C++ background or a Java
background this will be a little bit
weird for you guys because in C++ and
Java we used to do it like we'll Define
an integer let let me show you so how we
will define an integer in C++ or Java
what we'll say we'll use in X = to 5 or
something like that we already had a
data type for string as well we have car
in C++ but here in JavaScript we have no
data type we are only using the wear
keyword that's what we call as Loosely
typed this line means that you don't
have to define the data type of the
variable what happens in JavaScript is
whatever the type of value you will pass
to the variable the data type will
change accordingly so you don't need to
worry about if you are passing a number
or if you are passing an
string just relax just when you pass the
value to the variable it will be
determined automatically so these are
the three basic primitive data types
present in JavaScript which are
number Boolean value and string so let's
move on to the next one which is
undefined we'll Define a variable p and
we'll leave it as it is so this variable
P has an undefined data type it means
that any variable which is already
declared but has no value inside it it
has an undefined data type I'll tell you
a basic operator the type of operator
we'll go through the operators in later
videos but just try to understand the
basic need and use it with me for now
this operator will help you know the
type of value a variable is holding see
let's use it here we have declared a
variable P we'll check the type of of P
so to use this operator you have to use
it with document dot right
now so we'll do document. WR and we'll
use two
brackets and inside it we'll
write type of and whatever like we want
to know the type of variable X let's
suppose we'll write here
x semicolon save it and you can see here
it says number this means that this
variable has a value which is a number
similarly we will check for all the
variables present here we'll check for
every variable we'll check for y we'll
check for flag and we'll check for p as
well let's copy this and paste it three
time and let's change the value here
from X to Y in this
line and from X to flag
here and here we'll change it to P so we
have done it we'll save it and see here
it says number first variable y it says
it's a string because you know hello
world is a string it's a sequence of
character for variable flag it says
Boolean so it's defined as true or false
and for variable P it's written here
undefined with this we are left with
only one primitive data type the null
data type there's a difference between a
null value and an undefined value
undefined means lack of value whereas
null means the absence of any value
suppose you are using null as the value
for any variable the type of operator
will return this variable as an object
but if you're not giving any value to
this variable you are leaving it after
declaration the type of operator will
return undefined here's an example for
this see we'll declare one more variable
here we'll declare where num let's name
this variable num and we will give it
the value as null we'll use document. WR
type of and we will check with the help
of type of operator that what type of
value the variable num is holding so
let's give here num we are good to go
press control+ s and see here it says
it's an object so a null value will
always be shown as an object we'll talk
about the complex types or composite
types in further videos we'll have
separate videos for each of these types
don't worry about it the term control
statement is is pretty self-explanatory
and straightforward right we came across
JavaScript statements in previous videos
JavaScript statements are the
instructions that tells the browser to
perform specific actions control
statements are also instructions and
they govern the flow of control in a
program so let's take a look at control
statements with the help of an
example let's suppose we have a piece of
code that has n number of statements
here let's say we have this code and so
the conventional workflow will be it
will first execute the first statement
then second then third and so on till
statement n right so this is the basic
flow right from statement 1 till
statement n and it will execute each
statement in between however in real
world the scenario is different like we
don't write the code in same manner
every time for example let's suppose you
are in line five and you want to print
this line 10 times so what should you do
you can write this line 10 times or you
can copy paste it right okay let's
forget about 10 times let's suppose you
have to use this code or we can say
let's suppose you have to print this
statement 100 times doing this like copy
pasting it for 100 times or writing this
statement for 100 times that's useless
and unnecessary right so that's where
control statements comes into picture
we'll discuss them in a while let's
assume another situation this time you
want to make a choice based on certain
conditions you can use conditional
operators but then it has limitations
right to tackle this problem we have
control statements in
JavaScript so these are the very basic
reasons why we need control statements
for performing a certain activity like
if we want to perform a certain activity
n number of times or if you want to make
a certain decision- making kind of
scenarios in your program that's where
we need control statements in
JavaScript in JavaScript we have two
different types of control statements
depending upon what action we are
performing so we have the conditional
control statements and we have the
iterative or we can say looping control
statements talking about conditional
statements as the name suggests we use
conditional statements when we have to
make decisions based on conditions when
we have two choices or when we can say
when we have two different conditions
and we want to make choices accordingly
so that's where we use conditional
statements we have two different types
of conditional statements the IFL
statements and the switch case talking
about the iterative statements as the
name suggests if you want to perform any
action more than once or maybe a number
of times instead of writing them again
and again we use Loops so Loops are
basically statements we use Loops to
perform any activity n number of times
with specific conditions so in
JavaScript we have four different type
of Loops we have for Loop while loop do
while loop and foreign Loop so the for
Loop while loop and do while loop you
might have heard about them earlier
because they are also present in other
programming languages but this foreign
Loop Loop this is a new type of loop
present in JavaScript we use foreign
loop with objects we'll go through
objects in upcoming videos and of course
we'll be looking at each of these
control statements in detail we'll have
a particular video for each of these
topic now let me introduce to you the
break and the continue statement they
are not the types of control statements
but they do assistant other control
statements
the brake is used to exit a switch
statement or Loop like when used in a
loop it breaks the loop and continues
executing the code after
it and on the other hand the continu
statement breaks a single iteration when
used in a loop when we use continuous
statement in a loop it breaks a single
iteration and it breaks the iteration
only if the specified condition occurs
and then it will continue with the next
iteration in the loop so the if else
conditional statement is used whenever
we work with condition it can be either
a single condition or maybe more than
one condition or multiple conditions we
can work with so let's try to write a
basic program with a single condition so
then we'll move on to multiple
conditions using the Els if statement so
we'll create a new file today so I hope
you guys know the importance of creating
a separate file for every topic you know
it will be easy for you you to work uh
to find out that separate file later if
you want to revise that topic so here is
the program where we have taken a
variable X and the value of x is 10 so
what we are doing in this program is we
are checking if the value the variable X
is holding that is the value 10 and if
the value is less than 10 or if the
value is Le greater than 10 so we have
only two conditions either the value can
be less than 10 or the value can be
greater than 10 or equals to 10 as well
so here in this program what we'll do
we'll first we'll update this value as 8
so the variable X is holding the value 8
so to check the output let's save it and
here you can see it says the value of x
is less than 10 of course the value 8 is
always less than 10 right so for 8
that's fine it will say the value is
less than 10 and similarly if we do the
same for let's say 11 save it now and
see it says the value of x is greater
than 10 so that's quite simple right but
what if we are giving the value as 10 we
know 10 is equals to 10 so save it now
and see here you can see it says the
value of x is greater than 10 this is
happening because what we did we as we
told The Interpreter to check the value
if the value of x is less than 10 we
didn't mention that if what to do if the
value is equals to 10 so it will will
check for only X is less than 10 not for
equals to 10 or greater than 10 so here
what it is doing it is checking if the
value is less than 10 so that it says
okay let's print this statement if the
value is less than 10 or if the value is
not less than 10 or if the value is
equals to or greater than 10 it will
print the value of x is greater than 10
to Avid this type of misunderstanding we
use an Els if statement so the concept
of L if statement is the same as if
statement what we are doing we are using
multiple conditions right we are giving
it more than one condition so how to use
LS if it's quite easy and the syntax is
also similar to the if statement the
only difference is that it contains an
else before if so it's an else if so
what we are doing is we are giving it a
condition that L if x equals to 10 so
now what it will do it will check for
two conditions that if the value X is
holding is less than 10 or equals to
10 and what we'll do we'll update it as
so let's check the output now save and
see here it says the value of x is
equals to time right so I hope you guys
are getting this the execution flow for
this program will be like it will check
for the first condition if x is less
than 10 if yes it will print the value
of x is less than 10 if no it will move
on the to the following condition like
under the elsf statement it finds a
condition that if x is equals to 10 it
will check for it if yes if x is equals
to 10 then it will print the value of x
is equals to 10 or if not then otherwise
it will move to else statement and print
the value of x is greater than 10 we
don't need to specify any particular
condition for this you know because we
have already specified the two
conditions that if x is less than 10 or
if x is equals to 10 now we'll take a
look at some basic programs other than
this one we'll take a look at a few more
basic programs so here's the another
program what we are doing here is we are
taking a variable X and the value of x
is five so what we are doing is we are
checking if the number is an even number
or an odd number the thing you have to
keep in mind is the logic to find
whether a number is even or an odd
number so to check uh whether a number
is even you what we do we'll divide that
number with two right what basically we
want is we want the remainder as zero
when we use the modulus operator so what
we'll do here we have written X mod 2
equals to equals to 0 so if the remainer
is zero then the number will be an even
number because it is divisible by two
else it will be an odd number so that's
quite simple right let's save it and
check the output for 58 it says odd
number yeah five is of course an odd
number right so that's for even and odd
number so here we are with another
program here it says we have a variable
Y and the value of y is let's
say 8 and what we are doing here is we
are checking if a number is positive or
negative or zero so we have three
different conditions either number can
be positive or it can be a negative
number Any number greater than zero is a
positive number right and any number
less than zero is a negative number and
the third one is a number zero it's
neither positive nor negative so let's
check for the number eight save it and
see here you can see it is a positive
number let's see
for minus 2 save it now it says a
negative number for zero it will say
zero so these two programs are quite
simple guys right the conditions are
pretty simple we use modulus operator we
used greater than or less than sign and
that's quite easy to use right so let's
move on to the next program which is a
bit tricky than these two so what we'll
do in our next program is we'll check if
a number is positive or negative and at
the same time we'll check for even and
odd also if we are giving any number as
input like let's suppose we are using
five we'll check if the number is is
positive or negative and odd or even so
we'll do this simultaneously let's move
on to this program so there are two ways
to check whether the number is positive
or negative and odd or even so the two
methods we'll discuss them one by one
the first one here is to use nested if
and the another one is when we use
logical operators along with the if else
if statement so this one here you can
see right in front of your screen is the
nested if method so here you can see we
have used the if statement we have given
one more condition inside another if
statement so first it will check whether
a number is positive or not for X
greater than Z it will check if the
number X is greater than zero then if
yes if it will find it that yes this
number is greater than zero then it will
move on to the nested if and it will
check for odd or even for odd number and
even number it will check if it finds
that the number is even it will print
that the number is positive and even if
the number is not even it will print the
number is positive and odd so here you
can see the difference what The
Interpreter is doing is it will check
for the number as positive and if the
number is positive then it will move on
to the nested if and check for the even
or odd so if it finds that the number is
even it will print positive and even
otherwise it will print positive and odd
then it will move on to the next
condition which is for negative number
if x is less than zero then it will
again move to the nested if and it will
check for even and odd so if it finds
that the number is even it will print
negative and even otherwise it will
print negative and OD and the last
condition is for the number zero let's
try to find out the output of this and
what we'll do we'll update the value of
Xs eight so save it now here it says the
positive and even so eight is a positive
number and even as well let's update the
value of x as minus 5 save it now it
says negative and odd number minus 5 is
a negative odd number right so that's
how it will check for positive or
negative and odd or even so we are doing
both the things simultaneously in a
program we have an alter method as well
here you can see on your screen we have
written a program and here we have taken
a variable X the functioning of both the
programs is same both of these program
will check for positive or negative and
odd or even so here you can see I have
taken a variable X let's say the value
of x is 7 it will check for X greater
than 0 and x mod 2 is equals to equals
to 0 so we have four different
conditions right a number is greater
than zero that means a number is
positive and even a number is positive
and odd a number is negative and even a
number is negative and odd and the final
one is a number is zero okay we have
five conditions and we have to specify
these four conditions here so here you
can see we are using the logical and
operator this means it will print this
statement let's suppose for this
statement it will print this only if
both the conditions are true right if
the number if the value X is holding is
both greater than zero and an even
number so if you try to find out the
output now save it and see here it says
number is positive and odd so the number
seven is greater than zero but the
number seven is not an even number
that's why this line is not there on the
browser it will print this line because
the number is positive and odd right the
switch case is another conditional
control statement and just like the if
else control statement there's a
difference between the usage of if Els
and switch case statement now both if
Els and switch case works with
conditions and we have to choose when to
use switch case over ifls switch case is
generally preferred over the if Els when
there is n number of test cases present
or we can say when we are working with a
lot of conditions let's say we are
working on a program and you ask the
user for an input between 50 and 100 a
numeric input basically and in the
output we have to print the textual form
of that number suppose if the user
enters 75 right the output will be like
this so what we are doing we we are
taking a number from the user as an
input and we are printing the text form
of that number right so we can use the
if else or we can say else if control
statement but the program will be so
lengthy and not so clean also switch
case is much more efficient than if Els
when it comes to execution time like if
we have n number of conditions then
using switch case is a better option
we'll get to know why in a bit so let's
move on to the programming part and
today we'll write a program where we
have to find the month in a year by
accepting its number so we have 12
months in a year for example if we enter
four then the output will be April and
if we enter 8 then the output will be
August because August is the e8th month
of the year right so I hope you guys are
clear with the question of course we can
do this program with the help of IFL
statement but we discussed earlier that
using IF else in such cases is not
efficient right we can use switch case
in this scenario so let's create a
variable first let's say we are creating
a variable where month and you can give
any value to this variable from 1 to 12
you can provide it with any initial
value so let's create a variable first
let's say we are creating a variable
where month and the value we are
providing it one as the hardcore initial
value for Simplicity again we are not
taking the input from the user or from
the browser to do so we have to first go
through the Dom manipulations and we'll
go through it in later videos so let's
start with the switch case now the
Syntax for switch case is quite simple
just write down switch and pass the
variable month so we have to check in
this round bracket for the variable
month because you know any value you are
providing to month the switch will check
the program accordingly so for now we
have taken the value as one for month we
can take any value like we can take
three we can take 11 12 or any value
other than 1 to 12 as well so whatever
value you are providing to the variable
you can provide the variable to the
switch statement right so next up we
have an open and a curly braces for the
body of the switch case we have to test
for 12 different conditions inside
this starting from 1 to 12 right so the
syntax goes like this you have to write
case and then the value month variable
might hold like one 2 3 and so on
followed by a colon right so we have to
write the value one and a colon not a
semicolon but a colum keep this thing in
mind guys and below that we are going to
write what we want when the value is one
like what the output we want when the
value is one so we have to write
document do
write and whatever you want as the
output like for one the first month is
January so we are writing
here January and a
semicolon so if the value of the month
is one you'll get the output as January
save it and here you can see the output
is January let me increase the font size
for this as well so here you can see the
output is January right next we'll use a
break
statement if you guys remember we
discussed the break statement in the
control statement video right The Brak
statement is not actually a type of
control statement but it assist other
control statements or we can say it
helps us manage the control statements
right what this statement does is once
we are done with our output we get our
output right once we are done with case
one we get our output as January this
break statement helps us to come out of
the switch case so to understand this
much better let's write here one more
case so let's say we are writing here
one more case case
as case
2 and the output will be document do
write the second month is February
right and February here we can write
so we'll include one break here like
we'll come in the first case and include
a break statement so here's how you can
write a break statement how you can
include a break statement in your code
so let's check the output now so for now
it says
January so if we don't include this
break statement here when The
Interpreter will execute this code and
it will see that the case is one right
so it will print January but it will
print other statements as well so for
example if you remove this break
statement and save it now see you can
see here the output as January and
February January and February both are
getting printed on the output so we need
a break statement to break it here see
the value is one and if we include break
statement here the moment The
Interpreter finds the answer the correct
answer as January it will come out of
the switch case so I hope you guys are
getting this similarly we'll write all
the cases for all the months let me show
you all the cases so here you can see on
your screen that we have 12 different
cases from 1 to 12 one for each each
month depending on the value the
variable month is holding right the
output will be June if the value is six
and if we say 10 the output will be
October and so on and so forth now the
question here is what if we try to write
a random value for the variable month by
random value we mean that if we try to
write any value other than these 12
values from 1 to 12 if if you leave
these values then if we try to write
another value like if we write here 13
so what will be the output now let's
save it and see there's no output and
there might be no error for this as well
so if you try to check for an error go
to inspect and check
out see there's no error right so in
that case we have one more case like we
have default
case so let me show you how to include
default in your program what you have to
do is write here
default with a column and write
document do write and let's suppose we
are writing here wrong
input what is happening is let's try to
run this program First Press control+ s
and now you can see it says wrong input
for Value
13 so what is happening is the switch
case will first check these 12 cases
and any value other than 1 to 12 will
get the output as wrong input it works
the same as the else statement right in
else statement we don't need to specify
any particular condition any condition
other than the if condition or else if
condition will fall inside the else
statement it's not necessary to add
default in your program it's just if you
want to give the user a prompt that he
has entered a wrong value so you must
include this default case in your
program every time while using switch
case because it's quite useful you know
okay so this is the complete program to
find out the month by accepting its
number if you try six and save it now it
will say June if you try 10 save it it
will say October if we try 12 save it it
will say December so I hope this is
clear to you guys next up let's discuss
about switch cas in detail because the
switch case in JavaScript Works
differently from other languages like
switch case is also present in C++ and
Java but in JavaScript it is a bit
different so in JavaScript switch case
can accept numbers it can accept strings
and Boolean values as well now let's
have a look at how the switch case works
with string values so here is an example
of string values you can see the value
variable month is holding is June right
and you can use this string in case as
well so here you have to give the case
as a string value right because we are
using switch case statement with strings
so the first case here is when the value
will be June the output should be sixth
month and when the value is July the
output will be 7th month so let's check
it out if this is working or not let's
save this program and see for June it
says sixth month and similarly we can
check it for July as well let's check
for
July save it and see it says 7th month
you can include the default case as well
if you want to it will be similar like
there's no difference for default case
let me show you
how we'll write here wrong
input and save it and now let's let's
try to change the value here let's say
we are using May save it and see it says
wrong input what if we use a numerical
value here let's try to use two save it
now it says wrong input for two as well
it will give you the output when the
value is either June or
July so any other value you try to use
here it will give the output as wrong
input in the same way it works for
Boolean values as well let me show you
how it works for Boolean values so what
you have to do instead of two you have
to give here a Boolean value let's
suppose you are writing here true and
for true you have to change the case as
well for
true you have to change the output as
let's say for true it the output will be
one okay and similarly for
false the output should be
zero and the output should be wrong
input for any other case right so save
it now and see here for true it says one
the output you can see here is one and
if you try to do the same for false like
let's write here
false and now try to check the output
see here it says
zero you can see the output is correct
right we will discuss uh our first
iterative control statement that is the
for Loop in JavaScript so iterative
state stat Ms or looping statements we
can say are used when we want to perform
an activity multiple times or n number
of times so we don't have to copy paste
that code every time but we can use
iterative statements using iterative
statements will make our code clean and
definitely more efficient so we have
four different types of uh iterative
control statements right we discussed it
in the previous video let's move on to
for Loop which is a first alterative
control statement and we'll move on to
the programming part directly so before
we start one thing to keep in mind guys
is that we use for Loop when we are
clear with the number of iterations in
advance so let's start with our first
program in this program we will print
the multiplication table of 10 from 10
into 1 to 10 into 10 let's start with
coding first we write the for keyword
and then we have three different parts
we have the
initialization which is separated by a
semicolon next up we have the
condition and finally we have the
increment or
decrement so this is the Syntax for for
Loop the next up we have the open and
the closed curly braces for the body of
for Loop we'll change these three values
as these are not the actual values right
parameters for these three different
parts of the loop are going to be
different so let me comment this one so
we'll what we'll do we'll leave it here
only we'll change it from here so in the
initialization part what we are going to
do is we'll create a variable let's say
we are creating a variable where a and
the value of and the initial value of a
will be
1 this initialization happens only one
time when the for Loop begins we have to
be careful about the condition we are
going to use because sometimes what
happens is the loop runs forever because
of a wrong condition which will
ultimately crash our program so in the
condition what we have to do is we have
to give a value as in for how long a
fall Loop should execute here in this
case we want to print the table of 10
right we want to have 10 iterations so
what it will do it will start from a
equal to 1 and it will go till this
final condition so let's suppose we are
writing here a less than equals to 10 it
will start from a equal to 1 and it will
go till a less than or equals to 10 and
next up we'll use the increment operator
we want to increment the value of a by 1
every time right so we'll use increment
operator A++ or we can say a = to a + 1
both are the same things right so here
the condition will be like this for
variable a = to 1 a less than equals to
10 and a
++ so here you can see the loop will
execute from A = to 1 till a = to 10 and
the value will will be increased by 1
every time because we have used the
increment operator right next up the
body of for Loop will go like so what we
want to print here we want to print the
table of 10 right so we'll use
document do WR and inside document. WR
we'll use the H1
tag so what we want to do is we want to
print the T table of 10 right so we'll
multiply 10 by a for every iteration the
value of a will be multiplied by 10 and
then it will be printed on the browser
so we'll close the H1 tag
here in the
semicolon so here you can see we have
printed 10 into a let's save it and
check the output first and then we'll
look at the execution flow of this
program see here the multi lication
table of 10 is printed on the browser
you can see 10 20 30 40 so on and so
forth till 100 so what is happening is
firstly the for Loop is also known as
the entry control Loop it means that the
condition is checked initially the first
time the for Loop runs we perform
initialization only once so here the
value is to at variable a is 1 initially
the value is one next St it will check
for a less than equals to 10 is a which
is 1 is 1 less than equals to 10 then
true the control will be shifted to
document. right and it will print 10
into the value of a is 1 right so it
will print 10 here next thing it will go
for the increment and the value of a
will be changed to two from 1 1 + 1 or
we can say 1al to 1 + 1 right so it will
be two now next thing it will leave this
now because the initialization happens
only once now it will go for the
condition directly now it will check for
is 2 less than or equals to 10 if yes
then again the control will be shifted
here and it will print 10 into 2 because
the value of a is 2 now and after that
it it will print 20 here and after that
the value of a will be increased to
three because we have used A++ then it
will check for three is 3 less than 10
and same thing will happen it will print
30 and so on and so forth till the value
of a is 10 now if the value of a is 10
it will print 100 right and when the
value is incremented it will become 11
so what will happen now it will check
for 11 less than equals to 10 no we know
that 11 is not less than equal to 10
right then it comes out of the loop and
it will print nothing after that so this
is the basic working of the for Loop
we'll go through one more program
wherein we'll print the odd numbers
between 1 and 10 so what are odd numbers
odd numbers are those numbers which are
not divisible by two right so we have
the odd numbers say 1 3 5 7 9 and we
want to print them so the difference
between each number is of two the 1 + 2
+ 2 + 2 till 9 right so what we have to
do is we have to write here A + equal to
2 we have to increase the value of a by
two and instead of writing here 10 into
a because because this time we don't
want to print any multiplication table
we want to print a number only right so
we'll use a only save it and check the
output it says 135 7 9 so these are the
odd numbers present between 1 and 10
keep one thing in mind that you have to
give the condition wisely every time so
next up we have the V Loop like the for
Loop while loop is also an entry control
Loop which means that the condition will
be checked first so the question here is
how while loop is different from the for
Loop if you guys remember when we
discussed that we must know the exact
number of iterations then only we can
use the for Loop right so the V Loop is
preferred when we are not aware of the
number of iterations or we can say we
don't know if the condition will be true
for a certain number of times we'll
start with the programming part now and
then we'll discuss more about when to
use y Loop over for Loop
so let's start with the program in this
particular program we will print odd
numbers up to a specific number let's
say we want to print all the odd numbers
up to
50 so we want to print all the odd
numbers from 1 till 50 right we came
across the same program in the previous
video as well but this time we will use
the while loop instead of for Loop so
the Syntax for the while loop is
relative L easy to use the code goes
like we start with the while keyword
then opening and closing round round
brackets and finally the body of Y Loop
in curly
braces if you guys remember from the
previous video wherein we Ed the for
Loop we had three different parts right
we had the initialization we had
conditions and the increment decrement
part here we have only one condition and
until this condition holds true the V
Loop will be executed for example here
we want to print all the odd numbers
from 1 to 50 right so we'll first
initialize a variable let's initialize a
variable first let's say we have a
variable X and the value of x will be
1 we used here one because one is the
very first odd number right after that
inside the condition what we want to do
is we want to print the odd numbers up
to
50 so while the condition will be like
while X less than equal to 50 so the
loop will go till X is less than or
equals to 50 or we can say x less than
50 that depends on us if we want to
check for 50 or not so the odd numbers
will go like 1 and then we have three
then we have five then we have 7 and up
to 50 so the last odd number will be 49
so inside the while loop we will print
the value of x so here we will print the
value of x let's print it
document.
WR and inside this we will print the
value of x inside the H1
tag suppose we try to run this program
now it will go on an infinite Loop and
the reason for this is we are not doing
anything to increment the value of x
just like in for Loop if you remember we
had the initialization first we had the
initialization here as well then we had
the condition we have a condition here
as well and then finally it has an
increment or decrement part right so
here we don't have that same increment
or decrement part we have to do it
separately so we'll increment the value
of x here only so here we will write x +
= 2 or we can say it is same as x = x +
2 you guys are aware of it right so the
reason is simple because we want to go
from 1 to 3 to 5 and so on that's why we
use x + equal to 2 we incremented the
value of x by
2 save it here and let's check the
output so here you can see it says 135 7
9 and so on and so forth till 49 so 49
is the last odd number before 50 because
we are checking between 1 and 50 right
so 49 is the last odd number let me show
you how the program goes into an
infinite Lo Lo so for that what we have
to do we will command this whole line
here let's check the output now save it
and here you can see it is refreshing
forever and this is basically how a
program in an infinite Loop looks like
the output of this program is the
program will ultimately crash so what we
have to do we have to open a new tab and
then again we have to run the program
with correct increment part so here you
can see you can wait for it to become
responsive or or exit the page so here
you can see we have all the odd numbers
from 1 up to 50 and the last one is 49
coming back to the difference between
the V Loop and the for Loop we did the
same program previously right using the
for Loop so where to use while loop over
for Loop so consider a scenario where we
are taking input from the user and the
input from the user is why we want to do
something let's say we want to print
something on the screen or if the input
from the user is n we want the process
to be stopped we can give the condition
in the while loop which will go like
when the character y becomes n the
process will be stopped we'll go through
one such program once we are done with
the Dom manipulation part wherein we
take the input from the user let's move
on to the doy Loop in
JavaScript in the previous videos we
have already discussed that both for
Loop and the Y Loop are entry control
Loop that means the conditions are
checked first right but the dowi loop is
a bit different print or we can say it
is an exit control Loop wherein the
condition is checked after the execution
of the loops body thus an exit control
loop executes at least once even if the
test condition fails or we can say the
condition is wrong the loop will execute
once using the dowi loop is relatively
easy it seems like we are giving the
system a command to do something while
the condition is something so let's
start with the syntax now
the syntax goes like this we write the
keyword do and we have a pair of curly
braces for the body of the loop and
after that we have the while keyword and
here we'll write the condition make sure
you are using the semicolon after the
while loop it's necessary while using do
while loop keep this thing in mind so we
have two parts in the do while loop the
do part and the while part or we can say
the condition part while part is the
part where we write the condition so
let's define a variable first let's say
we are using a variable we are using a
variable X and the value of x will be 5
so here we have taken five as a random
value you can take one as well now
inside the condition part of the doy
Loop this is the condition part where we
are using the while keyword so we'll
give a condition let's say we are using
while X greater than 5 it will check for
the condition that if the value of x is
greater than 5 or if the value of x is
smaller than or equal to 5 it will come
out of the loop in the do part we will
write what we want to do let's say we
want to print a single sentence here we
write document.
write and whatever sentence we want to
write let's say we are
using welcome
to Simply code so here you might be
thinking that the condition is false but
the condition will be checked after the
first iteration in the do while loop so
no matter what the condition is the
first iteration will happen always so if
we try to save this program and let's
try to run this here you can see the
output is welcome to Simply code a
single line is printed what is happening
here is although the condition we used
was wrong but the condition will be
checked only after the first iteration
when the dowi loop will perform this
particular statement when the document.
right will be performed after that it
will check for the condition if x is
greater than 5 or not if we use here six
instead of five let's try to write here
six instead of five and if we run this
program now it will go into an infinite
Loop because we are not performing the
increment decrement operator here right
as we have discussed in the previous
videos the importance of increment
decrement part so we need to do it here
after the document. WR part so what
we'll do here we'll write x- - today we
are using x-- and for the other two
Loops we use the plus increment M ment
operator right so the X -- is the same
as x = x -1 let's check the output now
save it here you can see the output is
still welcome to Simply code the
execution flow of this program will be
like it will first perform the iteration
before checking the condition and it
will print here welcome to Simply code
for the first time when the loop will
start executing it will first perform
this statement and it will write here
welcome to Simply code so then it will
perform x - minus means the value of x
is now five because we are decrementing
the value by 1 so when the value of x is
5 then it will check for the condition
if x is greater than 5 or not so here we
can see clearly X is not greater than 5
because xals to 5 and it is equals to 5
right so it will come out of the loop
let's make few changes in the code here
suppose we use here 10 instead of 6 now
and let's print the value of x as well
it will be easy for you to understand so
we'll print here x and we'll use a space
so that it will be clear for
you we'll use here the BR te and now
let's try to run this program here you
can see the output goes from 10 to 6 and
it prints welcome to Simply code every
time right if you guys are wondering
where we use the dowi loop sometimes it
may happen that even though the
condition is false but we have to
execute that command we use the doy Loop
when we want the code to Output some
sort of menu to the user or to generate
the menu at least once we'll get to know
about the doile loop in future videos
when we create a program specifically
for the doile loop this video is just a
syntax demonstration we'll go through
the examples of all the three Loops
present in JavaScript so today we have
three different problems for three
separate Loops right we'll go through
each of the problems and we'll discuss
the execution flow for each Loop we'll
go through so let's start this session
with our first problem statement so the
first problem statement goes like this
so here we have to write a program to
check whether a number is prime or not I
hope you guys are aware of what prime
numbers are right so a prime number is a
positive number that is only divisible
by 1 and itself for example 2 3 5 and we
have 7 and 11 these are the first few
prime numbers right if we take an
example let's say we are taking an
example of seven so seven is a number
which is divisible by 1 and seven only
no other number can divide seven right
so here in this code we have to check
whether a number is prime or not so let
me take you through the code so here is
the code to check whether a number is a
prime number or not let me take you
through this first so we have a variable
number and the value of variable number
can can be any random value like any
number you want to check if the number
is prime number or not you can give that
value to the variable number so here we
have taken 83 next up we have a variable
is prime whose value is a Boolean value
right it can be true for a prime number
or it can be false for a non- prime
number so we have used comments in this
program to make it easier for you guys
to understand so here we have used the
if statement to check if the number is
one because we know that one is neither
prime number nor a composite number
right so we have to check if the user
enters the value one or if we are giving
the value one we have to check for it so
if user enters the value one it will
print this statement that one is neither
prime nor
composite here in LF we are checking if
the value of number is greater than one
or not so if the value of number is
greater than one the control will be
shifted to for Loop present inside the
elsf statement right here you can see we
have the for Loop here the control will
be shifted to this for Loop so here you
can see we have initialized a variable I
and the initial value is set to two
that's because any prime number is
divisible by one as well right so it
won't make any sense to include one here
we'll start from two and we'll check
until the value of I becomes half of the
value of number so if we take an example
of 10 we'll check until five because you
know any number greater than five won't
divide 10 right it's practically not
possible so we'll check for number by
two or we can say we'll check till five
only and the value will be increased by
one every time till now I hope you guys
are aware of how to use for Loop and why
we are using for Loop here we can do the
same program using while loop as well
but to make it more clear how to use for
Loop we are doing this program with the
help of for Loop so then we have the I
++ or we can say we have increased the
value of I by one after every iteration
and until the value of I
becomes half of the number so the
condition number percent I equals to
equals to0 so here is the main condition
to check if the number is divisible by I
or not so the execution will be like if
we are taking here a number 10 it will
start from Two and it will check if the
remainder is zero or not so if the
remainder is zero then the value of is
prime will be changed to false and it
will come out of the loop next it will
check for the value of is prime if the
value of is prime is true or not here
you can see if the value of is prime is
true then it will print n or we can say
then it will print that the number is a
prime number else it will print that uh
the number is not a prime number if the
value of is prime is false for example
when we took the example of number as 10
so the value of is prime will be changed
to false because you know 10 divides by
2 is equals to 0 or we can say the
remainder will be zero so the value of
this Prime will be changed to false and
for false it will print number is not a
prime number so at last we will check if
the number is less than one if the
number entered by the user or any other
number we have taken like if we take
here minus5 so it will print the number
is not a prime number Because by the
usual definition of prime numbers any
negative number cannot be a prime number
that's a usual definition right so we
have to keep this thing in mind and here
in this else Loop we'll print that if
any negative number is entered we'll
make sure that the program gives the
output that the number is not a prime
number so let's try to run this program
and check the output let's save this
program and the output says 83 is a
prime number as 83 is not divisible by
any number except 1 and 83 for example
if we take here any number which is
divisible by so let's say we are taking
75 save it now and see it says 75 is not
a prime number okay here's a spelling
mistake it says 75 is a not prime number
so here we'll correct
this
is so we are done with it and save it
now now it says 75 is not a prime number
as 75 is divisible by numbers other than
one and itself right it is divisible by
three it is divisible by 5 15 and 25 as
well all these numbers divide 75
basically so let's take a different
value here let's say we are taking -
7 let's change the value here as or we
can take it as minus 75 let's save it
now so it says the number number is not
a prime number or if we want to try for
one as well let's take it as
one and let's check the output now so it
says one is neither prime nor composite
number because we have given here the
condition if number is equals to is
equals to 1 then it will print that one
is neither a prime nor a composite
number you can try this program with the
help of other Loops as well so let's
move on to the second problem statement
but before that let me take you through
the same program using the V Loop so
here you can see we have used the V Loop
for the same instead of for Loop here
you can see we have used while I less
than number by two and we have given the
increment condition here and we have
initialized the value of I at the start
of the program so if we try to run this
program it will give us the same output
there will be no change in the output so
we can use while loop as well so we'll
use the while loop in other program
let's move on to the second problem
statement so in this example we'll learn
to write a program in JavaScript to
check whether a number is an Armstrong
number or not so we'll do this with the
help of while loop let's have a look at
how to implement this program before
proceeding to the coding part let's have
a look at what is an Armstrong number so
an Armstrong number of three digits is
an integer such that the sum of the
cubes of its dig digits is equal to the
number itself so for example 153 is an
Armstrong number since 1 into 1 into 1
it means the cube of the digit 1 plus
the cube of five that is 5 into 5 into 5
which is equal to 125 and the cube of
three which is 3 3 are 9 and 9 3 is are
27 so it will go like
125 + 27 + 1 so which is equal to 153 so
an Armstrong number of three digits is
an integer such that the sum of the
cubes of its digits is equal to the
number itself so here we have the code
for the same this is the code to check
whether the number is an Armstrong
number or not so here we have taken a
variable and the value is 153 the value
of the variable number is 153 right
because we already know that 153 is an
Armstrong number there are few more
numbers like 3 7 is also an Armstrong
number next up we have taken a variable
sum and the initial value of sum is zero
we have used the variable sum to store
the value of the cubes and next up we
have a temporary variable so that we can
break a three-digit number and we need
the number after all this all this
program all this loops and all we'll
need the number we'll need the original
number to compare it with the sum of the
cubes which will be hold in sum so but
we need to break the number as well
right so we need a temporary variable to
break it here we use the Y Loop and the
loop will run until the value of
variable temp is greater than zero so
the initial value of temp will be 153
here in this particular case the initial
value will be 153 and the loop will run
until the value of 53 is greater than
zero next up we have a variable
remainder that stores the
last digits value as we are dividing 153
by 10
so theer here will be three so the value
saved at variable remainder will be
three for the first time then what will
happen with we are updating the value of
sum and the new value of sum will be 0 +
3 into 3 into 3 so 3 3 is are 9 and 9 3
is are 27 so the updated value of sum
will be 20 27 next up we are removing
the last digit from the number so for
example we have here 153 and if we
divide 153 by 10 the answer will be
15.3 that's why we are using here parent
because what parent will do it will
convert the float value into an integer
so if we try to perform a simple divide
in JavaScript like if we try to divide
153 by 10 it will give us 5.3 it will
give us a float value but we want an
integer value right so parcent will
change this value to the nearest integer
so 15.3 the nearest integer will be 15
so the new value of temp will be5 then
again this Loop will be executed and for
this time the variable remainer will
hold the value of 15 modulus 10 and the
remainder will be five right so the new
value of remainder is five and the value
of sum is 27 + 5 into 5 into 5 which is
27 + 125 right so the new value of sum
will be
152 and then again it will go to the
temp and it will divide 15 by 10 and it
will change the value to an integer so
1.5 will be changed to 1 and next up the
final value of temp is 1 which is
greater than zero right so it will
divide 10 by 1 and the remainder will
will be 1 so next up it will add 152 + 1
into 1 into 1 that is 153 right and then
it will divide 1 by 10 using the parcent
but this time the value will be zero
because there's no remainer right next
up we'll compare the value of the sum
and the number variable so the sum
variable here it is holding the value as
153 we break this number into three
different part then we took the cube of
these three number and and added them so
the final value of the variable sum is
153 and the initial value of number or
we can say the value we gave to the
variable number is 153 so right it will
print here that 153 is an Armstrong
number or if we use any other number
instead of 153 let's suppose we are
using 121 so it will print 121 is not an
Armstrong number let's check out the
output once let's save it and see the
output here is 153 is an arm strong
number so if we change the value of 153
to 1 12 1 so let's check the output now
it says 1 121 is not an Armstrong number
why because if we take the cube of each
of the digit and we'll add them suppose
the answer here will be 10 because the
cube of one is 1 and the cube of two is
8 and the cube of the final one is 1 so
8 + 1 + 1 is equal to 10 so that's why
one 121 is not an Armstrong number let's
move on to our last problem statement
where we'll use the dowi loop to find
the factorial of a number so here's the
problem statement where we'll have to
write a program to find the factorial of
a number so factorial of an integer is
the product of an integer and all the
integers below it or we can say before
it till one so if we take an example of
five so the factorial of five will be it
will multiply each number before it if
we take five the factorial will be 5
into 4 into 3 into 2 into 1 or if we
don't include one that's totally fine so
this program is pretty simple as
compared to the previous two we did so
this is a small one to let me take you
through this so here we have the
program and here we have three variables
right we have a variable I which is
initialized as one then we have a
variable n which is five and then we
have a variable F whose value is one F
is for factorial and n is for number we
want to check the factorial of and I is
for checking the condition so here what
we will do we'll use a loop where if we
for example if we are taking five then
the loop will go from 1 into 2 into 3
into 4 into 5 from one to that number
it's not like if we are using from 5
towards 1 but we are going from 1
towards 5 the answer will be same right
because we are multiplying all the
numbers in both the cases so here we
took five as the number next up we have
a variable F and the value of f is also
one as you know so here we are using the
doy Loop for the first iteration it will
perform this so the value of f for the
first iteration will be F = to F into I
which means F = to 1 into 1 which is 1
so the value of I will be increased and
it will become two and now it will check
for while 2 is less than equals to n yes
2 is less than n so it will again go up
and it will update the value of F and
the new value of of f will be 1 into 2
that is two then again the value will be
increased and it will become three and
then it will
change the value of f as well it will
become six and the value of I will
become four then it will check if four
is less than five yes four is less than
five and then it will multiply four with
six because the value of f was six right
so 4 into 6 it will become 24 and then
finally the value of I will be five and
it will check if the value of I is less
than or equals to 5 right while I is
less than equals to 5 yes that's true
because now 5 is equals to 5 and it will
again execute the loop and the value of
f will be 24 into 5 which is 120 and
then again the value of I will be
increased now it will become 6 which is
greater than 5 so it will come out of
the loop and it will print the factorial
of the number so let's save this program
so the factorial of five is 120 because
see here we have used the factorial of n
n is five
and the factorial is 120 so if we try to
give any other number here other than
five let's say we are using here 10 save
it it says the factorial is
3628 or it's 36
28,800 so if you try to multiply 10 into
9 into 8 into 7 so on till two or we can
say one the answer will be this you can
check it you can Google it or you can go
through it in your calculator for
today's session the topic of discussion
is how to become a backend developer so
if you're wondering how to become a
backend developer what skills are
required and what the responsibilities
are then you're in the right place but
let's wait for a while for more people
to tune
in I'd also like to thank all our
viewers for actively partici
participating in these sessions all
right so uh whilst you're at it if you
haven't subscribed to our Channel
already make sure to hit the Subscribe
button and the bell icon to never miss
an update okay so I see a lot of people
tuning
in all right so I think we're good to
begin now I'm sure all of you use social
media applications
now every time you click on a video
scroll through a feed perhaps search for
something the corresponding information
is displayed on your screen now these
applications provide an excellent user
experience but how is this achieved you
must know that every application
comprises of two parts there's the front
end and then there's the back end the
front end is what the user deals with
and the back end is what makes this
happen
in other words the backend includes an
application a server and a database the
backend application fetches the data
from the database and processes all
client requests the result of this is
made visible to the
user so now the question arises who is a
backend
developer a backend developer's role is
to focus on details like building an
effective website architecture scripting
and writing code code that serves as a
means of communication between the
website's database and the
browser and lastly to ensure data
integrity and
consistency so now let's look at the
skills required to become a backend
developer it is vital for you to have
good understanding of programming
Concepts like data structures and
algorithms this includes Stacks cues
link lists trees and graphs sorting
algorithms and search
algorithms next up is programming
languages and Frameworks one of the most
critical skills of a backend developer
is a depth of knowledge in backend
programming
languages this includes Proficiency in
JavaScript and its environments like
nodejs and
expressjs next there's Java this
language was particularly built from the
ground up to be run on server side
popular Frameworks include spring and
Java server
faces next up is python which is the
most popularly used language today it is
flexible and easy to use Python
Frameworks like d Jango and flas are
used for back in
development and lastly there's cop and
its Frameworks like asp.net core and
asp.net
MVC other languages include Pearl PHP
and Ruby now because backend and
front-end developers work so closely
together it is also helpful to have a
foundational understanding of frontend
web languages like HTML and
CSS now proficiency is essential not
only for performing daily tasks but also
for working alongside front-end
Developers for developing
Solutions next we have database
Management Systems a backend developer
writes code that is used to perform
relational mapping to fetch data from
the database some popularly used dbms or
MySQL SQL server and postc SQL next up
is Version Control again popular ones
are git and sub version they help manage
the project files and keep track of the
entire history of things that the
developer is working
on and lastly This Cloud hosting
platforms these platforms allow you to
deploy your product on the cloud service
provider so that it can be accessed from
the worldwide web most popular ones are
Amazon web services Google Cloud
platform Heroku and Microsoft
Azure of course there are non-technical
skills that are required of back-end
developers those who choose this
profession should be comfortable with
analytical processes have well-developed
problem solving capabilities being
interested in emerging technologies have
good communication skills and be able to
work independently and sometimes as a
part of a collaborative team now that
you're familiar with the skills let's
have a look at the responsibilities of a
back-end
developer first up is forming an
understanding of the performance needs
and goals of the website to develop
effective successful
Solutions development and management of
application programming interfaces
development of systems for websites to
accept and securely stored data such as
those required for payment processing
systems then there's writing code
testing and development solutions for
code related
issues then there's organization of
system logic other responsibilities also
include development of site architecture
using proper methodologies like agile
scrum framework and also providing
Solutions to system
problems lastly let's have a look at the
salaries of a backend
developer the average salary of a
backend developer in the United States
is around
$102,000 us per year the average salary
of a backend developer in India is
around 7 lak 23,000 Indian rupees perom
in this session we're going to cover the
topic of what is angular I'm sure all of
you use mobile and web applications we
from social media to healthcare
e-commerce and net banking these apps
are used by billions of people across
the globe now the main reason we use
these apps is that they offer seamless
user experience and interface but how
are they developed to provide such
reliability one of the Frameworks that
is widely used to build such robust apps
is angular so let's dive into the
session now so here is a list of topics
that we're going to be covering first up
we'll see why angular was introduced
then what is angular features of angular
angular architecture advantages and
limitations of
angular the learning curve of angular
and finally we'll look at some of the
companies that deploy angular so without
further delay let's begin why angular
now JavaScript is the most commonly used
client side scripting language it is
written into HTML documents enabling
interactions with web pages in many
unique ways so as a relatively easy to
learn language with almost pervasive
support it is exceptionally well suited
to develop modern applications but the
question arises is Javascript ideal for
developing single page applications that
require modularity testability and other
features perhaps not however we have a
variety of Frameworks and libraries
designed to help us with such things
with respect to front end development
Ang Compu and JavaScript together bring
in structure and consistency to your web
applications and also provide
scalability and
maintainability angular is specifically
developed for single page applications
so now the question arises what exactly
is
angular angular is an open-source
JavaScript framework written completely
in typescript now it was primarily aimed
to develop single page applications and
is maintained by Google angular as a
framework provides a few advantages
while also providing a standard
structure for developers it is designed
for web desktop and mobile platforms now
if you have a doubt here as to what
exactly single page applications are let
me help you with that now these single
page applications are basically
applications that get loaded just once
so the main page gets loaded onto your
browser so any further interactions does
not lead to loading of subsequent Pages
anything that has to be done further is
just an addition to the already loaded
page so these single page applications
are primarily developed using angular
moving ahead let's look at the features
of
angular we have four features that we're
going to be discussing we have the
document object model typescript data
binding and testing now let's look at
them one by one now the document object
model treats an XML or an HTML document
as a tree structure now here every note
in the tree structure defines an object
representing a part of your document
angular uses the regular Dom now let's
suppose you've made 10 updates on a
single HTML page so every time you make
a change the corresponding Dom or the
tree structure needs to be updated now
angular updates the entire tree
structure of HTML tags moving on to our
next feature we have typescript
now typescript defines a set of types to
JavaScript which helps you write
JavaScript that is easier to understand
now all the typescript code compiles
down to basic JavaScript that can run
smoothly on any platform now typescript
is not mandatory for developing an
angular application but it is highly
recommended the main reason it's highly
recommended is that it offers better
syntactic structure while making the
code base easier to understand stand and
maintain now typescript can be installed
as an npm package now to do that you
just have to run the command npm install
hyph G typescript on your command prompt
next up is data binding now data binding
is a process that allows you to
manipulate web page elements using the
web browser now it mainly employs
Dynamic HTML and does not require
complex scripting or
programming it is used in web pages that
include Interactive components like
calculators tutorials Games Etc now
incremental display of a web page makes
data binding extremely convenient when
Pages contain a large amount of data
when it comes to angular it uses two-way
data binding so any changes me in the UI
element is reflected in the
corresponding model State and conversely
any changes made in the model state are
reflected onto the UI state this allows
the framework to connect the Tom to the
model data via the controller the last
feature we're discussing is testing
angular uses Jasmine to run its various
tests the Jasmine framework allows
various functionalities to write
different kinds of test cases karma is a
task Runner with the tests that use a
configuration file to set the startup
reporters and testing framework so with
that we've covered the features of
angular so let's go ahead and understand
the architecture of angular now angular
is a full-fledged MVC framework it
provides a strong opinion on how the
application should be structured and
offers bidirectional data flow and
updates the real dwn MVC short for model
view controller is an architectural
pattern that separates the application
layer into model view and controller now
model here relates to all all the data
related logic view on the other hand is
used for UI logic of the application and
controller is the brain of the setup now
it is an interface between the model and
view moving on let's look at the
advantages of
angular first up we have custom
components angular allows you to build
your own components that can pack
functionality along with rendering logic
into reusable pieces
data binding as discussed angular allows
you to effortlessly move your data from
your Javas script code to the view and
react to user events without having to
write any code
yourself dependency injection angular
allows you to write modular services and
have them injected wherever they needed
this greatly improves the testability
and reusability of the same don't worry
if you can't wrap your head around these
popets we're going to discuss them
further in the coming
videos next Advantage is testing angular
has been built from the ground up with
testability in mind you can literally
test every part of your application
comprehensive angular is a full-fledged
framework and provides outof thebox
solutions for Server communication
routing and more lastly we have
excellent browser compatibility angular
is crossplatform and browser compati
an angular application can typically run
on all browsers be it Chrome Firefox
Safari and platforms like Windows Mac OS
and Linux now many versions of angular
have been released ever since its
Inception all of these versions have
added to the efficient working of the
framework now here are the different
versions released first up was angular
one it was built on JavaScript and
completely based on controllers next
release was angular 2 now this
Incorporated the component based
approach wherein the entire UI was
divided into several components and
lastly integrated to give the final
logic next was angular 4 it included
router updation angular CLI or command
line interface 1.0 was introduced
however not deployed in this release the
angular CLI was optimized and commands
like NG update and NG add were added in
the angular 7 release prompts were
introduced which provided tips in CLI
about the functions being
used in angular 8 IV renderer and basil
were
introduced and finally the most recent
release was angular 9 now this came with
the better framework and angular
material now this completely switched to
the IV renderer as a default compiler
now that we've learned about the pros of
using angular let's look at some of the
limitations of angular
first up is a steep learning curve now
since angular is a complete full-fledged
framework it becomes difficult for
Learners to begin with you need to be
acquainted with simple topics and then
move on to more advanced topics to
become proficient in this language next
up is limited SEO options now angular
offers limited SEO options and poor
accessibility to search engine
crawlers if we worse and complex now a
common issue faced by the angular
Community is the verbosity of the
framework it also poses to be complex
compared to other front end tools and
lastly migration now one of the
drawbacks of angular is poor migration
now it becomes difficult to Port Legacy
code to angular style
architecture also with each new release
it is painful to upgrade and a lot of
them are not backward
compatible next up let's look at the
angular learning
curve now if you wish to learn angular
you need to be acquainted with basic
topics in angular some of them are
directives modules decorators components
Services dependency injection pipes and
templates now once you've mastered your
Basics you will want to go and
understand more advanced topics such as
such as change detection zones aot
compilation and rx. JS however the
learning curve of angular is clearcut in
the beginning it could be a little
intimidating but once you start using
the tool becomes way more easier to
comprehend and understand what is going
on and lastly let's look at some of the
companies that use angular today many
top tier companies like Nike fobes
Google gole HBO Sony upwork among others
readily deploy angular so moving on
let's look at the prequisites for
angular first up we have nodejs angular
uses nodejs as its base for a large part
of its build environment so as a result
to get started with angular you will
need to have nodejs installed on your
environment so head to their official
website and download the latest release
for your corresponding operating system
next up is the angular CLI now this
command line interface is a tool that
makes it easier to bootstrap and develop
your angular applications now to install
the latest version run the command npm
install hyph G at angular
frcl you got to run this command on your
command prompt and finally to confirm
installation check for its version now
the next thing that you will need is an
IDE or a text editor to type your code
now there are several Ides that you can
choose from but in this series we've
used VSS code throughout so it is
available on all platforms so go ahead
and download it if you haven't already
now moving on to the final part is the
demo now that you have a basic
understanding of angular and its
prerequisits I think you're ready to
create your first angular application so
let's head to our vs code and begin here
I created a folder called angular on my
desktop and opened it on my visual
studio code so to create your app you
need to open the terminal just go here
and select new
terminal and now type in the command
NG new and provide the name for your app
so I'm just going to say hello world so
now this is going to
create just say yes so basically what
happens is that when you run the command
it will automatically generate a
skeleton application under the folder
that is Hello World in our is and it
includes a bunch of files and installs
all the necessary dependencies for the
angular
application so this could take a
while so once you've created your
application to run it first change the
directory so let's say
CD hello
world and now use the command NG
Ser now once it's compiled you need to
go to your browser and type in Local
Host
4200 and once you do that you can see
your
UI you can see that the application has
been loaded onto your browser and it
says hello world app is
running so this is how you create your
application so let's go back to our vs
code now as you can see here there are
many files and folders that are created
right so let's look at a few of them of
course we can't explain everything but
I'll brush through a few of them so the
first main component is basically the
root component now the root component
here is the
index.html so here if you open the file
and see it's a very small crisp code
right but the most important thing in
the file is this app Root element so
what this does is it's basically the
marker for loading your application code
so this is extremely important so the
next important file is the
main.ts now this is a part of the
bootstrapping piece all right so the
index.html file is responsible for
deciding which files are to be loaded
correct the main.ts file on the other
hand identifies which angular module is
to be loaded when the application starts
so this is just a brief explanation as
to what they're doing
next we have the app folder now here we
have the app. module. TS file now this
application module file can be thought
of as the code configuration of your
application so here's where the source
code starts from and moving on we have
the app. component.ts these are all
typescript files hence the extension TS
now this file basically is a root
component of your application and then
we have the HTML file for the same which
defines the appearance of what you can
see on your browser so let me just
change the message that is being
displayed so I'll say
hey welcome to
this
angular tutorial so let's save this and
when we go back to our
browser we can see the message hey
welcome to this angular tutorial being
displayed so like this we can make a
simple change and then it gets rendered
onto your browser so this will just a
brief explanation of what happens in the
background of your application first
we'll get acquainted to what exactly
angular components are then I'll help
you create an angular component by
showing a quick demo and lastly we'll
learn about component decorator metadata
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our Channel if you love
watching new and interesting technology
videos also hit the Bell icon to never
miss an update so what exactly are
angular components now I'm sure every DB
uses web applications and one of the
most widely used applications is GMA
correct now to help you understand what
components are consider them as Lego
blocks now they basically are combined
together to form the final application
so in this case here we have the logo
component then you have a signin
component an image component and then a
create account component now all of
these components generally don't affect
the working of each other but however
when embedded they Define the UI of your
application so I hope you understood
what components are so to go ahead let's
discuss some of its common features now
firstly they are the building blocks of
an application generally you have a root
component which is basically the app
component and then it branches out into
other components creating a
hierarchy and these components are a
subset of directives now don't worry
about what directives are because we'll
cover them later on in the series but to
give you an idea there are three types
of directives you have the structural
directives the attribute directives and
the component
directives only one component can be
instantiated per element in a template
now components are typically custom HTML
elements and each of these elements can
instantiate only one component now don't
worry you'll understand this better when
I show you the demo nextly a typescript
class is used to create a component now
this class is then decorated with the
ACT component decorator Now The
Decorator accepts a metadata object that
gives information about the component
now a component must belong to the NG
module in order for it to be usable by
another component or
application and finally components
control their runtime Behavior by
implementing life cycled hooks so this
was just a brief introduction to what
angular components are now you will only
be able to understand the working of
components when I show it to you
practically so let's head over to a
Visual Studio code now here back in my
vs code I've created a folder called
angular demo within which I've created
an angular application called demo
components once executed the browser
looks something like this so if you
haven't watched our previous video on
getting started with angular that is
angular hello world I highly suggest you
go through that video first it helps you
create your first angular application so
um now let's go ahead and create our
first component now the command used to
create our component is NG GC and your
component name once executed it creates
four different files now let's just see
how this works on our vs code now what
you can do is head to your terminal and
type in the command
NG g c and provide a name for your
component for example I'm going to just
call my component text compon component
all
right so what it does is that it creates
four different files you can see you
have four different files that have been
created and finally it updates the file
that is app. module. TS indicating that
this new component has been created so
here in your Source folder within which
has an app folder and again here you can
see that your four different files have
been created first is the HTML file
wherein you can Define all the code that
you want for your component next you
have the CSS file for your styling then
you have the dotts file which includes
the component decorator and finally you
have spec. TS which is basically a unit
test file all right and then in your
app. module. TS you can observe that the
component that you've created that is
text component has been imported that is
what the message conveys here all right
now let's go back to our app. component.
HTML now this basically has all the core
for your application so let me just get
rid of
[Music]
it and I'm just going to display a
basic heading
saying
hello welcome all right so let me save
it and if you go ahead and look at your
browser hello welcome message is
displayed now let's go back to our
component. HTML file and here let me
provide a
[Music]
message let me say
h 3 and let me display a message
saying welcome to this
tutorial on angular components all right
now in your text component. TS file
which is your typescript file the
selector mentioned here is app hyphen
text component now go ahead and copy
this and in your final component. HTML
go ahead and create your custom HTML tag
with the selector that you just copied
now this indicates that the component
that you just created that is the text
component is being Incorporated in the
final render so what happens is that
whatever is defined in the component.
HTML file is also being rendered in your
final output so uh when I save this
let's go ahead and check our browser you
can see that the message welcome to this
tutorial on angular components is
displayed so this was a simple creation
of a component now for this let's give
it some styling so here go to your CSS
file and provide some styling so for
example here I just say text
line and let me say Center and also so
in my app. component. CS I'm going to
give the same thing I'll say
H1 text align is
Center all right so let me save this and
there we go now we can also create
multiple components and Define the tags
in the app component now the components
are executed sequentially so now let's
create another component just to give
you a brief insight into it let's say Ng
GC image
component now here I'm going to be
adding the simply learn logo so I'll
show you how that works now you can see
that a new component has been created
with four files again so in my assets
folder here I've added the logo so what
I can do is back in my HTML file I can
go ahead and create an image tag so
first let me just display another
message
here just to avoid any confusion and let
me say this is the image
component and then let me
say
image source equals so the source is
basically
assets SL
logo.png and class
equals Center
all right so you can also head to your
CSS file and provide any sort of styling
that you need so let me just say
text
align to be
Center and then let's
create a styling for the image and here
I mentioned the code for the image so
let's save this and from the Cs file
let's copy the selector and create a
custom HTML tag in our final component.
HTML
file so there we go let's save this and
check the output and there we go first
the hello welcome message is displayed
next you have the message displayed from
the first component and then you have
the second component so this is how you
can create your own components and don't
forget to incorporate these selectors
into your final HTML file
so moving on to our next topic component
decorator metadata now as mentioned
earlier the at component decorator
accepts a metadata object that provides
information about the component correct
here is a list of properties of the
metadata object first up is the selector
now basically the selector is a CSS
selector that identifies this particular
component in a template now uh this
corresponds to the HTML tag that is
included in the parent component
you can create your own HTML tag however
the same has to be included in the
parent component so to help you
understand that better let's head back
to our vs code and say for example in
our text component here the selector
says text component correct for the time
being let's change it to say n
component all right now when you save it
and look at the browser the message is
not displayed so what we can do is you
can copy
this selector and then include this
here and now you can see that the same
component has been rendered onto your
output all right so the selector plays a
crucial role in that next up we have the
template now a template is an inline
defined template for the view now the
template can be used to provide some
particular markup the markup could
typically include some headings or
paragraphs that are displayed on the UI
next up we have template URL now it is
the URL for the external file containing
the template for the view so here you
can see this is basically the external
file that contains the template for the
view next up you have Styles now these
are also inline defined styles that can
be applied to the component view so so
any code that you provide in the CSS
file can also be included here next you
have the style URLs now this is a list
of URLs to your stylesheets that are
applied on your components view next up
you have providers now this is again an
array where certain Services can be
registered for your
component lastly we have animations as
the name suggests these are animations
that can be listed for your components
first we'll understand what exactly
dependency injection is
then we'll understand the demerit or the
drawback of not using dependency
injection then we'll understand
dependency injection as a design pattern
and finally I'll help you understand the
entire concept with the help of a demo
so let's begin what exactly is
dependency injection so let's consider
this I'm sure you're aware that angular
uses the concept of components the
entire UI of the application is divided
into several components now what if all
of these components perform similar
tasks be it accessing the database
rendering images Etc now instead of
writing the same piece of code for every
component you could write the code once
and then perhaps inject the same code
into every component now this is
supported by dependency injection now to
give you a better example consider two
classes A and B now let's assume that a
uses the objects of Class B and normally
in object oriented programming an
instance of Class B is created so that a
can access it objects but using
dependency injection we move the
creation and binding of dependent
objects outside of the class that depend
on them so dependency injection or di
keeps the code more flexible testable
and mutable also classes can inherit
external logic without having to create
on its own and lastly di benefits
directives pipes and components
next up let's have a look at the
drawback of not using dependency
injection now let's consider Class
Postal details that is dependent on the
number and the address
class in the postal details class The
Constructor creates copies of the number
and address so when you instantiate a
new postal details class The Constructor
instantiates a unique number and address
now although this looks simple there's a
problem with this code let's assume that
the number and address class
Constructors now accept parameters when
we change the numbers class the postal
details class gets broken now to
overcome this what we need to do is we
need to pass parameter to the number
Constructor so this applies to address
as well the first drawback of using this
traditional method is that the code is
not very flexible anytime the
dependencies change the postal details
class needs to be changed as well
and the second drawback is that the code
is not suitable for
testing once you instantiate the new
postal details class you get the same
number and address even if you change
the number and address classes every
time what of these classes are in turn
dependent on other classes then it's
going to be a chain reaction so to
overcome this we make use of dependency
injection now let's look at di as a
pattern dependency injection as you all
know is a coding pattern where a class
receives its dependencies from an
external Source rather than creating
them on its own so here in the above
example we have moved the definition of
dependencies from inside the Constructor
to the constructor's parameters so the
postal details class doesn't create the
dependencies anymore it just consumes
them so the postal dependencies class
doesn't create the dependencies
anymore so with that we overcome the
drawbacks of not using
di so now that you know what exactly
dependency injection is and how vital it
is let's look at a simple demonstration
to understand the concept better now
services classes modules components all
of these are benefactors of dependency
injection so in the demo I'm going to be
showing how dependency injection can be
used with the help of services and
injecting these Services into classes so
the main uh thought behind this is
normally competents are used to ensure
just a good user experience these
competents do not generally execute
tasks so to execute these tasks we make
use of services so a component can
delegate tasks like fetching data from
the server any network related issues
ETC to a particular service and these
Services can be made available to
components with the same thought what
I'm going to be doing is I'll be
creating a service that performs the
task of displaying an employee list
later we're going to inject this service
into the class using dependency
injection so let's head to our Visual
Studio code for the
demonstration all right so as discussed
I'll have to first create a component
that displays a button for the employee
and then I have to create a service
class and inject it into my component
now this service holds the employee
details such as name employee ID email
ID Etc so first let's go ahead and
create a company
so here let me just type NG
GC and the name of the component I'm
providing is M
info if getting your learning started is
half the battle what if you could do
that for free visit scaleup by simply
learn click on the link in the
description to know more all right so as
you can see here in my app folder I have
the component with four different files
all right so the next thing we have to
do is we have to create a service so to
create that we make use of the command
nggs you can either give s or service
and the service name I'm providing is
records so let me just say records
here all right here you can see two
files are created there is a spec. TS
file and the TS file all right so now
the service contains all the employee
data that needs to be displayed right so
let's go ahead and write the data so
first we're going to make use of three
arrays I'm going to be displaying
employee records for three employees so
I'll have to create three arrays and
provide certain information so let's go
ahead and do
that all right so the AR I'm creating is
called info1 for the first employee and
I'm going to be passing
information like name employee ID and
the email ID so the arrays of type
string and within which let me just
mention the details I'm giving random
information I'm just saying Adam
Taylor and some
random employee
ID and let's say at at ABC
net all right so I'm going to be
creating three records so I'll just copy
the same thing and paste for the rest
two let's just change
here provide a different name
here and same for the last one
and let me change the name of the array
as well all right so with the agenda to
retrieve this data in our component we
make use of the method for the same
right so this method Returns the
employee
data so let's go ahead and create this
method I'm going to call it get
info and then just say
string and then this will just
return this do info
one all right I'm going to be calling it
get info one for better understanding
same for the rest two as
well I'm just going to return different
arrays here
all right and lastly info three all
right now in order to retrieve this
information in our component we need
three more arrays right three more
arrays that will receive this data let's
go back to our component.ts file here
and then type in the following
code so I've created three arrays again
uh info received one 2 and three now
what we need to do is we have to accept
the information that is being sent from
the service correct now as I mentioned
services are implemented with the help
of dependency injection so what we need
to do is we'll have to first import the
service into the component.ts file the
key reason behind doing this is that
when angular creates this component and
instance of the service class is also
made to perform the necessary tasks
correct so let's go ahead and and just
import it here so I'll say
[Music]
import
records Services I'm sorry service
from and let's say records.
service all right and what we have to do
next is that we must also declare this
instance that is being created in the
providers array of the
component all right
so let's just say
providers and then say
records
service all right now we've created the
instance of this class right however to
access this instance an object is also
created so this object will in turn
access access the methods and variables
of the service class so for that we have
to create another object so let's do
that here in our Constructor method
let's say
Constructor
private and the object I'm creating is
called our service you can give a name
of your choice and then I'm going to
just say records
service all right now this object will
help me retrieve data from the service
so let's go ahead and use this in order
to get the employee details all right so
I've created three different methods
here get info from service class 2 1 and
three and these methods will retrieve
the data and add it to our array here
that is info received all right and
lastly we'll have to create an unordered
list in our HTML file here we haven't
added anything so so let me get rid of
this so now I have to create three
different buttons for three different
employees and when the user clicks on
the button the data is retrieved from
the service and then displayed on the UI
right so as you can see I've created
buttons for three different
employees and then I've made use of a
bootstrap class called list group info
and then I've inter ulated info which
displays the
contents of the info variable all right
now in order to call the methods in the
TS file we have to bind them with the
button so since it is bound with the
click event every time you click on the
button the information is displayed so
now the last thing we have to do is
we'll have to create a custom HTML tag
for the component and then add it to the
main component so let's just do that let
me copy this
here and then in my app component. HTML
let me get rid of
this and then let me just create this
I've just created the custom HTML tag
for my component and now just to
beautify the code
I'll write a
heading and let's say employee
details and then I'll also add the
simply learn
logo say image
source I've I've added the image here so
let me just say logo.png
I've also added some styling to it all
right so now let me just save this and
have a look at the
browser so here we go we have the logo
here and then employee details heading
and then we have three different buttons
created that is employee 1 2 and three
and when I click on
it the information of the employee is
displayed the name the ID and their
email address
so yeah so this is how you can make use
of dependency injection and inject a
service class into a component
dependency injection plays a crucial
role in
angular we'll understand what angular
forms are then we'll look at the
different types of form building
supported by angular next up we'll get
acquainted with features like form
control and group control and we learn
all of this with the help of a simple
demo so without further Ado let's
begin so what exactly are angular
forms now I'm sure every application
that you use comes with certain amount
of form filling correct be it your login
credentials or your sign up forms or any
sort of registration forms Etc so forms
are an integral part of a web
application you need forms to update
your profile or to enter sensitive
information or also to perform any sort
of data related tasks so now let's look
at the different types of form building
supported by
angular first off angular supports two
types of form
building first you have the template
driven approach and second you have the
reactive approach now let's look at them
one by one so talking about template
driven approach in this method the
conventional form tag is used to create
forms so angular automatically
interprets and creates a form object
with the help of the
directives Now controls can be added to
the form using the NG model tag now
multiple controls can be grouped using
the NG control group module so it
basically uses several module classes to
provide controls now if you don't get
this don't worry you'll understand
better when I'm showing you the
demo next up is Json values so form
value can be generated using the form.
value object form data is exported as
Json values when the submit method is
called lastly basic HTML validations can
be used to validate the form fields in
the case of custom validations
directives can be used so arguably this
method is the simplest way to create an
angular form so moving on to reactive
approach now this approach is the
programming Paradigm revolving around
data flows and propagation of change now
with reactive forms the comp component
directly manages the data flows between
the form controls and the data
models now reactive forms are code
driven unlike template driven
approach reactive forms eliminate the
anti pattern of updating the data model
via two-way data binding so it does not
use two-way data
binding and typically a reactive form
control creation is synchronous and can
be unit tested with synchronous
programming
techniques so now let's go ahead and
look at form control and form
group so consider a typical form
consisting of fields like name age and
location now a form control is basically
a class that enables validation of these
fields for each input field an instance
of this class is created now these
instances help check the values of the
field and see if they're either touched
untouched dirty pristine valid invalid
and so on so this allows you to check
every field for the value it makes it
easier to understand which Fields value
is invalid or which field has not been
entered
Etc now moving on to form
group so a form group class represents a
group of controls a form can have
multiple group controls the form group
returns true if all the controls are
valid and provide validation errors if
there are any so I hope this was clear
so moving ahead let's look at the demo
to explain all of these features I'm
sure it will become extremely clear once
you look at the demo so for that let's
head to our VSS code so back in my vs
code I've created a component called
form component and um I've also included
the simply learn logo just to beautify
the appearance so once you execute the
code
this is what you're going to see on your
browser so you just have the logo at the
moment the first thing we need to do is
we'll have to import to forms module all
right so oh uh but before we begin let
me tell you what the use case is so
we're going to be creating a user
registration form which is going to
include four fields that is the first
name last name email ID and a password
all right so now let me show you how to
import the forms module so in your main
uh app. module. TS file you'll have to
import forms module from angular
forms all right and then uh in your
Imports you'll have to just call it
here all right so this is just a simple
step and now once you're done with that
let's go ahead and start our form
creation so here in my component. HTML
let's enclose the entire form with in a
div tag so here let me say
div
class is a
container within which let me just have
one
heading it says user
registration all right and now let's go
ahead and create our
form so first let me just say
form now I'm going to create a div class
for every field so say
d
class equals form
group I'll explain it to you a little
later now first let's create a
label so label
tag
for basically it's the first name so let
me just say first
name and the tag will basically have
first name
again all right and let me just break
the
line next we have the field so let's say
input type is
text name
is first name and we have a class which
is the form control
class all right so this we have to do
for all the other fields so let me just
copy
this
and paste it like four
times I'll also add the tag three for
spacing
let's do that
here and finally we'll have the
[Music]
button so let's just add that
here with a type
submit and let's just say submit on the
button button so now uh let's go ahead
and change these values
here so here let me just change it to
last
name here as
well and here as
well and in this case it is going to be
email so let me just change it here
and finally we have passwords
so let's add that
here all right so let's save this and
just have a look at our
browser so there we go we have our uh
user registration form ready but I would
like to uh align it to the Center so let
me just do
that so here in my CSS file I'm just
going to uh align all the D tags to the
center and the label tag to the left so
let me save this and look at the browser
now and there we go we have our
registration form with a logo so this is
how you create a simple form now we'll
have to add a directive called NG model
now this directive when added into the
input tab tag will provide form controls
to every input field all right so here
let's just go ahead and say ngg
model that is
it so let me just copy this and paste it
for every other
field all right let me save this and
back in my browser let me
inspect and here you can see the
different types of classes like NG
untouched NG pristine NG valid are added
right so this indicates that angular has
recognized the form tag and it has added
these classes to the form as well as all
the fields so this is achieved when you
add the NG model directive in your input
tag now back in my vs code now every
form has an output property attached to
it called NG submit all right so this
property can be bound within a method
that method called the submit method so
once submitted this method is called
right so once we click on the submit
button this method has to be called so
to include that we'll have to just
sa
form NG
submit
equals
submit all right right so now we'll have
to define the submit method in our
component.ts file so here let me just go
to our component.ts file and let me just
get rid of unnecessary code here and
let's define a function called
submit and then here let me
just console log form
submitted all right so let me just get
rid of this as well it's unnecessary
here let's save this so what it means is
that every time you click on the submit
button this method is called all right
so let's just have a look at the browser
so first let's go to our
console and when I click on submit it
says form
submitted all right so the next crucial
step is to generate JavaScript
representation now we'll have to make
use of another directive called NG form
that is assigned to a template variable
okay so this JavaScript representation
helps with validating all the fields so
I'll help you understand that
better so back in our HTML
file let's just create a variable first
let's call it
login all right and say
NG
form okay now the NG form object object
includes the JavaScript representation
so now while you're calling the submit
method you're going to pass login as a
parameter so let's just say login
here and in my ts file again let's just
say
login and along with it I want login to
be displayed
so I say login again so now let's save
this and if you have a look at the
browser
let's click on
submit and now here you can see the
JavaScript representation So within form
I
can check for
email or say first name and here for
this field first name you can see
different properties attached you can
see invalid is it invalid or is it
untouched which is true or are there any
errors so this basically gives you all
information about the particular
field so we can make use of this feature
to validate the information so we're
going to learn about that in our next
segment moving on to form validation one
way to ensure that incorrect fields are
not submitted is by disabling the submit
button correct now apart from this you
can also specify certain properties in
your input tag for the corresponding
input field
now um let's say that the fields that
now let's say that the fields can't be
empty and the form only accepts names
with the minimum length of two and the
maximum length of seven all right so
here in my input tag I just mentioned
required meaning this field cannot be
empty and Min
length to two
and max
length to say
7 all
right so to check this let's go to our
browser and here let me submit the form
without filling the first
name and evidently there has to be an
error so when I submit
it and I look here but forms and here
controls and my first name you can see
that an error is shown here it says
required equals true that means there
there is one error now you can make use
of these form control objects you can
leverage form control objects to ensure
field validation and display a message
whenever an error
occurs right so to do that you need to
access these objects like errors or
invalid or touched all of these
properties or objects need to be
accessed for that we'll have to create a
template variable and then this variable
is assigned to this object so back in
our vs code let's
create a variable let me call
it
name and let's say Ng
model all right here the variable name
receives the control object so here back
in my browser when I submit again
without the first name you can see that
the
invalid property is set to True correct
so this helps us use this property to
alert the user with the help of a simple
if logic so back in my vs code let me
create another div
tag within which I mention NG
if within which I'm going to use a
simple if logic so let's say
[Music]
ngf name which is our template variable
name do
touched and and name do
invalid is
true right then I'm going to alert so
I'm going to make use of an alert here
let's
say
alert
Danger All right so in my CSS file I'll
have to mention the simple styling for
alert so here let me just say
so we're going to have the background
color red for danger all right and here
I'm going to display the
message in valid in
bold so now let's go back to our browser
and check it so let me proceed without
entering the last name it says invalid
here so this was a simple demonstration
to show you form
validation of course you can modify the
code depending on your requirement say
suppose the length of the first name is
too short then you can alert the user
with a different message or uh suppose
they have missed out on filling a form
field then you can again alert the user
so you can basically make use of the
nested if condition right now just to
help you understand that better let me
just show it to
you now back in my HTML
file instead of invalid let me have
another tag a paragraph tag within which
I make use of NG if
again now NG if name.
errors do
required is
true then I display the message
first name
required all right and
if the length of the first name
is not
2 now if the length of the first name is
less than two then I'm going to display
another message so let me just say name.
errors. Min
length if this is true then I'm going to
say
sorry short first name
all right so let's save this and have a
look at the
browser when I proceed without providing
the name it says first name required but
when I type in one character it says
sorry short first name but if I type in
another character it accepts so I hope
this made you understand how form
validation
works so this was just a simple
demonstration again now I highly
recommend you explore these properties
and play around with these objects uh
trust me it's really fun so uh I hope
this tutorial helped you
out first let's have a look at the
basics of routing now I'm sure that
you've observed that the URL changes
every time you click on a particular
link or on an icon on the user interface
correct now this basically indicates
that you are navigating throughout the
application now to achieve this
navigation we use a mechanism called
routing r routing is essentially used to
navigate through a website or a web
application but how is it achieved in
angular especially in angular routing
plays a major role it is used to create
single page applications now these
applications are loaded just once and
new content is added dynamically
applications like Google Facebook
Twitter and Gmail are a few examples of
single page applications the best part
of using single page applications is
that it provides an excellent user
experience and you don't even have to
wait for new pages to load which by
extension makes single page applications
extremely fast but how is this new
content
loaded enter routing now routing is the
mechanism that as discussed earlier that
is used to navigate through the
application and load new content routing
helps angular configure the route and
the component that needs to be
displayed now I'm sure you're going to
understand the concept of routing better
when you work on it handson so in the
demo we're going to be navigating to the
login and the homepages of a web
application with the help of routing so
let's head to our Visual Studio code so
basically the objective of our
application is to navigate to home and
the login pages so when I click on the
login icon here it loads the login page
and here you can see the
extension SL login and similarly with
home once you click on it some new
information gets added and the URL
changes with a slome appended all right
so this is the main objective of our
application so to create it let's head
back to our vs code all right so here
I've created a folder called demoore
angular and I've created a file called
demo routing now the first thing you
want to do is open the index.html file
and make sure that the base tag is added
now although this is generally added
when your app is created if it is not
then add a base tag with href attribute
which is set to a forward
slash all right now this is generally
done to tell angular to construct the
URL while navigating with a forward
slash all right and the next next thing
you want to do is open your app. module.
TS file and check if the app routing
module has been imported if not go ahead
and import it and then also mention it
in your Imports
array with that the initial setup is
done now to create the nav bar the code
that I'm going to be using is already
explained in the previous video that is
angular bootstrap I highly suggest you
go through that video before watching
this so uh the code is already available
I'm just going to create a component and
write the code for it and paste the code
in it so let's do that let me say NG
GC
[Music]
navbar all right so this component is
now created now here in my HTML file
I'll just get rid of this and paste the
code for the nav
bar so here we go I've pasted the code
for the navigation
bar and back in my app. component. HTML
file I'll just remove all The Unwanted
code here and just specify
the custom HTML tag for my
Navar so let me just create one
here all right let me save this let me
just run the application and see if it's
displaying correctly all right so when I
open the browser uh the navigation bar
has been created along with these
different options that's home about
services and login all right and we also
have the simply learn icon here all
right now the next step is to to
generate the components to display the
login page content and the homepage
content now again I have used bootstrap
to define the user interface for these
files you can easily find the code
online just search for uh bootstrap
login templates and depending on your
requirements you can choose the
appropriate one so first let's create
the competence for my two files that is
for the home component and the login
component
so let's go ahead and do
that NG
GC I'm just going to call it login for
my login
component all right and then I'm going
to say NGC home for the home
component all
right so so I'm just going to copy the
code for the login component so back in
my login.
HTML
file I'll just paste the code
here
okay also note that I've added the
simply learn logo in my assets
folder and then just provided the source
for
it here in my login
component all
right so next up is the home component
and if you've seen the previous video
that is angular bootstrap you might have
seen that we created three different
components that is intro courses and
footer which included the content for
the intro message for the courses and
the photo message correct so here we're
going to just paste the code for all of
these three
and then just displayed when the home
button is
clicked all right so what I'm going to
do is I'll just paste it
here so this basically has all the
content one thing I want to tell you is
that in the previous video we made sure
that the code was written in three
different components however for this
I've just added all the code in the same
component now I agree that this is not
the best practice so if you want you can
go go ahead and create three different
components and uh separate the code into
these three components and just add the
custom HTML tags in your home
component I'm just hoping you're uh
following me right now and also here in
my assets folder I've added a video and
the YouTube logo that needs to be
displayed uh when the home icon is
clicked all right so now that we've
created the home and the login
components the next step is to configure
the routes for the
application right so here you can see
that we have a file called app routing
module. TS file so here we have the
routes and the router module that is
imported and we also have a constant
called routes which is strongly typed to
routes from the router package all right
now this array is used to define all the
possible routes in the application now
each route is basically an object with a
path so here in my routes array I'm just
going to go ahead and create the paths
that is we have two different uh routes
right one is for login and one is for
home so I'm just going to create a path
object so let's say
path I'm sorry within curly braces I say
path and then the path that I'm going to
give is
login this is basically what will appear
uh on the URL all right and the
component that needs to be navigated to
is nothing but the login component so
let me just say login component as you
can see the login component has been
automatically
imported now same
with uh the home paths so let me just
say path
home and the component that needs to be
rendered is the home
[Music]
component all right now the next step is
to link these routes to a button in the
nav bar that is the home and the login
button right so we're going to make use
of the nav tag and an anchor tag for
this you can see that we have a nav tag
and an anchor tag which encloses the
login and the home components all right
now we're going to make use of two
directives from the router package
called router link and router link
active now these are specified within
the anchor tag the router link basically
holds the path to the page and the
latter that is the router link active
specifies one or more CSS classes that
will be applied when the router link is
active all right so to do that let me
just
add
router
link all right in our case it is home
here and we're going to have another
directive called router link
active and we just going to say active
here all right same for the login icon
here let me just copy
[Music]
this and instead of home the path we
created for this was
login all
right so this is how you can uh bind the
route to your specific button on your UI
now despite of all this is how are we
specifying where these components are to
be
displayed right the answer to this is
using the router Outlet directive now
again this directive is available in the
router package so we have to add that in
our app component. HTML
file so here just go ahead and type
router
Outlet all right so with that we've
created a simple navigation bar which
has different options that is home about
services and Link and once the user
clicks on the home icon it displays the
content that is in the home component.
HTML file and once the user clicks on
the login component it displays the
content in the login. HTML file all
right it's as simple as that so now
let's go to the browser and see if it
executes correctly so all right we have
the navigation bar and once I click on
the home icon
here all right yes we see that all the
content has been
loaded you can see we have uh the intro
section we have the courses section and
the footer section as discussed in
today's video we'll be learning all
about reactjs so let's jump in and see
what's in store for us so we'll be
covering topics on what is react why
react features of react react
prerequisites and its industry Trends
let's go ahead and begin with what is
react react is a JavaScript library used
to build fast and interactive user
interfaces for both web and mobile
applications now one thing that makes
react extremely powerful is the fact
that it's open source any user can
access its source code modify it and
enhance it in a typical model view
controller architecture react defines
the view part of the application it is
also responsible for how the app looks
and feels fun fact react was built by
Jordan walkey an engineer at Facebook
now let's go ahead and see how react
Works in real time consider a typical
web application say Instagram the entire
UI of the web page is divided into
several components we have the search
component a profile description
component stories component and a post
list component these components make the
code easier to debug and always remain
discret components also make development
and maintenance of web application
faster as multiple developers can work
simultaneously on different components
of the same web application now let's
see why react is so popular these days
deact helps in creation of dynamic web
applications it also provides
performance enhancements now there are
several performance enhancements like
virtual domor and oneway data binding
we'll learn about these topics a little
later in the video react uses reusable
components now this helps decrease the
development time react involves
unidirectional flow of data react also
has a small learning curve compared to
other Frameworks like angular react is
much easier to learn react can also be
used for mobile applications react
recently released an extension called
react native that is used for developing
mobile applications that are cross-
compatible it also has dedicated tools
for easy debugging now let's dive in to
the features of react first let's
understand jsx jsx is a syntax extension
to JavaScript using jsx we can add HTML
to the the Javascript file all coding in
react is done using jsx it also helps in
making the code easier to understand and
debug ultimately jsx is a combination of
JavaScript and HTML now let's consider a
small example con simple here is a
JavaScript notation H1 tags indicate
HTML again the semicolon indicates
JavaScript note that the semicolon is
not mandatory however it's a good
practice to include it moving on the
next feature is virtual dom dom which is
an acronym for data object model
actually defines how documents are
accessed and manipulated in a web page
it represents the entire structure of
the web page in the form of a tree now
let's see how this actually works react
creates a virtual Dom that is the exact
copy of the real Dom traditionally
whenever something changes in the web
application all objects in the real Dom
are updated this makes it extremely slow
let's see how react counters this now
consider two objects whose states have
been changed react now compares the
virtual Dom with the virtual dor
snapshot that was taken right before the
update by comparing the new virtual dor
with the pre-update version react
figures out exactly which virtual dor
objects have changed now react only
updates those objects on the virtual dor
this makes a big difference when it
comes to speed coming to the next
feature performance react uses virtual
domor as discussed earlier virtual do
impacts the speed of the web
applications we also took an example of
Instagram and learned how multiple
components can affect the development
time they help improve performance
drastically the next feature is one-way
data binding this means information
Flows In Only One Direction oneway data
binding is specifically used when
information is displayed and not updated
remember that the components of react
are functional in nature that is they
receive information through arguments
and pass information via their return
values the next important feature is
extensions react has many extensions
that we can use to create full-fledged
front-end applications it provides
server side rendering which means that
the application is rendered on the
server rather than in the browser react
native which is a react extension is
used for developing mobile applications
there are many other extensions that
react provides for every scenario in web
development now let's look at a few of
them react native lets you build mobile
applications using only Java script A
react native app is a real mobile
application and not just a web
application running on your mobile
devices thousands of applications like
Facebook Instagram Pinterest Skype use
react native the next popular react
extension is flux flux is the
application architecture that Facebook
uses flux implements a unidirectional
flow which makes it easier to understand
what actually is going on now let's see
how it works when we trigger an action
the dispatcher will get notified the
dispatcher receives actions and
dispatches them to the stores a store is
what holds the data of an application
stores will register with the
applications dispatcher so that they can
receive actions data from stores is
displayed in views actions define the
internal API of your application they
capture how anything might interact with
your application the last feature of
react is debugging react applications
are easy to debug thanks to the large
and active developer Community you can
practically debug react codes with in
your browser now notice the small react
extension icon at the top right corner
this developer tool allows the user to
inspect the code and also easily debug
it moving on let's learn about the
building blocks of react components
State and props are the essential
Concepts that one should know before
implementing react they are the
foundation on which react is built now
what exactly are react components
components are the building blocks of
any react application react divides the
user interface into multiple components
where in each component defines how a
particular element is viewed in the
application react components remain
discrete and are processed independently
another feature is reusability
components can be reused multiple times
across the application this reduces the
development time consider the following
code snippet a component is implemented
as a JavaScript class having some State
and a render method state is the data
which we want the component to render
the render method is responsible for how
the UI looks and feels to the user the
next concept is state state of a
component is an object that holds some
data this data influences the output of
a component every time the state of an
object changes the component is rendered
onto the screen now let's see what props
are props a short for properties allow
us to pass arguments or data to
components properties help make
components more Dynamic it is important
to Define all the properties their types
and their default value props are passed
to components in a way similar to that
of HTML tag attributes now consider the
following code Snippets this shows
exactly how properties are passed to
components also detailed illustrations
on components props and state will be
shown in the upcoming videos so stay
tuned for that moving on let's go
through some of the things that you
should know before you can actually
start working on react you should be
familiar with programming Concepts like
fun functions objects arrays and classes
one should also have a basic knowledge
of JavaScript and a familiarity with
HTML don't worry if you feel like you're
not good at them once you start working
on them you'll get a good hang of it
finally let's go through the impact of
react on the IT industry and get
insights into the salaries of react
developers statistics show that react
developers earn way more than other web
developers according to payscale the
average salary for a react developer in
the United States is a whopping
$91,000 the average salary for a react
developer in India is 7.25 lakhs perom
over the recent years react has gained
immense popularity and is being adopted
by many companies according to the data
by Google Trends react has had a better
growth scale compared to other
Frameworks like angular and view
statistics show that front-end
developers have wholeheartedly adopted
this lightweight framework forgoing
other available options if you are
skilled and have a knack for front
content development react can help you
gain fantastic career opportunities
lastly talking about a few companies
that use react devotionally we have
Facebook Instagram Netflix Dropbox
WhatsApp among others in today's video
we'll be learning all about react
installation on windows so without
further Ado let's get started to set up
the react development environment we
need two things installed node and a
text editor of your choice so let's
begin by installing node.js we can head
to the official node nodejs website say
download node.js so here you can see the
windows installer depending on your
system you can either download the
32-bit version or the 64-bit version so
I'm going to go ahead and click on the
64-bit version since it's already
installed on my system I'm not again
installing node you can follow the
installation guidelines and download it
once you're done with node installation
you can go ahead and download a text
editor of your choice so I'd suggest vs
code so let's head to the VSS code page
say download VSS code click on the first
link and download the 64-bit version for
Windows once you're done with the
installation of both node and your text
editor you can start creating your first
react application so for that let's
create a folder I'm creating it on my
desktop while you can create it in any
of your drives let's call it first react
now open your command prompt now you can
type in the path for the folder that you
just created
so say
CD
users first react now go ahead and type
in the command npm
install hyph G create react app okay so
this command installs all the necessary
reactjs modules now to check if the
version is correctly installed you can
type in create react app version so you
can see the version here now let's
continue and develop your react
application type in the command create
react app and you can give a name to
your application so I say my app now
this should take a couple of minutes
okay once you've successfully created an
application they say to begin by typing
the following commands so let's do that
save CD my app and npm start they should
typically start your application and
here we go
all right you can also open your
application in the text editor that
you've downloaded so let's go ahead and
open vs code vs code file open folder go
to your desktop or the drive that You'
saved your folder in first react my app
and I say select folder so as you can
see all your modules have been imported
you can click on app.js and start
editing in today's video we'll be
learning all about the most basic
infrastructure of reactjs called
components without delay let's begin and
look at what's in store for us so we'll
be touching on topics like what are
components types of components nesting
components higher order and pure
components and a brief description about
component life cycle all right to begin
with what exactly are components
components are the building blocks of a
react application wherein each component
represents a part of the user interface
now to make it more understandable
consider the Facebook homepage the
entire you I can be broken down into
several elements say we have the
credentials component the signup
component the image component and the
logo component notice that each
component adds something to how the
homepage looks all right reusability is
one of the Salient features of react
components one component can be reused
several times across the application and
this improves the development speed
components can also be nested one
component can internally consist of
several other components in its animal
form a component must Define a render
method that specifies how exactly the
application looks and feels a component
can also receive properties from its
parent components also you'll get a
better understanding of all of these
when we start working Hands-On so don't
worry so moving on let's look at the
different types of components first we
have the stateless functional components
and then we have the stateful class
components now functional components are
typical JavaScript functions that return
HTML now they can be contained in ajs or
a jsx file coming to class components
these are regular ESX classes however
it's mandatory that they contain a
render method that in turn returns HTML
they can also be contained in JX or a
jsx file okay then let's go ahead and
build our first react application using
components all right so I've opened my
text editor that is VSS code to build my
application Also I suggest you watch the
react installation on Windows video to
help you get started the video briefly
explains how to install node and how to
start building your first react
application in my case I've opened a
folder called react component tutorial
and here in my source folder I have
app.js now app.js is the main component
that gets rendered to the domm let me
show you that here in index.js you pass
app.js which is a component that gets
rendered to the react Dom so app.js
consists of several other components
that can be nested so as you you can see
app.js is a functional component and
before moving on let me get rid of all
the unnecessary code so let me delete
all of this and return nh1 tag that says
hello welcome to Simply learn let me
save it and if you look at the browser
you'll have hello welcome to Simply
learn now let's go ahead and display
another message say H1 this video is
about
components right let me save it and let
me check the browser it gives you an
error so jsx uses a conventional rule
which states that all HTML tags have to
be enclosed within a div tag so for
example I say div and I enclose it so
let me save and check my browser again
here you go so multiple HTML tags have
to be enclosed within the div tag moving
on let's create a first functional
component to do that I'll first create a
f folder in my source folder say
components within that I'll create a
file say functional component.js all
right so the first thing we have to do
is import react so I say import react
from RE the general Syntax for a
functional component involves the
keyword function and say
functional component now you say return
and H1 tag or I've already used H1 tags
so I'll say paragraph and I say this is
a functional component all right before
explaining to you how these components
are exported and imported let me show
you the general Syntax for a class
component so I create another file say
class component.js I again import react
from react the general notation is using
the class keyword followed by the name
of the class extending from the base
class react. component so going ahead I
say class class component extends react
do component now the key feature of a
class component is the usage of a render
method so I say render within braces I
say return a paragraph tag saying this
is the class component all right so
moving on let's see how these components
can be nested into the main component
that is app.js comp components can be
nested into the main component using
Import and Export keywords so as the
name suggests export feature is used to
export a particular file or a module and
import is used to import a particular
file or a module into the current
existing module so we have two different
types of exports you have default export
and just export or named export so a
default export is used to export just
one object be it a function a class a
variable from the file and there can
only be one default export per file and
when you're importing it you can specify
the address and use the word import
before it so let me show you how it
works let's go back to our editor and
then functional component and here I say
export default and the name of the
functional component that is functional
comp so let me save this and going back
to my app.js I say import name of the
functional component that is functional
comp from and I pass the path this
components SL functional component also
let me get rid of these
unnecessary files here now let's define
functional component in our app.js
component so here I say functional comp
let's compile it and check our browser
here it says this is our functional
component moving on to my class
component it's the same syntax here as
well I say export default name of my
component and in my app.js I import it
import class comp From the Path and
again I'll have to to Define it in my
return method I say so let me compile it
and check my browser it says this is the
class component one unique feature of
default export is that I can rename the
file while I'm importing it so for
example I can rename it as say FC and
while I'm defining it I'll have to make
sure I use the same name and conventions
so I say FC again and when I check it it
says this is the functional component
there's literally no difference the next
type of export is the named export or
just export so a named export can be
used to export multiple objects be it
functions class Etc from a file now
there can be several named exports from
a single file one hack is that while
you're importing it cannot be renamed so
let me show you how this works okay so
let's create another class in our class
component so I'll just copy paste this
let me give it another name say class
comp one and the message that I want to
display is hey I'm another class all
right so when I exporting it I don't
want default so let me take it off and
say export here all right in my app.js
while importing it I want to import both
the classes so I'll include them within
curly braces here I say class comp comma
class comp one and then again I Define
it here class comp one let's compile it
and run it and here we go here you can
see hey I'm another class so we've
successfully exported both the classes
from the class component and imported it
back in our app.js component one
advantage of using named export is the
fact that I can choose to import the
classes that I want to now say for
example I do not want to import class
component here so let me take it off and
here let me comment this now let's
compile and see hey I'm another class
the second class got imported while the
first class I was defined earlier is not
imported here all right so next up we
have higher order and pure competence
now I won't get into the integrities of
it cuz they're Advanced topics but to
give you a brief Insight higher order
components are basically functions that
take in a component and return a new
component the whole ideology behind
higher order components is to facilitate
the reusability of component logic okay
so let's see how this works let's go
back to our code editor let's create a
component in our components folder let's
call the component
click. JS all right so here we define a
class I use this nippit rce here we go
we get the entire format using the small
snippet rce and here I'm going to make
use of a button now say I use the tag
button and I'll say clicked one time
every time the user clicks on the button
the value gets incremented so for this
I'm going to use a variable say count
and I'm going to use the concept of
States so let's go ahead and Define our
variable count and initialize it to zero
so for that I'm going to use another
snippet called R const and here this Dot
State equals my variable count
initializing it to zero so let's define
the count variable in a render method so
I say const count equals this do state
so every time we click on the button the
count value has to get incremented right
so we make use of an event called on
click equals this dot update click Now
update click is going to be another
method that we have to Define now so
every time time the button gets clicked
this method is called so let's go ahead
and Define the function so it is update
click equals is going to be an arrow
function and I say this do set state is
nothing but count this do state. count +
one okay and here we say count times all
right so once this is done let's import
our component in app.js so here again I
see say import click from components
click and let's define it here so let's
check our browser every time we click on
the button the value gets incremented
all right so let's go ahead and create
another component say counter. JS where
in every time the user hovers the mouse
on the button the count value increases
so let's go ahead and do that I say
counter. JS I'm again going to use the
snippet rce to create a class component
and here in my div tag I Define a button
and say incremented to for now I say x
so now let's go ahead and add the event
say button on Mouse enter I'm going to
call the method this do increment count
okay so once you're done with that let's
go ahead and Define the increment count
method I'm going to copy the same code
that I've mentioned in my click. Js so I
say copy this all right so one change is
that I'll change the name of the method
and call it increment count again let's
define the count in our render method so
I say const count equals this do state
and here I change X to count now let's
go ahead and import it in our app.js so
I say import counter
from components and counter and let's
Define it here all right let's save it
and let's run the code okay so as you
can see you see another button here
incremented to zero and every time I
move my cursor on the button it
increments mind you I'm not clicking I'm
just hovering my mouse okay to learn how
higher order components work we'll have
to pass counter. JS and click. JS as
parameters to give birth to an entire
new component so for that let's go ahead
and create another component for our
hocc let's call it
higher order. JS okay so I say import
react from react after that I say const
updated component equals original
component that's going to be an arrow
function again and within C braces I
Define my class that is class say new
component extends react do component
inside let's define a render method that
returns the original component with a
modification that is I want to type the
user I want to append the user before
the actual message is displayed all
right so let's go ahead and close the
tag and return new component and let's
export this say export default updated
component now we import higher order. JS
in our counter. JS and click. JS and
pass these components as parameters so
let's do that let's go to our counter.
JS and here I say
import updated component from do/ higher
order component and here while exporting
I say updated comp and pass this as my
parameter let's do the same to click. JS
here I import data com from higher order
component and here I pass this as a
parameter now here in our higher order
component we've defined a property name
and initialized it to the user so we'll
have to include this in our other
components that's counter and click so
let's do that and here right before
incremented to I say this do props do
name let me save it let me do the same
thing here and say this doprs do so if
you go back to our browser here you can
see it says the user click zero times
and the user incremented to zero okay so
this basically shows how react
Implements reusability of components
moving on our next topic is pure
components now another way to create
class component is by extending pure
component from react a pure component
avoids unnecessary renders now how does
it do it it does not implement the
should component update method now
you'll learn about this method a little
later in the video now this method
enables rendering of components to the
Dom but a pure component on the other
hand ensures a shallow comparison of
states and props and checks if a render
is actually necessary only then does it
render to the Dom a react component can
be considered pure if it renders the
same output for the same state and props
so let's take an example to explain pure
components so let's go back to our vs
code and create two component classes
one for a regular component and the
other for a pure component Now using
this example I'll show you exactly how
pure component is more helpful okay so
let's create a pure component.js file I
say pure comp JS so here I'm going to
use a snippet rpce that is going to
create a pure component class let me get
rid of this export and here in my div
tag I'll display the text say I'm the
pure component all right now let's go
ahead and create a regular component let
me call it regular component.js and here
I'm going to use the snippet rce and the
message that I'd want to display is I'm
the regular component so to draw
comparison between the regular component
and the pure component let's create a
parent component for the two so let me
create one here I'll call it parent
component.js and this is again going to
be a regular class component and here I
display the message I'm am the parent
component to change the state of the
component we're going to make use of a
Constructor so let's use the snippet R
const and here let me create name you
can give anything and I say simply learn
now we make use of the component did
Mount life cycle method to set a time
interval now don't worry about this
we're going to learn about it a little
later in the video so moving ahead I'm
going to make use of the method and say
component did Mount and here I say set
interval the first argument is going to
be an arrow function and the second will
be the time interval and I'm going to be
setting it to 3 seconds now within the
arrow function I'll make use of the set
State function to set the state of my
property
however I do not change the name I keep
it simply on itself moving on let's
import pure component and the regular
component into our parent component and
then pass name as a property so to do
that first import pure comp from Pure
component and then I say import regular
comp from regular comp. JS and here
let's say regular comp name equals this
do state do name and I say pure
component name equals this do state.
name now let's include the property name
in both our regular and pure components
so to do that let's just say this do
prop. name and here I again say this.
prop. name and finally let's import
parent component into our app.js
component so here I say import parent
com from okay and here let me Define
parent comp so now if you look at the
browser we have I'm the parent I'm
regular component simply learn and I'm
the pure component simply learn we've
got the result as expected now to check
if the pure component is actually
rendering or not let's include simple
console. log statements so here I say
CLG snippet and here I say pure
component render and in my regular
component I do the same thing I say
console.log regular component render now
let's do the same in our parent
component as well here I say parent
component render all right so let's go
back to our browser and inspect it in
our console first the parent component
gets rendered then the regular component
and then the pure component after that
for every 3 seconds only the parent
component and the regular component is
rendered for the same state and prop the
pure component component is not rendered
so in conclusion pure components
optimize react codes and also improves
performance so coming to the last topic
component life cycle so basically
component life cycle explains the stages
the component goes through the entire
life cycle of a component can be divided
into three parts we have mounting
updation and unmounting so the first
thing that gets invoked in the life
cycle is component will mount it is
invoked right before the initial
rendering occurs then we have the
rendering method now once a component is
inserted into the domor component did
Mount gets involved coming to the next
phase we have updation when a component
receives props component will receive
props gets invoked set state is called
when the state of the property changes
so every time there is a change react
decides whether the next component State
Should trigger a rerender or not to do
that should component update method is
called component will update is invoked
right before rendering after rendering
component did update is called that
makes updates to the domor and the last
phase is unmounting component will
unmount method does all the necessary
cleanup and erases all the allocated
memory and Cycles in our previous video
we learned about reactjs components in
detail and now moving ahead let's learn
about another striking feature of
reactjs called props props short for
properties allow the user to pass
arguments or data to components a
pairing component can pass additional
information to its children using props
properties help make components more
Dynamic props are passed to components
in the way similar to that of HTML track
attributes now we'll look at this a
little later in the video props in a
component are read only and cannot be
changed one thing to remember is that
props are sent by the parent to the
children components hence the children
components cannot make any changes to
these props now that we've learned about
props in brief let's go ahead and create
our application using props if you're
new to this tutorial I suggest you go to
the react installation and react
components video on our channel so back
in my code editor that is vs code I've
opened a folder called react props and
now I'm going to create a component a
class component and I'll call it class
props do JS so let's create the class
component I give rce the snippet and
here I display a message saying an H1
tag
basically all right
now let me get rid of export here and
import it in my app.js main component
here I say
import class
props all right now we Define the class
component in our render
method let's
say all
right now if you go back to the browser
you see Hello Learners welcome to Simply
learn now let's say we want to
individually welcome every student
instead of retyping the message for
everybody we can pass their names as
props now let's see how to do that now
we pass the name as a property from the
main component that is app.js to the
child component and render this onto the
browser so let's do that so here while
I'm defining my child component I say
name I save it and here in my child
component instead of learners
I say I use the keyword
this. props do
name let me save it and if you look at
the browser we'll have hello learner one
welcome to Simply learn now let's go
ahead and welcome learner 2 and learner
3 so I again say class props name
equals learner
2 all right so if we save and look at
the browser we'll have all the three
Learners displayed on the browser we can
also pass multiple props to the child
component now say for example we want to
welcome the student from a particular
place so we say welcome learner one from
Place X so I can here Define another
property say
place and say Place similarly I can do
it for the rest too say Place y
now let's go back to our class props JS
component and here say hello learner one
from this. props
dopl let me save it and if you look at
the browser now we have hello learner
one from Place X Place Y and place Zed
we can also display whatever we want
between the opening and closing tags
when invoking a component now this is
facilitated using props do children
Reserve keyword now let me explain to
you how it's done with an example here
let's split the self enclosing tag into
an opening and a closing tag and in
between them let me display a message
within the paragraph tag let me
say and in my child component after my
H1 tag let me use a paragraph tag and
here let's use the reserved keyword this
do props do
children so let's save it and now if you
look at the browser you can here see the
message displayed child component so
Props do children can be used when
components do not know about their
children ahead of time this is commonly
seen in components like sidebar and
dialogue that represent generic boxes so
let's go ahead and create a button tag
and check again so here I'll split it
and add a button tag
and say
click and let's check our
browser here we go we get the output as
expected all right we saw the usage of
props for class components similarly we
can use it for functional components so
let's go ahead and create a functional
component let me call
it I say import react from
react and then I say
function function Pro
pops and here I return in H3
tag I'll say this is functional
component and I'll return another H3 tag
saying hello
learner so let me save this and let's
export it export
default function
props and import it in our app.js again
import function prop
from function
prop and here in our render method let's
define it let me call function prop name
let me give learner
4 and
place place c a
let me close it and back in our
functional component instead of learner
I
say props do name let me save it now if
you look at our browser it gives us an
error it says props is not defined so
let's go back to our code editor and
pass props here to our functional
component also let me Define hello props
do
name from
props do
place let me enclose it within the div
tag
[Music]
here let me save it and now if you look
at our browser here we go we get the
output as expected so let's begin and
learn what exactly is a state in react
typically a state is an object that
stores the values of properties
belonging to a component now these
values can change over a period of time
either via user interactions or network
changes and the state helps facilitate
this functionality every time the state
changes react rerenders the component to
the browser the state is initialized in
the Constructor a state can also store
multiple properties a method called set
state is used to update the value of the
state object now this function performs
a shallow merge on the new and the
previous state conventionally a shallow
merge ensures that the previous state
values are overwritten by the new state
values moving on in our previous video
we learned about about props and
although props and state dictate and
control the behavior of a component they
have significant differences so let's go
ahead and draw a comparison between the
two firstly props in a component are
used to pass data and event handlers to
its children while State on the other
hand is used to store the data that has
to be rendered on the web page props are
immutable once set by the parent they
cannot be changed State holds volatile
data and can be changed over time props
can be used in functional and class
components while state is restricted to
class components props are set by the
parent component while a state is
generally updated by event handlers now
that we've learned all about State let's
go ahead and build an application to see
the working of State all right so in my
code editor that is vs code I've created
my application say State and here in my
source folder I have my app.js file now
here I'm going to get rid of all the
unnecessary code that I'm not going to
be using Also I suggest you go through
the react installation on Windows video
to help help you get started with
creating your first application so let's
create our class component say class app
extends react. component and inside I
have a render method that returns an
HTML tag let's display a message
welcome let's follow the jsx conventions
and enclose all the HTML tags within the
div tag so I say div class name equals
app we also have to import the app. CSS
file import app. CSS and so we save it
and if you look at the browser we have
welcome now let's beautify our code to
do that let's add some styling so here
in my app.js class component I say
Styles equals and I say font style and I
set it to say bold and I say color say
teal and here in my H1 tag
I say style equals this dot Styles so
let me save it and if we look at the
browser now we have welcome in teal and
it's bold now let's go ahead and create
a class component to understand state so
first I create a folder and I call it
components and inside this folder I
create a class component and I call it
new comp. Js and I use the snippet rce
to create the class component to give
you an insight into what we're doing
today we'll display a message asking the
user to subscribe to Simply learn once
the user clicks on the Subscribe button
we instruct them to click on the Bell
icon and finally we display a thank you
message now to do all of this we're
going to make use of state and as
mentioned earlier we initialize the
state object in a Constructor so let's
use the snippet R const to create a
Constructor now in the state object we
initialize a property let's call it
message and we display a message saying
subscribe to Simply learn let's save it
and here in our render method let's say
class name equals app and let's create
an H3 tag and within the tag I'll
display the message so I say this do
state. message let's save it and now
let's import it in our app.js component
so I get rid of export here and here I
say import new comp from components and
new comp and let's define it here and
say new so we save it and look at the
browser it says subscribe to Simply
learn all right again to make our code
look more presentable let's add in
Styles so I'll just copy the same styles
that I've added here and I'll paste them
here and instead of bold I make it
italic and I change the color to say
purple and again in my H3 tag I Define
style and initialize it to this. Styles
so let me save it and now if you look at
the browser it's in italic and it's in
purple okay so moving ahead let's create
a button that reads subscribe and once
the user clicks on it the button should
read subscribed and the message
displayed above should instruct the user
to click on the Bell icon to do that
let's first create a button the message
that I want the button to read is
subscribe however this message gets
changed once the user clicks on the
button so instead of explicitly
mentioning subscribe here I create a
prop I say sub and I say subscribe here
and back in my render method I say
this.state do sub so let's save it and
if you look at the browser now you have
a button which displays a message
subscribe now once the user clicks on
the button the message displayed should
to change to click on the Bell icon to
never miss an update so let's create an
event handler for that so here button on
click I call another method and let's
call the method button change okay so
this method should update the state and
change the message and sub values to do
that we make use of a set State method
now a state can be updated in response
to event handlers server responses or
prop changes now all the updation can be
done using the set State method this is
the general syntax used by the method
we'll however look at this further in
the demo now the set State method
conventionally enqs all the updates made
to the component State and instructs
react to rerender the component and its
children with the updated State now
let's go back to our code editor and
look at the working of this method now
here I defined the arrow function button
change if you are not familiar with
arrow functions I suggest you read up on
them and this is the general syntax and
here I say this do set State and inside
I change my message to hit the Bell icon
to never miss an update and my sub value
changes to subscribed let's save this
and now if you look at the browser when
we click on the Subscribe button the
message changes to hit the Bell icon to
never miss an update so moving ahead
let's use a Bell icon so that the user
can click on it once he clicks on the
image the image changes and a thank you
message appears on the screen so for
that I have two images I have Bell a and
Bell B so I drag and drop both the
images in my components folder all right
now let's import these images into our
new comp. Js file here I say import Bell
a from Bell
a.png and again I say import Bell B from
bb. PNG let me save it to display the
image on the screen we make use of the
image tag now this tag has two
attributes one is the source attribute
that specifies the URL and the other is
the alt attribute that specifies an
alternate text for the image so here in
my component I say I make use of a
paragraph tag that will help display the
image in the next line and then I use
the image tag now since my image changes
once it's clicked I have to define a
property and pass the event handler
click that will update the image so here
before specifying The Source let's go
back to our state and Define another
property that is image URL and let's set
it to Bell a since that is the image
that I want to display first let me save
it and here in my image tag I say Source
equals this do state do image URL and
then we have the all tag and I do not
want to display any message so I leave
it as it is now let's save it and if you
look at the browser we have a bell
displayed however now let's change the
dimensions of the bell I do not want
such a huge bell so back in my vs code I
Define style with width say 30 pixels
and a height with again 30 pixels let me
save this and now if you look at the
browser we have a smaller icon so once
the user clicks on this image the image
changes and the message displayed here
gets updated to do that we'll have to
Define an event so let's go back to our
vs code and here in my image tag let's
say on click I Define a method say this
do image change and now we Define this
method here I say image change I make
use of an arrow function again and again
I use the set State method I update the
image so I say image URL is now set to
Bell B and the message is updated to
thank you happy
learning so let's save this now and if
we look at the browser we see the image
and once clicked on it the image gets
updated and the message changes so
finally Let me refresh the browser once
and show the full execution Let me
refresh following the instructions let's
click on the Subscribe button and now it
says hit the Bell icon and once I do
that the image updates and the message
changes so what exactly is node.js now
consider a scenario where a user
interacts with the web application the
user only interacts with the front end
of the application but there's a lot of
work that goes behind the scenes now in
a web application there's a front end a
server and a database the front end is
developed using JavaScript and
Frameworks like angular and react while
the server is built on Java PHP or no JS
and the backend database that stores the
data usually consist of MySQL or mongodb
so nodejs is an open source
crossplatform JavaScript runtime
environment for running serers side
applications it is used to develop IO
intensive web applications like video
streaming sites single page applications
online chatting applications and other
web applications it is used by large
established companies and newly minted
startups nodejs was developed by Ryan D
in 2009 and at the same time of this
session its latest version is v13.30 now
that we know what nodejs is let's go
ahead and look at why it was so
prevalent in the field of web
development here are a few points first
up node.js is extremely fast being built
on Google Chrome's VA JavaScript engine
its library is extremely fast in code
execution not package manager has around
50,000 bundles for developers so
whatever functionality is required for
an application can be easily imported
from npm all apis of nodejs Library are
asynchronous that is non-blocking it
means a node.js based server never waits
for an API to return data nodejs
dramatically reduces the processing time
while uploading video and audio files it
is also an open source platform and is
easy for beginners for web development
the above reasons more than justify the
popularity of nodejs platform and why it
is being adopted by large number of
organizations and businesses today so
now moving on let's familiarize
ourselves with the parts of node.js
nodejs consists of several components
now let's look at them one by one first
up we have modules now modules are like
JavaScript libraries which are used in a
nodejs application to include a set of
functions now we can use required
function with the parenthesis to include
a module in a node.js application nodejs
application has many modules to provide
basic functionality needed for a web
application some of them could be HTTP
util FS URL query string stream and ZB
next up we have console the console
module provides a simple debugging
console that is similar to the
JavaScript console mechanism provided by
web browsers now the console can print
messages to STD out that print standard
output messages and STD air to print the
error messages the next component is
cluster now nodejs is built upon the
concept of single threading programming
a single instance of nodejs runs in a
single thread to take advantage of
multicore systems the user will
sometimes want to launch a cluster of
nodejs processes to handle the load a
cluster can be added to an application
in this way here's a small code for you
the next component is global now global
objects in nodejs are available in all
modules now these objects are functions
modules strings Etc some nodejs Global
objects are mentioned in the table you
have dir name that is a directory name
file name exports module and require the
next component is error handling now
nodejs applications experience four
types of error we have the standard
JavaScript errors system errors user
specific errors and assertion errors now
errors in nodejs and handled through
exceptions now for example let's handle
an error that would occur when we divide
a number by zero now this error would
crash the noj application and so we
should handle this error here's a small
code for you next up we have streaming a
stream is an abstract interface for
working with streaming data in nodejs
streams are objects that let you read
data or write data continuously there
are four types of streams first one is
the readable these are the types of
streams from which data can be read
writeable these are the types of streams
to which data can be written duplex
these are both readable and writable
streams lastly we have transform these
streams can manipulate the data while it
is being read or written moving on to
the next component buffer the JavaScript
language has no mechanism for reading or
manipulating streams of binary data
buffer is a module that allows handling
stream that contain only binary data an
empty buffer of length 10 can be created
by this method next up we have domain
domains provide a way to handle
different IO operations as a single
group domain module intercepts errors
that remain unhandled there are two
types of methods that are used for
intercepting these errors firstly we
have internal binding in this case the
error emit executes its code inside the
error method next up is the external
binding now here the error emitter is
explicitly added to a domain via add
method the next component is the DNS the
DNS module enables name resolution for
example it is used to look up the IP
addresses of host names DNS module is
used to connect to a DNS server and
perform name resolution by using the
method DNS do resolve the DNS module is
also used for performing name resolution
without a network communication by using
the method DNS do lookup the next
component is a debugger nodejs includes
an outof process debugging utility
accessible via a V8 and inspector and
built-in debugging client this node.js
debugger is not feature packed but
supports simple inspection of code it
can be used in the terminal by using the
inspect keyword before the name of the
Javascript file in order to inspect a
file say myscript .js you can use the
following method now that we are
familiar with all the major parts of
node.js let's go ahead and learn about
the nodejs Express framework Express is
a flexible nodejs web application
framework that provides a wide set of
features to develop both web and mobile
applications you can assume Express as a
layer built on top of the node.js that
helps manage the server and The Roots
now let's have a quick look at some of
the core features of Express framework
it is used to design single page
multi-page and hybrid web applications
it allows setting up of middleware to
respond to http requests it defines a
routing table that is used to perform
different actions based on the HTTP
method and URL it also allows Dynamic
rendering of HTML Pages based on passing
arguments to templates now moving on
let's take a quick example of a simple
hello world program now this is
developed using Express framework to
gain a better understanding all right
first up we have the we express now this
is used to import Express framework into
our nodejs application now the app.get
method is a callback function with
parameters request and response the
request object represents the HTTP
request and has properties for the
request query string parameters body
HTTP headers Etc the response object
represents the http HP response that an
Express app sends when it gets an HTTP
request now the application will listen
to the defined Port which in this case
is 8081 and variables host and Port will
contain the address and the port
respectively lastly we have the
console.log which is used to show the
address and port in the command prompt
so this is what the command prompt would
look like and finally the output is
displayed on the web browser Having
learned about the Express framework now
let's move on and look at the nodejs use
cases now it is no doubt that node
stands out for its speed and intensive
data exchange so top industry leaders
like NASA PayPal Netflix among others
incorporate nodejs first up we have
Netflix the world's leading internet
television network with over7 million
users is one of the top companies that
trusted their services to node.js the
reasons why the company chose to use
node.js were application scalability and
data intensive application now you must
be wondering what application
scalability is was basically the
potential of an application to grow in
time being able to efficiently handle
more and more requests per minute and
data intensive application allows
millions of people to stream Netflix
simultaneously next up is Walmart now
Walmart is the world's largest company
by Revenue with around $514 billion US
according to the fortune Global 500 list
in 2019 again the reasons why the
company chose no JS were asynchronous IO
and efficient handling of concurent
requests now asynchronous IO which is a
form of input output processing allows
other processing to continue before the
transmission has finished no JS is able
to efficiently handle concurrent
requests with the use of thread pool and
event cues Uber Uber is an American
multinational ride hailing company
offering services that include
peer-to-peer right sharing right service
healing and food delivery the reasons
why the company chose no JS were
asynchronous IO quick iterations and
active open- Source Community as
mentioned earlier asynchronous IO
permits other processing to continue
before the transmission has finished now
quick iterations now nodejs is
continually being updated and added new
features that help in further
Improvement in the performance of web
servers and finally active open source
Community resolves many problems that an
organization May face in a particular
scenario next up we have NASA now NASA
is an independent agency of the United
States federal government responsible
for the civilian space program as well
as Aeronautics and Aerospace research
the reasons why the company chose no JS
were reduced access times handling of
data intensive tasks and the fact that
the servers are active 24/7 now NASA has
lots and lots of data and using node.js
has really helped them in reducing the
access times it is also continuously
handling and working with large streams
of data nodejs is highly stable which
helps in keeping the server active 24/7
next up we have PayPal now PayPal is an
American company operating a worldwide
online payment system that supports
online money transfers as opposed to
traditional methods like checks and
money orders the reasons why the company
chose to use nodejs were the fact that
node.js has extremely fast build times
it allows tasks to be carried out with
fewer lines of code when compared to
other server Technologies like Java and
PHP and no JS being data intensive
efficiently handles a large amount of
data next up is medium medium is a
popular online publishing platform
developed by Evan Williams and launched
in August 2012 the main reasons why the
company chose to use nodejs were a data
driven applications now these
applications are ideal for being
interfaced with no JS servers B to run
AB tests now AB testing is essentially
an experiment where two or more variants
of a page are shown to users at random
and statistical analysis is used to
determine which variation performs
better lastly no JS server maintenance
is simpler than its counterparts moving
on to the last topic of this session
industry Trends now know developers are
in demand across the globe since many
companies are adopting JavaScript
libraries according to fobes it is one
of the top 10 most in demand jobs
according to note Source the total
number of nodejs downloads increased by
40% in the last 1 year the use of
node.js in production has increased
dramatically since it release in 2010
with early adopters such as linkon
PayPal and Netflix among others nodejs
has seen an exponential increase in its
use in web development velopment the
popularity of nodejs is also accounted
to JavaScript now since JavaScript is
the most popular language as evident
from a survey conducted by stack
Overflow in 2019 many developers can
start working on nodejs library with not
much of a learning curve nodejs
developers are being offered better
salary options than other web technology
developers according to pay scale the
average salary of a node.js developer in
India is around
63,000 rupees per year the average
salary of for nodejs developer across
the United States is around
$105,000 us per year in this video we'll
help you install node.js on your Windows
system so without further Ado let's
begin the first thing you need to do is
download nodejs from their official
website so go ahead and type download
nodejs navigate to their official
website and here you can see the 64-bit
version so go ahead and download that
once the download is done go ahead and
run the downloaded nodejs
installer accept the license agreement
keep the default settings as it
is and then say
install so with that we finished the
installation
process once node has been successfully
installed the next crucial step is
verification now this process ensures
that node has been properly installed to
do so we first open the command prompt
and then type in a few commands to
verify the successful installation we
type in this command node hyphen V now
this command Returns the version and if
it Returns the version it means it has
been successfully installed so here we
go it Returns the latest version now the
final step is to update the node package
manager now this npm is bundled with
nodejs which consists of all the
repositories and pack packages required
for development purposes so to do that
type in the command
npm install
npm hyphen hyphen Global now that we're
done with the installation of node let's
go ahead and Implement a small program
for that we make use of a text editor in
our case we've installed VSS code so go
ahead and download vs code once you're
done with the installation this is what
vs code looks like so go ahead and click
on file and create a new file it's it's
going to be a simple program where
you're going to print a hello world
message on the web browser to do that we
make use of HTTP modules so node comes
with built-in HTTP modules to transfer
data across it so for that we make use
of a required method we create a
variable first say V HTTP equals
required and just say HTTP within single
codes now the HTTP module can create an
HTTP server that listens to the server
ports and gives a response back back to
the client to do that we make use of the
create server method so let's go ahead
and type the
code say
HTTP do
create server and internally it consist
of a function now the parameters to this
function are request and response now
the response is basically used to write
to the client so we say response. write
and here we type in the message say
hello world
welcome to this
tutorial once you're done with that you
end the
response so the server listens to a port
number to display the message by default
it listens to the port number 8080 so we
keep that as it is and we end it save
your file say demo. JS maybe demo 1js
and say save now to run the program you
have to open the command prompt so open
your command
prompt and mention the path to your file
so in our case it's our desk sa on the
desktop so
CD desktop and now to run it say node
demo 1. JS now you navigate to your
browser and say Local Host 8080 and here
we go our message is successfully
displayed so let's talk about the
node.js architecture and understand why
it it's so good so to begin with uh
node.js has what's called a
single-threaded event Loop architecture
and this allows you to be able to handle
many many concurrent clients at the same
time it's just a very flexible way of
being able to scale up your support for
many uh
clients and then in addition to that we
have the JavaScript event based model
along with a JavaScript callback
mechanism that allows you have this
standard approach to being able to
connect with and talk and discuss
interactions between the client and the
server it's good to have these kind of
Standards where you're not using
something that's unique to a specific
framework or a specific technology this
just makes it so it's more accessible
for
everybody so if we'll look at the actual
node.js server itself everything centers
around the the concept of the event Loop
and the event Loop has a a an event
queue an operation completed um fire
request threaded pull and then it
actually do the actual computation or
the file system
interaction all of this interconnects in
a nice seamless Loop the great thing
again with nodejs is that it's not new
technology it's been around for almost a
decade it's very very well tried out
many of the largest websites out there
are running nodejs
so let's now dig into each of the parts
of the nodejs architecture so let's talk
about
requests so the way that the request
works is that you have your framework uh
such as angular on the client and that
will then send a request to the web
server and there's many ways that those
requests can happen through web workers
through forms and through other
interactions but at some point a request
is sent to the server
and so these requests can be for data
they can be for deleting data they can
be for updating data they can be for
interacting with Services as mentioned
before but the goal is to have some kind
of request now once that request
actually hits the server and then we
start actually getting into the queuing
and threading process that centers
around the event Loop and this is where
no GS really excels because it's able to
use that single-threaded model to be
able to manage from just even a few
requests to tens of millions of
requests so it receives the actual
request and starts the event queue and
this is where that single threading
process starts is by queuing everything
up
appropriately and then it then maintains
the thread within a pool so you have the
queuing process as one action and then
you have a threaded pull which manages
those um threads as well and then we
have an event Loop which you know goes
through and actually receives and
processes those requests and then
finally what we're doing is we're
actually then going to be interacting
with a system and that could be a
database it could be a cloud system it
could be an API file system but we're
interacting with something that's
outside of the node.js server so the
nodejs server itself is doing some
actions on the server but then it's also
interact with things outside of its own
server envir enironment and so let's
talk a little bit about that workflow so
requests come in they go into the event
queue and they get spiraled through the
event Loop and then we have a
non-blocking operators which are going
to be doing the input output polling uh
such as KQ eole and other services and
from there we're also going to be then
interacting with the threaded pull and
we're using the blocking operations to
manage that threaded pull and that
threaded pull is going to now then go
outside of the server and interact with
something beyond the server so whether
that is a database or file system or API
or micros service these are things that
can be interacted with so let's go
through what mpm is uh so mpm itself
stands for the node package manager no
uh great shakes there as the name says
it's responsible for all the packages
and modules that are bundled within
nodejs so the no packet manager itself
really has two key functional now the
first is that reply it is a central
repository for all packages and modules
which you can then search through um
online you can go to search. nodejs.org
and you can find all of the packages and
modules that are out there um the second
is that it's also a command line or
terminal uh line utility that allows you
to install those packages so you can
actually go through and you can see the
version management and dependencies
within those packages and you can
actually control the pack packages
themselves so why would you use
npm so mpm is really useful for being
able to extend the project you're
working on so when you're building out a
project one of the concepts I like to
use is the concept of Lego bricks um big
fan of Lego and uh what's great about
Lego bricks is that they're all
individually by themselves very small
very specific functionality um but if
you actually get a whole collection of
Lego bricks together you can build like
crazy cool things so think of when
you're working with the node package
manager itself is that each of those
individual pieces that you're working
with um each of those individual
packages are their own Lego bricks and
by themselves you can then edit and
update and maintain that piece um
separately from the whole environment as
long as your inputs and outputs you know
really the piece where you snap the Lego
in or when you connect the Lego to
something else um are interacted and
open and well documented then you can
actually then use those modules
effectively throughout your
project um so you can actually then be
able to do that you can do Version
Control on your codes and dependencies
you can do testing very
easily and then once you actually get to
the point where you go yes I want to
release um a new module you can do that
effectively using mpm and it will
actually go through and do the actual
deployment for
you so let's go through the mpm
installation
so the actual package manager itself is
included with the installation of nodejs
so if you've installed and you're
running node.js uh locally then you've
already installed the package manager uh
but you can also access it through
command line or terminal window um on
your your data server or in your soft
Farm or via the
cloud uh if you haven't downloaded
node.js uh here's the website where you
can go down to install it and there's
Windows and Mac versions of that uh code
as well with the installers allow you to
get up and going very
quickly uh you want to be able to run
the installer and accept all the default
settings uh just um you know to begin
with you want to kind of have the
standard setup so that you are most
familiar with the normal settings before
you start getting to the point where
you're a master and you're tweaking
things um there is a way that you can
open up the command window or The
Terminal window and uh once you've
actually installed nodejs um to verify
that uh it's actually installed you can
write the command node-- version and
it'll let you then pull out the version
of nodejs that you have installed and
then you'll be able to see that you got
actually up and
running and then you can also do the
same thing for mpm you can go mpm Das
Das vers and it actually will then show
you which version of the node package
manager you have running so you can
actually take a full advantage of that
program and verify that it's actually up
and running now we're actually going to
go ahead and actually run a demo of
using mpm and to do that I've got three
windows in front of me right now so I
have this window here which is my
terminal window uh where I'll be doing
all of my instructions uh then I also
have a folder which shows where I'll be
putting all of the files and then
finally I'll actually have a text editor
in this case I'm using vs code because
it's free um but you can use any text
edit you like to be able to go in and
show what the uh code that's been
created by mpm in the Json file so you
can actually see what it looks like um
and then we'll modify it a little bit so
first thing we want to do is we want to
go ahead and uh create a uh new project
folder so I'm going to go in I'm just
going to move into do change directory
and go into the project folder and we'll
see down here that we have an anti
project folder um but for this one I'm
actually going to go ahead and I'm going
to create a new directory in this one
one and I'm going to call this one uh
simply
learn and there we are we've created a
new simply Lear
folder and we are going to move into the
simply learn
folder and so we're now in the simply
learn folder uh there's nothing in there
right now um so the first thing we want
to do is we want to take H go ahead and
initialize this folder as a project
folder for working with mpm now to do
this you will have to have already
installed mpm if you have no JS mpm
comes with it um and if you want to see
whether or not you have mpm installed so
you can just do mpm das
version and that will actually tell you
what the version of mpm you have
installed is and it also verifies that
mpm is installed so I've gone ahead and
I've been able to validate that I have
mpm installed so what I'm now going to
go ahead and do is I'm going to
initialize this folder so to do that you
just do mpm in it and you'll see that
the par is that were're already in the
simply L folder and then when you do
that it's going to ask you some
questions so what is the package name
we're going to go with the defaults for
right now and then I can show you how we
can edit those in a little bit uh we're
going to go with just say yes to all of
these just by hitting
return and you'll see here that we're
going to create a new folder called a
package.json folder this is the
instructions that we have in the folder
do we want to go ahead and create this
we want to and it's going to go ahead
and do that and we can see now in our um
folder here that we actually have
package.json so we go ahead and open
this up
with vs code here we are we can actually
see what all of the information is we
can go ahead and we can actually go and
update uh this metadata if we want to
I'm going to leave it as is for right
now because I want to show you a couple
of other things so a lot of times when
you're actually working uh with mpm and
the reason why you're using mpm is that
you want to take advantage of packages
that are freely available in the open
source community that are supported by
node.js and one of those is a package
called Express and express is a like
weight framework for building out uh web
applications similar in concept uh to
angular or
reactjs um I like using it and it's also
a great way to be able to show how we
can U install this using mpm so to
install this uh you just start with the
command mpm and then you type
install and then we type the name of the
package and we hit enter and it goes
ahead and what you'll actually
see is a couple of things one is we have
a dependency in our package bath uh we
also have uh so this is in our Json
package that it's now dependency that's
written in there uh we can also go in
and under our node modules we actually
see that we have we scroll down we
should see
Express there it is Express
now if we decide that we don't want to
use um Express we can actually just come
in and we can write command npm
uninstall back in
type
Express Oops I did a typo there so let's
try that again
npm
uninstall Express
and couple things going to happen one is
uh in our Json file the dependency for
the express file has now been
removed and we can also see that under
our node modules there are no extensions
there so this is kind of cool this
allows us to be able to see um that we
can uh easily add and remove
packages uh so let's just go ahead and
I'm going to install expr Express again
so install
Express oops mpm install
Express all right so it's gone ahead and
it's installed
Express now one of the things that often
happen is that when you're working with
a package the actual Json um package so
you'll receive uh this
file and you want to be able to go go
ahead and uh install all the um sub
modules that come with it so and you can
go through you can man install them like
this or you can actually run an install
command so you can actually install all
of them at once I can just show you what
that looks like because we're going to
actually go ahead and simulate as if
we're going to install bootstrap which
is
another uh popular framework
strip and we're actually going to go
with and we'll save
that and what we'll see is under the
packages that bootstrap isn't listed in
there we do have Express there it is
right
there so we now come over to our new
command so we can actually write the
command and npm
install and
[Music]
now sight typo let's try that
again let's do
npm install
okay it does help to save your file so
let's go ahead and let's run npm
install and when you do that what we'll
now actually have is not just Express
but we'll also see that bootstrap has
also been
added now I don't recommend that you use
the uh star symbol which will install
the latest version of bootstrap because
you obviously haven't tested your
application against that but it gives
you an idea of of what's happened here
now if we want to we can actually go in
here and we can see
unin
install
bootstrap and it will actually remove
that from your Json package so there we
are that's how you work with using mpm
from getting started with a uh setup for
a base uh initialization of your uh
package going through to creating the
first package um being able to set up
and control the naming convention for
each of the items within the metadata
that provides the instruction for uh the
package how you can then put in
dependencies such as Express and
bootstrap how you can install them and
remove them and actually use do all of
this through command line if you haven't
any questions yeah please let us
know Jango is a popular framework
nowadays and you must have heard it
almost every websites and web
applications uses Django in somewhere or
other for their web development so in
today's session we'll discuss what is
Jango framework let's start by
discussing what is a web
framework a web framework is a software
framework that is created to support the
development of dynamic sites web
services and web applications it
supports creation development and
Publishing of the applications and
websites hi guys I'm Angeli from Simply
learn now if you have been following our
playlist on python by now you have
probably completed all the basic
concepts of python so today we'll use
these basic concepts in creating a
website using python again now this
application is called D Jango and before
we move into actually developing the
website let's better understand what
Jango is so Jango is a highlevel python
web framework so when you compare Jango
to to many of its other counterparts
such as flask which also uses python it
provides very limited freedom but then
again this limited Freedom does mean
that it makes development much faster
and that is the goal of D Jango so if
you're a complete beginner with web
development and also sort off with
python this is the place to start so
Jango has a free and a paid version but
since we just learning how it works we
can go for the free version in fact the
paid version is only required when it's
utilized by companies where they perform
a lot of modifications to the point that
it's actually unrecognizable now some of
the companies which are using Jango our
Instagram bitbucket Pinterest and even
NASA now there's another important thing
that we need to understand about Jango
which is it design pattern so Jango
follows the MTV design pattern where MTV
stands for model template view these
terms may seem very remot to you right
now and I don't think there'd be a point
of me explaining what they are as of now
so once we move on to the demo where
I'll be teaching you how you can create
the web framework we can better
understand how this design pattern works
and with that we finally ready to move
into actually creating our website so
there are certain prerequisits to Jango
to perform these open your command
prompt so the first thing we need to
ensure is that your system has python
installed now of course if you're
learning D Jango you probably already
know Python and for this purpose you
would have had python installed
previously itself we'll just check so
type in Python version and if you do
have python installed your version
number will appear here now the other
thing we need installed is PIP so once
again pip would also be installed on
your systems it comes with python itself
and so yeah I have Pip 19.0 point2
version now once those two things are
done we'll move on to a virtual
environment so a virtual environment is
basically this environment that we
create to isolate our application now
this is necessary in Django cuzz often
we make applications we have completely
built the application and now we do not
want to touch them we do not want to
create anything new we do not want to
update any packages that are already
being used so if you're creating a new
application for which you need to update
the packages we don't want the
implementation of that to hamper with
the implementation of our current
application so this is why we completely
isolate them so for that the first thing
you do is you need to install the
virtual environment wrapper we'll use
the PIP command to do so so pip install
virtual EnV wrapper so if you're using
any other system such as Linux systems
and then press enter but in case of
Windows put a dash and win which
signifies windows so I already have my
virtual environment installed so now we
have python we have our pip and we have
the virtual environment now let's create
a virtual environment so to create the
virtual environment type in MK virtual
EnV and the name for your virtual
environment so previously I had made a
virtual environment py1 this this time
I'll go with py2 and that should create
your environment so virtual environment
is created which is py2 and as soon as
it's created you'll notice that now your
commands start running in py Tu so when
you're creating an application the
application itself is not created at
this place it's just the environment
files that's stored in here so now all
this is done the final prerequisite is
of course to have our web framework we
need to install Jango so let's get to
that pip install Jango so now that
Django is installed we finally ready to
start our project so the command to run
to start your first project
django-admin start project and followed
by the name of your project so I'll just
name my project Django project so I just
cleared my screen now if you go to this
location where we created our project
you'll see the project folder is created
here and inside the folder there's yet
another folder with the same project
name and a manage file now this manage
file is usually what we will be running
to compile our programs and then within
the folder you have certain python files
so we'll open all this in our ID and
I'll be using py charm but you can go
ahead with any other python ID in fact
you can even use a notebook so you can
select your project from here the panel
on the left or you can opt for open
browse through your folders and then
select your project so the project we
created just now is the Jango project
which is this one one so I'll open it
and and your project will appear on the
left side panel here you can see within
it there's another folder with the same
project name and there's the manage.py
file now within this folder again
there's another folder do idea and then
there is the in it settings URL and the
wsgi file although we won't be making
changes on modifying any of these files
so we'll check out what these files are
one by one although we won't be making
modifications to most of them the idea
folder probably won't be existing in
your project you can completely ignore
that now we'll have a look at what each
of these python files do so the first
file which is the init file as you can
see it's empty the reason is that the
very presence of this file is only to
inir that this package here this is not
any ordinary folder it's a python
package so you don't really need any
content within this now the next file
that we have here is the settings file
so the settings file is the central
config ation file this is modified only
when your application goes into the real
world other than that we just leave it
as it is so some of the values that you
would be modifying is for example the
debug value now when the debug value is
true which in our case it is whenever an
error occurs in any of your code and
you're trying to run that page all the
errors appear on the page but now if you
are putting your website into the real
world you do not warn that all your
errors will be displayed on the page for
obviously security reasons so then you
can just change this value to false just
before you upload your page next you
have the URLs page as from the name it's
very clear the url's page is where you
have your url stored so basically this
file Maps the URL of a page to the
function that the page will be
performing so now you have the wsgi.py
code file so this page contains an
application callable which the
application server uses to communicate
with your code and finally we have the
manage.py page this is the page used to
interact with your project so we never
ever touch the manage.py page the
settings page does change when your
website goes into the real world the
URLs page we will be actually modifying
during the course of our project again
the wsgi.py page we leave it untouched
so now that you know the basics of what
each file already present does we can
start our demo so before we start coding
our website there's a dummy development
server which is provided with Django so
we'll just check that out first just go
to your command prom and move into the
path of your project and then you just
type python manage.py run server and as
you can see here the development server
has started and it's at Port 8,000 so go
to your browser open any browser of your
choice Local Host and at 8,000 port and
as you can see here since we have
installed our Jang J and we ran our
server so our Jango page has appeared
here and it says that our installation
worked successful so so far all good we
can now start building our project so
what website are we creating well I was
thinking of a very basic website where
you'll have the front page the first
page would have probably like three four
Jers and within each Jer you'll have a
piece that is an article a novel or even
a poem of that particular genre so the
user gets to click the joural on the
first page and the minute he or she does
so we move on to the next page where we
have our article within that Jal
displayed we'll also include a
registration page just to see how that
works with Jango so before we move on
guys I want to tell you that this
tutorial will completely concentrate on
how D Jango works so we will not look
much into the details of how our page is
displayed that is we won't go in depth
into HTML CSS and so on but rather just
stick to D Jango and its functionality
and another thing that we need to know
about D Jango before we start developing
is that every page in Jango is called an
app so when you go to a website say
Facebook for instance you have multiple
tabs right so there's a tab for the
profile you click on it and it
immediately takes you to your profile
now if this entire thing that is
Facebook was built on Jango then your
profile would be one app and then
there's another tab which takes you to
your messages the the page where all
your messages are displayed that would
be a second app so that's how D Jango
works every small thing every component
or every page of your website is an app
and you need to ensure that you can
describe exactly what an app does in one
or two sentences so a page should not
have multiple things happening on it if
a page is for displaying messages that
should be the sole purpose of the page
so yeah that's the basic of apps and how
they are a part of Django so how do we
create this app just open your command
prompt move on to the path where your
project is stored now in here you'll
type in the command to create your first
app so that's python manage.py start app
and then the name for your app so I'll
name my app genner so basically on my
first page I want all my Jers to be
displayed and every article is put under
a particular Jer hence the name enter
and your app should be created so I go
back to my pycharm and as you can see
here we have our app have genner created
in here now under this app there are
more number of files so what do these
files do we'll discuss that first well
first is our migrations folder now
inside this migration folder there'll be
a number of files which will be created
once we go through our project we'll see
every time we execute a particular
command a new file is inserted into the
migrations folder so this basically
connects your database with your source
code and that might seem very
complicated but actually Jango makes it
extremely easy and then you have the
admins page now this admin file or this
admin page that Jango provides is
extremely useful so it's like the Zumi
admin page where you can actually go and
you can view your entire database there
in a very formatted way you have all the
models that you created there you can
insert more values you can delete values
you can edit values which are already
present so right now the admin page will
not be existing there's no point of us
going and checking it right now since we
have not created any models yet again
what is models I'll come to that too so
that is the next file I'll be telling
you about now if you have gone through
objectoriented programming python or
Java or any other objectoriented
programming as a matter of fact you
probably know the concept of classes now
over here in our models file we create
classes and each of this class is
actually a model and by that we mean
it's a database so when we create a
class we have a number of attributes in
this class and each of this attribute
forms a column in our database so that
is what will be happening here and once
we create our class or what we call
model that is when we can actually view
the admin page and we'll see how this
page is extremely helpful the next
important page is the views page so guys
if you remember initially I told you
that Jango has a design pattern which is
the model view template where model is
already discussed they are the classes
template as you probably guest is the
look of the page so that's basically
your HTML files and what brings the
model and the template together that is
the view so view adds the functionality
now whenever you receive a request from
the user for a particular URL view will
describe the response for this request
but view is not responsible for giving
the response that is another file that
will be creating as you'll see in some
time so now when I go back to my web
page here there's no URL for this this
is is just a domain name but once we
start creating our websites the very
existence of each web page is linked to
a presence of a URL so that is exactly
where we'll start building under ajango
project folder we have this URLs page
there's already a URL path present here
it says admin which is as you guessed
it's the URL to the admin page that is
by default provided by Jango and over
here there's this another parameter so
what this parameter is it's the response
that that is to be given for the request
that you receive now just in this manner
we need to add the URL for our first
page which is going to be the Jers page
so I say path Jers and then in here I'll
insert the action so I've not created
any action yet so I don't know what to
put in there either as of now but guys
think about this so if our website has
10 pages does this mean that we'll have
10 different URLs going in here that
would be quite half aad wouldn't it so
we need need a more organized way of
doing this and for that very purpose we
will use Jers the app as our base app so
if from geners we are moving on to our
second page so say our geners has our
three geners which is fiction
inspiration and something else so the
user clicks on fiction and this
immediately takes the user to the second
page where the content in fiction is
displayed so then our second page should
be a sub page of genre in a way and
every the page that we move to from our
first page should be the same so for
this purpose what we can do is we'll go
to our Jers app the package we'll create
another URLs file within jna and in this
URLs file we'll Define the URL for our
second page with reference to our jer's
URL so how is that done well the first
thing you need to do is you must copy
paste this statement here into our URLs
page for this page we do not really need
to import include so I remove that part
out and I also need to Define my url's
pattern so copy paste this too but again
admin is already defined there
completely we do not require that now
here we'll see if the user wants the
page genners this is going to be my
first page that is my front page so what
will be the response to this the
response will obviously be defined in
our views page right now we have not
created anything in our views page but
we will soon and we will need name the
response for the URL Jers as index since
that is usually what the purpose of the
front page is it's usually to display
the index so we'll have view do index
and then following this we'll also give
a name to this very particular call and
the purpose of that I will explain later
just name this index for now it's not
view it's views and also we need to now
import views okay so we defined that if
the user goes to the page J
then we will be displaying whatever is
defined under views. index of course we
have not created that yet and we'll move
on to that in a while now the problem is
every request that is made by the user
the first thing Jango does is it checks
the URLs page under your main project
which is this page and under this page
we have not defined the action for Jers
and it would be very repetitive to
Define this again so what we do instead
is we just include the file where we did
Define the function for Jers and that is
jos. URLs so the user gives a request
for the jer's page D Jango checks out
this main url's page it sees it matches
the URL to this very particular pattern
here and for that it knows that the
response is to include the journal. URL
page so it includes this page and within
this page we of course have the function
or the response defined so now the next
thing is to create the response so now
under this views file we'll create a
view the first thing is we need to
import the HTTP package the request is
always HTTP and this time the response
that we are providing is also a HTTP
response we'll change this later cuz
we'll need a more defined response but
for now we'll stick to a very basic
display on our first web page so let's
import D Jango do HTTP import HTTP
response and now we can Define our
function which will tell what response
to provide for the particular URLs now
here we say that if the user gives a
request for this URL our response is
views. index So within views we need to
define a function named index So Def
index and this one takes request as a
parameter and returns a HTTP response
and that response could be a Simple Text
of course you can also have HTML tags
and just for the purpose of format
matting so that our text looks pretty
bold I'll put this into our header just
say hello world so that's done this is
the response that we'll be providing for
that particular URL now the thing is we
have this page here settings and in
settings if you scroll down you'll see
there's a list of apps which are
installed and in this list our app genre
is not mentioned so before we run our
server We'll add our app to this list so
that's done now go to your web page the
one where you you ran your Local Host
first and this time okay so my server is
not running I need to start my server
first type in your command python
manage.py run server and it says that
there's no issue and our server is
currently running so you go back to the
page where we ran a local host so the
last time we ran a local host currently
your page would still be on that if you
have not done any modifications I did a
few in between hence I got this page now
if you check out local post again you'll
see that there's an error this is
because now we started defining the URLs
in our URL page so when you don't give
any URL as such Jango checks out the two
URLs defined here and says hey what you
typed in here whatever your request was
does not match any of the URL patterns
so now we want to check out the journal
page and enter and as you see here hello
world is displayed so of course this is
a dummy page we need to do something way
more we need to create a web page and
that is what we'll get to okay so now
that we viewed our dummy web page the
next thing we need to do is actually
populate this app with some data now to
populate the app with data of course we
need to first store the data and that is
stored in a database so with d Jango you
would have probably already noticed here
there's this file called SQ light 3 so
this is the database management system
that comes along with d Jango it's
already set up to be used just a small
command a small tweak that we require
and everything will work perfectly fine
so what this does is basically all the
data that you enter through your model
will work along with this so that means
that there should be a communication
between your SQ light and your source
code now if I go back to the terminal
where I ran my server you'll see here
there's an error line which says you
have 15 unapplied migrations and your
project may not work properly right now
what we designed worked right because we
didn't have any data stored but from now
on we will be storing data so we need to
ensure that the migrations are done
right and by migrations we mean that our
database management that's site is
synced pretty well with our source code
so first of all stop your server and now
you run a command to do the syncing
which is python manage.py
migrate and as you hit this command the
syncing is happening so when you say
that the migration are complete what you
actually mean is when D Jango looks at
your installed apps this is an app that
we created and we just added it a while
back to this list of installed apps but
everything else in here in this list was
already present so these are some
default apps with Jango or this project
in particular will already work with and
many of these apps require to access
some databases it could not do that
until now but now that we finished our
migrations when Jango checks out these
apps and needs to run them them it can
easily access the database take whatever
data is required from there and perform
its functions again if we go back to a
command prompt and run the server again
you'll see that this time we do not get
the error of the unapplied migrations so
that is how you sync your database with
your source code now once we create our
models it means that we have added some
new classes there are some new tables
which are going to be added so again we
need to perform the migration function
which we'll look into later now let's
let's get to creating our classes so as
I mentioned earlier models are basically
classes now there are two classes that
we will be creating for this particular
project the first class will have all
the genners and the second class which
will hold all the Articles so let's
begin coding now my first class I'll
call it collection and every class needs
to import from models. model now within
this class all we need to Define AR
various attributes so I'll explain this
again the class is basically a table and
all your attributes of the particular
class are the columns so the first thing
is the collection name or the genre name
now the collection name would be
something like a fiction or inspiration
or non-fiction could be anything and all
these are strings so when you're
inputting them so in D Jango basically
that's the carefield type so you say
models. carefield and a compulsory
parameter here is you have to insert the
maximum length I'll give it 100
characters next thing we'll have a
description for each jot type that again
would be carfield enter a max length
give it 500 and then we'll also have an
image or a cover for each of the
collection or each of the Jer so that
would be i' say call cover as in
collection cover so this again will be a
carefield type as I'm going to enter the
link for the image over here now the
Links would be pretty large so I'd say a
length of 1,000 so that's our first
class now we'll Define a second class
which is for the particular articles or
the pieces which are inside the
collection so here we'll just go for one
article within a collection and I'll
name this class as piece as in a piece
within a collection again this class 2
imports from models. model and we will
enter the column names now so every
piece will have a title which would be
the name of the piece and that two would
be of carefield type give this a 200 and
then all of these will have a particular
type that is whether it's a book it's a
novel it's a poem or it's a blog post
that is what will go in a type variable
next we'll have the artist name for a
book that would be an author for a poem
that would be a poet so we'll go for the
general term which is artist the year it
was published now the year would be an
integer so we have a different field
type here the inte your field and that
does not require a Max link and finally
again for each piece you'll have a cover
so I'll name that piece cover again
we'll pass the link of an image here so
carefield with the max length of th000
and yeah so our two models are created
here class collection and class piece
now once again we'll do the migration
and what will happen is that the
database will link with this model and
then we can finally View the admin page
and see what exactly that admin page is
that we've been talking about all this
while but before we move on we have
missing out on something so we have a
collection and we have each piece how do
we link the piece with the collection
well this is where the concepts that you
probably learned in database is going to
come into use this is where we'll use a
foreign key so although we are writing a
code here this is exactly how a table in
a database will be created so every item
would have a primary key and now we are
going to use foreign keys in a class
piece to link each piece to a particular
collection so if I say Dan Brown's book
origin so that should be linked through
the foreign key with our collection
fiction so let's create our foreign key
and I'll name it collection but this
time with a small C models. foreign key
so to the foreign key you pass the table
name to which you're making the
reference first which is collection and
and then you pass on an action as to
what will happen to a particular piece
if the collection that it's linked to is
deleted so what we want is if suppose
fiction is deleted then automatically
origin which is tied with fiction should
also be deleted and that is called a
Cascade delete so you say on delete
models. Cascade and now we are finally
done creating our models so now that our
models are created we know these
particular models are created for a
application or a app joural so you go
back to the settings page and here we
had previously inserted this app genre
but back then it was not really required
it was just that there is this other app
that is not included in the default apps
given by Jango so let's put in the name
there but now that we actually have a
database associated with this app we
need to specify this app in its complete
structure that is the configuration so
if you go under joners and then there's
this file apps and under apps you can
see this class Jer config copy this go
back to settings so jer. apps dojer
config so now when you run your server
Jango will check the list of installed
apps and will'll be able to access the
database associated with our newly
created app too but there's more to it
than that remember how previously we
made migrations so we can link our
database with the source code now we got
to make those migrations again cuz now
we created new models so every time you
create a model or you make some changes
to your models you always need to do
your migrations and this time since our
migrations is specific to a particular
app the syntax is slightly different so
you can also use this terminal down here
it works just the same and python
manage.py make migrations and your app
name and here and as you see it says the
models collection and piece have been
created now what this migrations exactly
does is it converts these models that
you have written in coded format into an
SQL form so that's where your tables and
everything stored and now if you check
your migrations folder you'll see
there's a new file under it that is a
current migration that you attempted so
now that the migrations are made you can
finally run your project so once again
an overall migration so I'm back to my
command prompt since the black
background makes it easier to see the
text break out of your server and we
finished our migrations so now we can
run our server no issues and there's no
error with the migrations either let's
now check out our Genna page of course
it'll look the same cuz although we
created our models what the models will
be reflected in is the database the
overall look of the page so far has not
been changed so it's the same so I'll
repeat that one once again every time
you make a change to your model or you
add some new class to your model first
run the migrations for that particular
app that is python manage.py make
migrations and your app name and then
you run a migrations in general so
that's python manage.py migrations and
then you can run your server okay so our
database is created but right now it's
empty so our next step is to populate
our database for that again open a
command prompt and now you need to enter
into the sql's shell so the command for
that is python manage.py shell but
before that I'll just go to the path
where my project is stored and now in
here I'll execute my command so once you
get these three arrows you know that you
have entered the shell and over here you
can execute your SQL commands now before
we input values into our tables what we
need to do is we have to import these
tables cuzz even within this project
there are multiple number of tables
there are some tables which were in
there by default too so from genre.
Models import collection comma piece
which are the name of our tables and
enter so our tables are now imported now
first we'll populate our table
collection okay so collection has three
columns there's the collection name
there's a description and there's a
cover image so go back to your shell so
we'll have an object here collection one
which will be equal to collection so
this would be the Constructor for our
class collection and within this we'll
insert our values so our first attribute
is collection name and that's equal to
fiction our second attribute is the
description and we'll say enter the
world of fantasies for the description
of fiction and finally we have the
attribute called cover which is the
collection cover and in here I'll just
enter the URL of an image I found online
so that's it we have entered the values
for our three attributes now press enter
now let's view if this actually stored
in our database so for that you execute
the command your table name which is
collection
doobs doall and it's empty so what's
wrong we created an object in which we
inserted all the values but then still
our database seems to be empty so this
is because so far this collection object
that we created is only stored in our
Shell's memory we have not actually
committed this to the database so the
command for committing this to the
database would be our object name which
is call one do save and once again we'll
execute the command to check everything
that's present in our database
collection and now you can see finally
that there is an object present and now
we can also check the value of the
various columns in our table collection
for this particular object you can say
call one dot collection name and gives
you the collection name similarly you
can also check its description now as I
mentioned previously every object that
you create in a table has a primary key
associated with it so the primary key
basically holds the uniqueness of that
particular row so we can also check the
primary key for a particular row or an
object just go for call one. PK and it
says the primary key is one now the
primary key is also known as the ID of
the object so you can identify it as ID
2 again you'll get the value which is
one now if you want to change the value
of any of these columns that can also be
done very easily on the shell so suppose
I want to change the description say
call one do description and initially it
was enter the world of fantasies I
wanted to be welcome to the world of
fantasy
so welcome to the world of fantasies and
now if I check the value of call one.
description the value has changed so
that's pretty simple isn't it now if you
think this is simple there's a much much
more simpler way of adding values to the
database which we'll see just in a while
and that is where we'll put in Moree
objects we'll have a few more genners
and we'll also add elements to our table
piece so now we can look into how how to
create our admin page so now that we
learned how to input or populate our
database through the Shell let's go for
the easier and the more efficient way
which is through the admin now before we
do that we need to create an admin and
for that go to your command prompt out
of the shell now in your command prom
type the command python manage.py
create super user okay so once you do
that they'll ask you to create a
username and we'll just go for admin
since we are creating ourself as the
admin enter enter an email ID just go
with admin1 23 at admin.com and a
password so since this is not a
production environment I'm going to just
bypass the password validation but if
your website is going into the real
world then make sure things are secure
enough and our super user is created
successfully so now we can go onto a
browser and here we'll just type admin
so this is our admin page you can see
here there are two tabs groups and users
but the main thing the main reason that
we require the admin page does not seem
to come out here we expected there to be
a database tables present here so we can
directly go and edit them or add some
values to them but it's not there so
what is missing is that we need to go
back to our python page and over here go
down to the admin file so here we we
need to add the models that we want to
appear in the admin page basically we
need to register those models with the
admin page and for that the first thing
we do is we have to import the model so
from dot models import and our two
classes are collection and piece we have
not added anything to our table piece
yet we will later on but anyhow we'll
just register both of them at one shot
and you type in here admin. site.
register collection copy paste this and
change the collection to piece which is
our second table and that's it so with
just these two lines of code you should
have your collection and your piece
tables appearing in the admin page now
when I move back to the admin page and
refresh this you'll see that our tables
have appeared here click on collection
and there's one collection object here
click on that you can see the values of
the attributes and through this admin
page now I'll show you how you can add
more objects so just press on Save and
add another here we can enter our second
collection's name which in my case is
inspiration and description would be be
inspired to do more and for call cover
which is the collection cover I have
another link that I just took from the
net save and we'll add one more so so
we'll have three collections now and our
third collection would be horror the
description let's say the fear is real
although we hope it's not and finally we
have the collection cover paste the link
here save this to so now we have three
objects under collection now as you see
here all our collection objects just say
collection object with a number in
bracket in the similar manner when we
were also going through our shell every
every time we executed the command
collection. objects. all we got just the
name collection object and a number but
we want something more meaningful so
when I look at this table of collections
I know that the first one is the
collection fiction the second one is the
collection inspiration and so on so for
that go back to your code so go under
your models.py file and under the class
collection we'll Define a special method
which is double underscore St Str now
this is an overriding method that is
this method's already defined but the
value return by this method is not of
much meaning to us as of now so now over
here we'll return something that we
actually want to see when we look at the
objects in our table collection and what
I want is I want the collection name to
appear that would be quite clear as to
what object is at which position so I
say collection return on self.
collection name and that should do it
now in the similar manner we can have
the same function for piece two and for
piece what we want to return is the
title so that's it now if I go back to
my admin page refresh this as you can
see we have something much more
meaningful under our table collection
now the objects actually have a name
well the objects don't actually have a
name but we are displaying one of the
attributes of the object and that gives
more clarity as to what object holds so
now we'll start creating our views now
as I mentioned earlier our website would
be such that the first page that the
user goes to is probably going to be the
Jers page which will have the URL Jer
slash and with nothing following it so
the function for that particular URL or
the response for that particular URL we
defined in here in our URLs page under
the journal app which is we'll be
calling the index function in views that
is this function now from that page
there will be certain links and when the
user clicks those links he or she can
move to another web page and that is the
web page where the particular article
present inside our collection would be
displayed so I'll just put down in
comment what pattern of the URL we are
matching for each of these part so the
first one that we are matching is just
Jer followed by nothing now our next
PATH would be Jer followed by a number
now this number one here is actually the
ID of the collection that the user
chooses so if the user chooses the
collection fiction which is our first
collection that has a primary key one so
immediately the user should be sent to
the next web page which is Jor SL one
where one represents the ID of the
collection chosen by the user so now for
path let's pass the expression that will
match this particular URL and that
Expressions actually just an integer
number since the front part that is Jal
slash is already matched and this
integer number we are going to store it
in a variable cuz we'll require that
variable later so you can just say int
colon and collection ID now when you do
this and Jers ID so when you do this
what happens is that this one gets
stored in this variable Jer ID and this
pattern will match this URL now when
this URL is match matched what response
do you want to give that is what do you
want to display on that particular web
page that will be defined in another
function we'll Define under viws we'll
name it details for now of course
details is not defined we'll do that in
a while and give a name to this too
which will be the same details so now we
are able to recognize this URL what we
need to do is next we need to Define
details which will give a response to
that URL so go to your view space page
and you create your details function now
what is displayed in this details
function greatly depends upon the Jer
that is chosen by the user in the first
page which is stored again in jer's ID
so over here you pass not only the
request but also Jer ID and inside
you'll return a HTTP response The
Collection the genre ID is the HTML tags
also need to be within the quotes copy
paste that in here have quotes here too
and now one more thing we need to do is
so jer's ID is an integer but we cannot
concatenate an integer with a string so
we need to convert this to a string and
that's it so let's go back to our web
page and run this page so the first page
which is Jers displays hello world now
if I enter
j/1 which is what we created newly run
the code you see here the genre idid is
one in a similar manner even if I enter
five although we don't have a collection
five it display the genre IDs 5 now
these are dummy web pages so this kind
of a display is fine of course once we
actually start building our view which
we will do very soon things will be more
defined now let's get to actually
creating a good view so what we want
here is uh first of all we do not want
to display any large text so let's
delete that off we need to import our
models because this is where our
database is and of course we need to
fetch information from our database to
be displayed on our view so from do
models import collection and piece now
in our index function what we'll do is
we'll first collect all the objects from
our table collection we'll have a
variable which is all collection and
then to collect all the objects we'll
use the same SQL command that we used so
so that's collection doobs so all your
objects in the collection table will be
stored in all collection now we'll store
this as a dictionary so that we can
iterate over these objects and display
them one by one so we say context equal
to all collection is the key and the
value would be our variable all
collection so that's done now we need to
iterate over this so do we do that
within our views itself but there's no
point of doing that cuz while we
iterating over every object in our
collection table we also need to display
them in a certain format that means that
we need these objects to be somehow
embedded in a HTML file and this is
where we create our very first HTML file
for our first page which is the jer's
page so to create our HTML page inside
Jer create another package and you name
this package templates now inside
templates create another folder and give
this package the name same name as your
app name that is jna and now inside
joner we can create a HTML file I'll
name this file Jer template so all our
template or our HTML files will be in
this path okay so before we actually
develop the Jer template HTML file we'll
go back to our view and complete the
section of so now what we are seeing is
that we have a template we have a HTML
file and that file will Define how we
need to display the objects in our
collection database or our collection
table all we need to do here in our
index function is actually pass these
objects to our HTML file so for this we
have a function render and before we
actually use the function we need to
import the library Jango do shortcuts
and under which we have this function
render this is already imported on top I
did not see that so I'll just remove
that part out and now that you have the
render function you use that to pass
your object so what this render function
does is basically we'll pass context to
it it will type context with the
template name that we pass and it will
return a HTTP response object so you
pass your request you pass the path to
your template that is joural SLT
templates
slj slj template. HTML so now you have
passed your template to and finally the
object which is context so that's pretty
much all you need to do for your very
first view under the views file now we
need to develop our Jers template so for
our HTML file first thing we'll change
the title let's display our app name so
in this particular particular case since
I'm making a dummy website I'm not
giving it a name or anything just going
with our app name okay so now we need to
display our objects which have been
passed from the views folder now the
render function basically passes an
object which is called objector list so
we'll create a for Loop say collection
in object uncore list so this way we can
iterate through all the objects in our
object list
and now see this is an HTML file but
this line of code here this is a python
code so pretty often this will happen
that you need to embed a python code
within your HTML file so what you do is
you insert your python code within curly
brace followed by the percentage sign
this will tell your compiler that hey
although this is a HTML file this line
here is actually a python instruction so
now we able to extract e Jal in fact
I'll name this variable as jna obj now
we need to decide how exactly we want to
display these objects so what I want is
first I want the image of that
particular collection or the Jer to be
displayed which is what I've stored in
one of the variables and then just below
the image I want the name of the joural
to be displayed now this name should be
clickable so that the minute the user
clicks on it we can move on to another
page and then just below the name I want
the description for that journ to be
displayed okay so first we have the
image IMG source and in here I need to
insert the link for that particular
image so the link I actually already
stored in my database as I showed we did
that through the shell and then later on
through the admin page too so how do we
access that particular link well just
like you would in a python code you can
access it through the variable name and
every time you're accessing or you're
displaying just the value of a variable
you insert the variable name within
double braces so double braces and then
journer obj dot call cover and now I'll
give it some height and width to make it
look a little more appealing we'll have
minimal formatting here because the
objective of this tutorial is not to
show you how to write your HTML code but
how Jango works and next I'll have the
name as I said this particular name
would be clickable so inside hriff I
will insert the URL of the page the user
should be taken to once he clicks on the
name so that URL is what we defined here
okay so it's Jor followed by the primary
key or the ID of the category that he
clicked so that would be jna slash and
we stored it in Jer ID so that's the
link the user will be taken to and now
the name that will be displayed and then
after that finally we have the
description to be displayed so that'll
be in a H3 header again double braces
cuz we are going to just print out the
value of a variable and then after each
objects details are displayed we'll
break a line for better formatting what
I'll do is I'll have all of this
embedded within a div and have it align
to the center so that's it we have
created our HTML file here one more
thing I'll just say end for so that's it
our HTML file or our complete display
for the first page has been created so
once again I'll explain what will happen
in the case of our first page only when
the user enters the URL slj followed by
nothing Jango will first check this
url's page the main URL page it'll see
the path has matched here and the action
for this has being defined as you
include the journal. URL page so it goes
to the journal. URL page includes this
and in this there's a function defined
as a response for this particular URL a
very well defined function which is in
our views file so it goes to the Views
file and in the views file we have
completely defined our function index
over here we collect all the objects in
our collection table we convert that
into a dictionary so that it's iterable
then we pass it using the render
function so the render function will
take your template and it will tie that
along with the context which is the
dictionary and it will pass an object a
response object to a HTML file this
response object will be called object.
list and it is iterable so we'll iterate
through the object we will display each
object in a sort of formatted way and
that is it and then the render function
will pass this object all collection to
our template and over here we will
iterate over the all collection which is
the dictionary and using this htl code
here we'll print out the objects in all
collection in a formatted way so that's
it and one more thing make a small
correction back in the views file so
initially I had inserted the entire path
to Jer template. HTML so the thing with
the render function is that it
automatically knows that it must look
into the templates folder so you have to
only give the path after the template
that's
j/j template now let's go back to our
browser and in here put in your
Ur and there you go so that's our first
web page you can see the image for our
joural is here and then you have the
name and then you have the description
okay so that's redirecting us to a page
where there's an error it says that this
path is not found so when you look at
these error guys you will understand
better as to how the matching of the URL
patterns take place first this URL
pattern just this part after your port
number that is checked against the URL
in your main URL file that is D Jango
projects. URL file where we have defined
just joural and then after that it will
check the files that we included in the
J's URL file that is Jer followed by the
the Jer ID now we had defined a dummy
page for this previously and that was
being displayed too so I'll go back to
the code and figure out what the error
is the error is here of because I wrote
Jer ID which does not signify anything
as such now cuz here we have this object
genner obj that is where all the objects
from The Collection table are stored one
by one so what we actually need to
access is the ID for Jer obj now I'll go
back to my browser so now I'm back to my
browser and as you can see here we still
have our front page click on fiction and
yeah we got a dummy page back so now our
next step is to design this page go back
to your code and again designing the
page means we need to start putting
content into our details function now
before we start designing this function
we need to populate the piece table so
again let's go back to our admin page
We'll add the data through the admin
page since that's much easier here you
have piece and click on the add button
first We'll add for fiction the title
we'll give let's insert the book origin
by Dan Brown so the artist would be Dan
Brown and it's a novel and the year is
20 17 that's the year of publication and
for the piece cover I'll just put the
book Origins front page cover I'll just
put in the image here a link save and
add another now for inspiration I'll put
in the poem If and type would be poem
artist is rudor Kipling Kipling with
single P the year of publication would
be
1895 and for the piece cover another
link and finally We'll add one to horor
the title would be the pet
symmetry written by Stephen King and
again this is a novel it's published in
the year
1983 and then link and we save this so
we are done for each of the categories
or each of the genre we have added a
single article so now that our table
piece is also populated we can start
designing the view for this so for our
Details page let's start with removing
this HTTP response here so first what we
need to do is we need to extract the
object that the user selected from our
Jers page so we say
collection
doobs
doget PK equal to genre ID so what we
doing here is as you can see above we
used the query collection doobs doall
which returned all the objects in our
table collection now here we are telling
that okay I want just one object from my
collections table and that particular
object is the one whose primary key
matches that stored in the variable jer.
ID and since jer. ID is defined in this
file and it's basically the ID of the
Jer that the user
selected this
will be a number either 1 two or three
that is one for Fiction two for
inspiration and three for horror so now
that we got that object we will use this
object C item to extract from our piece
table so for that we say piece
doob do filter and to this we pass and
the category that we filter on is the
collection and that is our foreign key
so remember when we created our table
piece we had a foreign key named
collection so we are seeing if
collection is equal to C item then
extract that particular object from our
table piece and then we will return this
again through the render method pass the
request and in here we'll have the path
to an HTML file just like we did in the
previous case but this time have a
different HTML file cuz we want to
display this slightly
differently and then finally we need to
pass the context so we haven't created
the context yet which we will now
although this is just one item every
time you are passing it through the
render function you need to make a
dictionary out of it so just copy paste
this here name this P
item pass in here P
item and and just now I did create a
HTML file in the same path as before
that is under templates you have the Jer
folder and under that I created a HTML
file called detail template nothing's
filled yet but now that we have created
a file we can put in the path here so
just copy paste this and change the Jer
to detail so that's done to now all we
have left is to actually code the HTML
file
so I'll just copy paste
this here and then make the required
correction so in P
item and this would be piece object you
align It Center and piece obj is the
cover we do not really need a hre here
so delete that part out cuz this is the
final page we are not redirecting to any
other page from here of course when
you're building a complete web page this
ideally when you click on the name of an
article the article should
open we wouldn't be including that part
here though cuz it does not bring out
any new functionality of
Jango pce obj and here so P obj do
tile Dash and then we'll print out the
author or the artist name so piece obj
do
artist and finally we can have the
year also what this particular article
is that is the
type so that's pretty much it we'll
change the title
[Music]
too so now that this is done we'll just
end the for Loop
also this is not call cover but now we
got to change it to piece
cover and now we'll go back to our
browser so this is our Jer page refresh
it once again and we'll click on one of
the Jers and yeah as you see the
particular piece related to that genre
gets displayed the pet Symmetry by
Stephen King which is a novel published
in the year 1983 so now we're back to
our code and well our first and our
second page is designed it's working
fine so now we are not going to create
something new instead what is already
created let's modify that now so far the
functions that we wrote work just fine
but Jango provides this thing called
generic classes or generic views what
this does is it makes writing these
functions extremely easy so now you have
four lines of code the exact same thing
can be done in like two or three lines
of code in fact it's not just the easier
method this is also recommended so I'll
tell you how that is done first of all
we need to import the generic package so
from
Jango do views import generic and now
let's delete this entire
thing so our first function is basically
listing up out all the objects in the
table so you have multiple objects all
of them are being listed out now this
kind of a function would belong to a
generic class so far I was defining
functions now I'm speaking about class
so is it a function or a class well it
is a class it's definitely a class but
I'll show you how this class is called
as a function so first we'll finish
writing the class now we have the class
index and this particular Class Type is
a list view because we listing out
objects now under this first we'll have
a template name which is the path to our
template and now to return our query set
so previously we were always returning a
dictionary now we can return a query set
we have a function def query set and
under this we just say return
collection
doobs doall so the same query we were
using previously but now we do not need
to take the objects from the query and
then convert them into a dictionary then
pass it on using the render function we
can simply do this one statement and all
our objects will be sent to a
template where now in the template so
far we were seeing all collection
because that is the key that we were
using in our dictionary but that is no
more we are not using the render
function
anymore when this query set passes an
object it's received by the template
file in a variable named object
list so you replace your previous
variable with object
list and that is it with that we
finished the method for displaying our
first page now we'll move on to the
second page so the second page is
slightly different because this time we
are not listing out multiple objects we
just have one object and we are
basically giving out the details of the
object that means that this
class which we'll still call details is
a detail view class so we say
generic dot detail
view let's delete all of this this first
now the function of this detail view is
basically to display the details of an
object so what we need to do is first we
need to define a model now a model is
collection because we are receiving the
primary key from the collection and each
of this object actually is a part of a
collection the object would not exist if
the related or the counterpart genre of
that object did not exist so a model is
collection and our template name will be
again the path so that's
genre detail
template HTML and that's it so this is
even smaller than our gric view now in
our detailed template initially we had
the name of the key in our dictionary
again this time we don't have a
dictionary pass so what is the value
here well the value here would be
collection Dot piece uncore
set.all so this will return all the
pieces related to that particular
collection and everything is small this
time now we are almost done go back to
your views and you see this is a generic
detail view now the thing about the
detail view class is it always accepts
one parameter go back to your URLs file
as you are passing here a variable gen
uh genore ID of in type you don't need
to do that anymore you can simply say PK
and PK will be passed to this class and
now that's the problem so here we were
calling functions but now we have
classes defined not functions anymore so
we need to figure out a way of calling
this class as a function so for that you
just say
asore view for both of these
classes and that's it as simple as that
now you can call your classes as a
function and since you use the generic
view now things have become so much more
simpler much smaller our code looks very
neat now let's go back to our browser go
to our front page let's see if
everything's displayed right yes it is
so changes worked out just fine click on
one of these tags and as you can see the
page has loaded so much less code very
few lines of code but things work just
as fine as before so web page is all
built but let's add something new over
here to make it look a little more like
a website one of the most common things
that you find in every website you go to
is a navigation bar so let's add the
navigation bar go back to your code now
in here we need a navigation bar in both
our pages so typically what you might
think is the way to go about it is add
the code for navigation bar in your RoR
template and detail template but as you
know whenever you code repeatability is
something that you should be always
against minimum
repeatability so instead what we do is
under Jer the same folder that has all
our templates create another HTML file
and name this base so this will be our
base template and we will add the code
for creating a navigation bar in here
and then we'll just include this base in
our other template plates so first let's
create our navigation bar now we'll be
using bootstrap to create the navigation
bar and every time you work with
bootstrap the first thing you need to do
is in your head section include these
three links so if you have worked with
bootstrap you probably already know you
need to go to the bootstrap website copy
these links paste them here so you're
basically able to access some
stylesheets which are stored in some
other system and once that's done you
can start building your navigation bar
so in your body you have nav
class
Navar and Navar
default so this is the class for
creating your basic navigation
bar but actually we'll go with inverse
instead of default so this has a dark
theme navigation bar it will look better
on our White background website within
this create a div
tag of container fluid so basically what
the container fluid does is
that your navigation bar will occupy the
entire page and it'll fit according to
the page
width now under this you
have the Navar brand
class and the first icon I want
is my home okay so I put in home here
and when I click on home whatever I want
to be redirected to whichever page I
want to be redirected to put the link
for that or the URL for that in
here and I'd like to be redirected to
the jer's page since that's our
homepage now other elements we can
include in our navigation bar we put
them as list elements so class nav
Navar and we want these elements to the
right of our navigation bar so we say
nav bar right now I'm not going into the
details of this since again this is not
a part of the Jango tutorial so we'll
quickly just create the navigation bar
now every element to the right will be
listed out
and I'll have a registration button so
that'll be under
j/ register now I have not created the
view for this URL yet in fact this URL
is not even identifiable yet but for now
I'll just put that in and we'll run it
all
together and finally at the very right
end corner of my navigation bar I want
to display the username that is
whichever user is currently going
through my website now yeah right now we
have not designed the features for all
of this we don't have a registration
form itself so a user does not mean
anything to us right now but very soon
I'll show you how you can create a
registration form you can have users
register to it so then this will start
making sense so we'll say Li class and
in here the way you can extract the
current user of your website is you say
request do
user and that's it that's pretty much
all we need right
now just check all the tags again we
have the nav bar inverse which is the
type the look of our navigation bar
container fluid and here we actually
need to specify that it's a header so we
say in div
class navbar header
well this would be closing right in the
end so I'll just format this
once and finally down here you insert
two python statements you
say block
content uh content is a variable so you
can have have any other name here just
say block content and then end
block so why this I'll explain to you in
a
while so basically this entire part
creates your navigation bar but you
require this navigation bar to be
present in multiple pages so here when
you say block content and N Block it's
basically the content that will fall in
each of the pages so if I go to my Jor
template page I can simply include the
base template here and then everything
inside the jna template page all this
instruction to actually create that page
will come under a Blog so what we'll do
here is we'll go to our template pages
and here we will extend our base. HTML
file so
extends
j/ base do
HTML and then the body the instructions
within the body will be the content of
the block so you say block
content and then end block now we do the
exact same thing with our detail
template so now this way we create Creed
a common base file for a navigation bar
and the content for each of these
templates will be by turn included
within this tag here so we'll have the
navigation par present for every
page now when we move back to our
browser you see the change here there is
a navigation bar if you click on home
we'll be redirected to our Jer page and
then click on one of the
categories and you have been redirected
to the next page the navigation bar is
still present so we also have a user
here currently the only user we created
the super User it's the admin this will
change soon once we start registering
people so next step is to create a form
where we can actually have users
register so for our registration page
the first thing we need to do is we need
to create a
URL and go in here
let's copy this
line so the recognizable URL would just
say register so it would be Jers SL
register and that would call A View
function called user
form and we obviously haven't defined
this class yet so yeah this is also
going to be a class we're going to use
the generic view to create this to it's
going to be pretty simple but since it's
a class we need to call it as a function
so as view will still exist and we here
we'll have user form but before we start
actually creating a view for the
registration page or writing our HTML
file we need to create a blueprint for
the form so why a blueprint for the form
when we did not create a blueprint for
the other Pages I'll tell you why but
first we need to comment this particular
line cuz it will result in error and now
we'll check out our admin
page yeah so this table here is what
we'll be using to store our usernames so
the tables already present here we'll
just tweak it a little that is we'll
take the username we'll take the email
address and we'll take a password field
all of these actually have a password if
you click on them you can see here the
password is hashed so these are the
three fields that we'll collect from the
user so we'll use use the basic form
just selecting exactly what we need so
for that purpose we need to create the
blueprint so to create the blueprint
under Jer create a python file calling
it
forms and now in
here we'll import that table we just saw
that
database so we say Jango do contrib
do do
models import
user two Imports here so and then we'll
import the module
forms okay so now we can create a class
called user
form which will import
from forms. model
form and in here we'll have a class
called meta So Meta basically means the
definition or a description of your
class so inside our class user form
we'll have a description for our class
and in that description we give a model
name so model name is user cuz we'll be
using that particular model I just
showed you and then we'll specify the
fields that we'll be using from this
model because we are not taking all the
fields we're going to ignore a few of
them so we say
fields create a list here and within the
list we'll enter the name of the
attributes that we'll be actually using
for our particular form so we have
username email and we'll take a password
now unlike username and email password
is not just any carefield so over here
we have to specify the password
type so you say forms. carefield and
within brackets you say widget equal to
for s. password input so password input
so from this your Jango will know that
here we basically need to take the
hashed values and not just store what
the user inputs as
characters so that's it with that we
have created the blueprint of our form
next thing is we can actually go to the
Views and begin writing the view the
Class View for our form so the class to
create a form would be called user form
view actually before we proceed we need
to import this so let's do that
first import user
form also need to import some other
packages here we'll import a few
packages for user authorization that's
authenticate
and
login and now we can begin writing our
user form view
class so to use a form view you pass the
object
View and we also need to import a class
for this so let's do
that from
Chango do views.
gener import View
okay so the first thing we need to
define a class for this
form and that would be the user form and
once again a template for this form
which will Define the Outlook this form
has so you give a template name which is
a variable name actually you can have
any variable name here just something
that makes
sense now I don't have a template page
already I've not as in I've not created
another HTML file for the form
specifically but I know that I'll be
creating it the P Jer slash and the name
of the HTML file so that would be form
template now the minute we are done
writing this view I'll show you how we
do the
template that's just basic HTML code so
I'm pretty sure you know how to work
with that too now with forms there are
two things there's the get method that
is basically when the user wants a form
so you give the user an empty form and
there's a post method that is when the
user puts in his or her details into the
form so with our class with our generic
classes these methods are already
defined and within two three lines you
can completely define the functionality
of these so first is the get method to
which we pass self and
request now the first thing is you
provide the form to the user and this
form is empty so you say self. form
class and you pass nothing to this cuz
as I mentioned earlier too the form is
empty and now what you do is you return
this object through the render function
so basically when you do this the form
is combined with the HTML file and an
object is returned
so basically when you do this what
happens is as I mentioned earlier too
the render function works in the same
way it passes the object of the form the
content of the form to the template and
it basically sends out a HTTP
request so that's your template name and
then finally the form
itself and as we did previously this
will be a
dictionary and that is the get function
now we'll move on to the
post again you pass self and
request now when the user enters the
data and then hits the submit button
that's when the post function will be
called all the data will be stored in a
particular data variable and that is
what we'll be defining in the first line
so form equal to self Dot
form
class and
request. poost so all your data will go
into this post
variable now the next thing that the
post function has to do is check if the
data entered by the user does make sense
so for that you say if form do is
valid so if the form is valid save this
data so you say form
Dove so where exactly are we saving this
well as I showed you previously uh Jango
provides this table for user this
database for storing the users and the
group users so that is exactly where
we'll be storing the data received
through this particular
form now if the data is valid we can
separate out the various fields
receive their cleaned
format so first we have our username say
username equal to form dot cleaned
data and that will be
username and then you have the
password so remember when the user
entered the data itself it was stored in
these fields but now we getting a
cleaned version of that data and storing
it in this these variables username and
password and now unlike how we can
usually put the equal to sign and assign
values to certain variables this kind of
a process is not possible for passwords
cuz passwords are not just storing some
carefield data it has a hash value I'll
show you that once again so you see here
you go to the
users admin and if you check this out
the password is not actually stored as
just character it's hashed using some
algorithm and then it's stored so in
this particular case we cannot say that
password is equal to this value there's
a certain function through which you
pass the password such that it's stored
in the required
format so for that you say user do set
password and then you pass password
variable and finally you say user
Dove so guys over here actually we we
are saving the
data in the Shell not in your database
and once our data is cleaned and
everything it is then that we are saving
it into the database so that's why we
have two save statements here so now
that the user has entered their data and
they have hit the submit button we have
saved the data in our database what's
next well now what we want to do is we
need to redirect the user to the index
page basically once the user is done
with the registration process there's no
point of the users staying on the same
page again so we redirect them to the
index page now along with this we'll
also combine login so if the user's
password and username are authenticated
and the user is in active status that
means that the user has logged into our
website so now we'll see how this is
done create a object new user and this
object will hold a user if the username
and the password that we pass here to
this authenticate function is actually
valid and they match that is they form
of that is they form a pair so the
username will be the variable username
and password will be the variable
password so if the new user does exist
that is if new user is not
null if the new user is not none
we'll check the status of the new users
so what is the status again I'll take
you back to that
database gory
users well since we're in the middle of
the code we cannot access this page but
basically this data base or this table
which stores the usernames Has a Field
called status which you probably would
have noticed and next to the active user
there's a green tick so if the user has
that green tick if the user is active
that means his session is in progress so
it's basically like logging
in so you say if new user do is
active you log in the user so you send
request and the new user
object and once the user has logged in
you return the user to the index page
and this is where you need to use a
function redirect before we use that
function we need to of course import
it so here uh redirect is within this
same shortcuts
Library we'll just add and redirect
here so index page is basically called
joural so that's where the user will be
taken now if this user is not
authenticated that is there is some
invalid data entered we basically give
the user back a form an empty form give
them another chance to fill it so for
that we just copy paste this line here
the
render put that down
there and that's it with that we are
done creating our view for our user form
now what we are left with is actually
creating this HTML file so let's do that
again go to joura your domain folder and
create a HTML file now remember what we
named a HTML file in this view that's
form template make sure the same
name so let's start creating the form
the first thing we do is for the form to
we want to add the navigation bar so go
to your go to any of your HTML files and
copy out these lines here
registration then you have the blog
content which is exactly where you'll be
putting all your
content that goes here and then we'll
start and then we'll add the end
block again copy paste that too okay so
now we can start typing out our HTML
code so first is our form tag
now this is going to be a extremely
simple straightforward
form and now the thing with d Jango is
whenever you're having a form an
interactive form make sure to include
this csrf token here so csrf stands for
cross site request
forgery that can be sent actually from
and it's a type of cross site scripting
attack that can be sent from Malicia
site through your visitor's browser to
your own server so to prevent this D
Jango provides a very simple technique
which is where you provide this csrf
token now make sure you're always
providing this whenever you have a post
method and you're not redirecting or
you're not using the URL of or you're
not using an external URL cuz that means
that your current page csrf token is
being sent to an external web page and
obviously that kind of a leage would h
for the security okay so we'll be taking
a
username again email is also type
text and finally the
password and after all the fields you
have finally the submit button
and that's
it so our HTML page is also ready
now so now you need to move on to the
url's page and uncommon this cuz now we
actually have a
response also this called user form view
now I'll just stop the server and run it
again although this is not really
necessary if you just go back to your
page refresh it everything works
fine okay now we will move on to our web
page okay so our homepage is working
fine just like before next you click on
register and here's your form so as you
can see here the navigation bar is
present for the form tool now we'll
create a new user name simply with the
email ID simply
23@gmail.com
and
password that's it now click the submit
button and the minute we click the
submit Button as you can see you gotone
transferred back to the homepage and in
here if you see the right hand corner
you'll notice that we had admin before
but now it's simply so that is because
we just now created a user simply and
the minute you create a user by default
that becomes the active user now to
check this we will move on to the admin
page and this is our landing page so now
what happened is that since the other
user that we newly created is the active
user that means we got logged out of the
admin's profile and to view the admin
page of course we need to be logged in
as the admin so I log back in and as you
can see here under the users group
you'll notice we have a new user created
simply with the following email ID so
that's it guys hello everyone welcome to
this video tutorial on SQL basics for
beginners by simply Lear in this session
we will learn about the database and the
need for a database then we will
transition to SQL and see some basic SQL
queries after knowing what AOL query is
we will see the features and
applications of esol query and then we
will have a hand on some of the basic
SQL queries so hey everyone I'm abisara
from Simply learn and welcome to this
video one esql basics for beginners but
before we begin if you love watching
Tech videos subscribe to our Channel and
hit the Bell icon to never miss an
update let's start with database a
database is a vast collection of data
that is stored and retrieved
electronically from a system in today's
world data has become the new oid which
has mandate companies and businesses to
rely on an excellent database to store
their vast amounts of
data every millisecond the tech Giants
are accumulating V amounts of data that
need to be stored the database comes
with features to update and effortlessly
manipulate data and not only that these
database provider companies ensure the
data to be safe and secure they also
provide tools to extract useful
information to help the companies make
meaningful decisions after knowing about
the database let's see how SQL
communicates with the database to get
desired
results SQL stands for structured query
language the structured query language
is the standard language used by
database operators and developers to
carry out different operations from
manipulating updating and retrieving
data from relational databases now let
us see how we write a basic query
there's a customer table with columns
customer ID customer name age gender
date of purchase address item and price
and we need to extract the customer ID
and customer name from this
table so we will write a query select
customer ID comma customer name from
customers semicolon when we will execute
the query in my SQL workbench we will
get the desired result that is the
output table with customer ID and
customer name this is how we write a
query to extract the information from
the database we'll see some more queries
as the session
proceeds now we'll see what the features
of SQL are SQL lets to access any
information stored in a relational
database with SQL queries data is
extracted from the database in a very
efficient way the structured query
language is compatible with all database
systems from Oracle IBM to Microsoft and
it doesn't require much coding to manage
databases now we will see applications
of SQL SQL is used to create a database
Define its structure implement it and
lets you perform many functions SQL is
also used for maintaining an already
existing database SQL is a powerful
language for entering data modifying
data and extracting data in a database
SQL is extensively used as a client
server language to connect the front end
with the back end th supporting the
client server architecture SQL when
deployed as data control language DCL
helps protect your database from
unauthorized access after knowing SQL
with its features and applications let's
go through some basic queries in
SQL that is ddl data definition language
DML data manipulation language DCL data
control language TCL transaction control
language ddl or data definition language
consists of the SQL commands that can be
used to define the database schema let's
see ddl commands create command is used
to create the database or its objects
like table index function views store
procedure and triggers drop is used to
delete objects from the database
truncate is used to remove all records
from a table alter is used to alter the
structure of the
database DML or data manipulation
language consists of the SQL commands
that deals with the manipulation of data
present in the database insert into
command is used to insert data into a
table update is used to update existing
data within a table delete is used to
delete records from a database table
select this command helps you to select
the attribute based on the condition
described by the we
close TCL transaction control language
these commands deals with a transaction
within the database commit commands
commit a transaction roll back command
roll backs a transaction in case of any
error occurs save point it sets a save
point within a trans action set
transaction it specify characteristics
for the
transaction DCL or data control language
it consists of the commands such as
Grant and remoke which mainly deals with
the rights permissions and other
controls of the database system Grant
command gives user access privileges to
database revoke it with draw user access
privileges given by using the grant
command now we will have hands on some
basic queries in my SQL workbench if
getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scaleup by simply learn click
on the link in the description to know
more now we'll see some basic queries
executing in my SQL workbench so we'll
start and first query we will run will
be use sys that is the
database this command is used to select
the database in which we want to create
or manipulate any data now we'll see
another command that would create a
table now we will add attributes to the
customer table that that would be the
columns first would be the customer ID
and we
will act at it as a primary
key the next St we would add be customer
name customer underscore
name and it data type would be Vare
next attribute we would add would be
AG with in data
type next attribute would be
chendo with correct data
type next we will add as date of
purchase
with date data
type now we'll add another attribute
that would be
address with data type
Vare next we will write the attribute
item that will be item purchased with
data type
Weare next would be the
price okay for price we will make it as
float
and let's shift this to next line and
now we'll execute this
command yeah you can see that the table
is
created now we have to insert values
into
it for that we'll write a command
insert
into customers
values and I have all the records
written in the
notepad so I will copy
these and paste it
here these are 20 records like all the
attributes they are in the order so we
have written all the records in the
order only like customer ID that would
be 101 customer name that would be
yourself age that would be 22 gender
maale date of purchase this is the date
of purchase address pun item that is
vegetable purchased price that is 80 so
now we will run this command and all
these records they would be inserted
into the
table and these are 20 commands 20
records
you can see insert into Cal
values the command has been executed and
they have been inserted into the table
now we'll see the table for that we'll
write the command select star
from customers
here you can see the table in the output
grade okay I will make sure you will see
the whole
table with all the 20
records yeah you can see all the 20
reports they have been inserted
now you see another
command and for that we would just get
the output as customer ID and customer
name in the output grade for that we'll
write the command
select customer ID
comma customer name
from customers
semicolon and we'll run this
command and we will get both the columns
customer ID and customer name in our
output
grid now we'll see another command that
would be drop the drop command just
removes the component from the
database so we'll write
drop table
and table name that would be
customers and semicolon and we will
execute this
command now the table has been removed
from the database to verify whether the
table has been removed from the database
or not we will run a command select star
from customers semicolon and execute
this command
and what we will get is Select start
from customers error code table say
customers doesn't exist the table has
been removed from the database so the
drop command worked
here now we don't have any table that is
the customer table has been dropped from
the database so we have to create that
table
again so we'll go at the
top
okay yeah and we'll create the table
again
and we'll insert all the records again
into the
table both the commands have
run now we will run this command to see
whether the table has been created and
the records have been inserted into the
table or
not both commands have
worked now we'll see another
command that would be TR kit
the trunet command just manages all the
records from the
table trunet
table table
name
semicolon and just run this
command the command has been
executed now we'll see
yeah you can see that all the records
from the table has been vanished so the
trunet command worked here now to carry
other operations we have to insert all
the records again into the
table we'll do that we'll again go
upwards and run this command insert into
customers values and all the
records and we'll execute this command
and the command has been executed and
all the records are again in the table
we'll run this command and check
it yeah you can see all the records they
inserted into the
table now we see another command that
would be
alter alter command is used to update
any record into the table you'll see
alter
table table name that is
customers and now what we should do uh
okay we'll drop the column AG from the
table so we'll write command
drop
column age
semicolon I'll run this
command the command has been executed
and now we'll check whether the age
column has been dropped or not select
star from
customers semi column and we will
execute this
command yeah you can see the age column
has been dropped off the table so the
alter command has been executed
successfully okay so now we'll see
another thing uh like if you want to
comment something during the execution
you can do
that just write two minus signs and the
text this would be the
comment and you can also
use
slash star and that
text inside it and star and slash so
this is also the comment section you can
write comment with this syntax or with
this syntax they both work now we'll see
another command that would be update
this is also used to manipulate data in
the table to update any record into the
table so we will write update table name
that would be
customers and what we should update okay
we will update a record uh we will
change the customer name and address
and we have the primary key as customer
ID so we will use that so update
customers
set customer
name equal
to
James
comma and
addressal to uh B
where customer
ID equal to
101 okay you can see here in the table
101 customer ID the customer name is
Joseph and the address is pun we have
updated command and we will execute it
see okay okay we have an error
here uh yeah
no it's correct we will execute this
command yeah the command has been
executed successfully and now we'll
check the table with the command select
star from customers
semicolon you can see the row has been
updated the customer name is James here
and the address is Boston so the command
has been executed
successfully now we'll see another
command that would be
delete so delete command is used to
delete any particular record for any
particular row so we'll write the
command
delete
from
customers
where customer
ID equal to
102
semicolon so the second row that is with
customer ID 102 that would be deleted
when we'll execute this
command now we'll check into the
table Yeah you can
see the cord has been
deleted now we'll see distinct command
that is used to return different values
so we will write command
select
distinct and the column name for which
we want different values to be in the
output grid we select
address
from
customers and we will execute this
command
yeah these are the address or these are
the cities in the address which are
different and which are unique and we
have get that through the distinct
command now we will see minimum command
minimum command is used to get the
records or get the data that is minimum
of all the data so for that we will
write the
syntax
select
minimum like m in bracket we will write
the attribute name or the column
name for which we want the data to be
minimum
as less price this would be the
attribute
name from
customers so we will execute this
command and what we would see is that 60
would be the less price
like the customer table they have the
column price and in that we all we have
all the prices and from that the minimum
price is 60 and we have get it at less
price similarly we have the maximum
command to get the maximum amount from
the column we will use the maximum
command select Max in bracket we would
write the attribute name
as Max
price from
customers and we will execute this
command and what we get is 3400 it's the
maximum price from the price column now
we'll see another command that would be
count count command it Returns the
number of rows according to the query so
we'll run the query and see like how it
work
works we'll write
select
count and the attribute name that would
be uh customer
ID customer
ID from
customers
semicolon and when we'll run this
command we will get 19 as a result that
is it counted the number of customer it
is that is 19 in the
table now we'll see another
command that would be average so it just
gets the average of the numbers and how
we do it let the
C
select AVG and the attribute name for
which we want the
average from table name
semicolon and we'll execute this command
and we'll get the average of the price
from the customer
table now if you want to add up all the
prices from the customer table you can
use the command sum so how we will
execute that command select sum in
bracket we will write the attribute name
that would be
price
from customers
semicolon and we'll run this command and
we'll get the sum of the prizes from the
customer
table now we'll see we command we
command is used to filter records uh
let's see it through
syntax so we will write
select
star from
customers where
here
address uh yeah we
will where address equal
to
Pune
semicolon and then we'll run this
command and yeah this is the table where
we have get the records with address as
sping so this is the functioning of we
command now we'll see Group by command
that is used to just group the number of
rows that have the same values we will
see it through the
syntax like we will write
select
count attribute name that would be
customer
ID
comma address
from table
name and group by accordingly with
address uh here the comma will not come
yeah this is the command select count
customer ID comma address from customers
Group by
address then we'll execute this command
you will get this table that would be
these are the different addresses and
these are the number of times yeah
number of persons who live in this
address with the account with respect to
customer
IDs now we'll see having close with the
help of an example
only
select count attribute name that will be
customer ID
comma
address from table name that will be
customers Group
by
address
having
account customer
ID greater
than 3 3
three semicolon and then we will execute
this
command and you can
see the output we have got through this
command that is Group by
command was this and when we have added
having Clos having count customer ID
greater than
three we just go the customer ID count
with
four now we'll see another
command that is order
by select star from table name that is
customers and we will order this output
by
address semicolon
we have got the output with respect to
the
address the address has been
assigned alphabetically here so what
exactly is mongod
DB it is a document oriented nosql
database it was initially released in
August 27th
2009 mongod DB replaces the concept of
row of conventional relation data models
with something called documents it
offers developers the flexibility to
work with evolving data models since
it's document based mongodb allows
embedded documents arrays and represents
complex hierarchical relationships using
a single record it is also schema free
which means that the keys defined in the
document are not fixed as a result
massive data migrations can be ruled out
but you must be wondering when there's
something like SQL why is no SQL or
mongodb used there are a few reasons why
mongodb is widely used first up is
flexibility mongodb's notion of
documents that can contain subdocuments
nested in complex hierarchies is really
expressive and flexible flexible query
model a user can selectively index some
part of a document or a query based on
attribute values regular expressions or
ranges next up is native agregation
native aggregation allows its users to
extract and transform data from mongodb
and either load them in a new format or
export it from mongodb to other data
sources it makes it extremely
compatible lastly as mentioned earlier
the schema free model now applications
get the power and responsibility to
interpret different properties in
different ways now that you know what
mongodb is and why exactly it's used
let's have a look at the characteristics
of
mongodb firstly it's a general purpose
database now mongodb can serve
heterogeneous loads and multiple
purposes within an
application again it has a flexible
schema design document oriented
approaches with non-defined attributes
that can be modified on the Fly is a key
contrast between mongodb and any other
relational
database next up is scalability and load
balancing it's built to scale both
vertically but most important ly
horizontally using sharding an architect
can share load between different
instances and Achieve both read and
right scalability when it comes to load
balancing this happens automatically and
transparently to the user by The Shard
balancer again we have aggregation
framework now mongodb offers an extract
transform and load framework that
eliminates the need for complex data
pipelines native replication now data
will get replicated across a replica set
without complicated
setup security features both
authentication and authorization are
taken into account in
mongodb next up is Jason now Json is
widely used across the web for front end
and API communication and as such it's
easier when the database is also
compatible with the same
protocol lastly we have map reduce now
again map reduce is an excellent tool to
build data pipelines and mongod DB uses
map redu readily now let's quickly have
a look at the working of mongod TV data
is stored in documents with the help of
key value pairs now the data is stored
in the Bon format at the back end
mongodb converts Json data into a binary
format known as Bon mongodb also makes
provision for nested data now all of
these documents are stored in a
collection
these collections hold multiple
documents and since mongodb is schema
less the documents in one collection
need not be similar now again these
collections are stored in the entire
mongodb database as mentioned earlier
mongodb makes provision for nested data
this makes fetching of data extremely
efficient when compared to other
databases now you must be wondering
where exactly mongod DB can be applied
or used so let me help you with that
several areas of Technologies use
mongodb as their dbms currently some of
them are Internet of Things mobile
applications realtime analysis
personalization catalog management and
content management now all said and done
let's look at some of the companies that
use mongodb
currently companies like Toyota sap
astroica Adobe Verizon Cisco Barclays
and Google among others readily deploy
mongodb as their database management
system in this video I'm going to help
you install and set up mongod DB on your
Windows system you will have to navigate
to the official mongodb
website and here you can
see software so go ahead and click on
community server under
software and you can see that the
current version is
4.4.4 and the platform is Windows and
make sure that the package is MSI all
right now go ahead and press
download so this could take a
while all right so once it's
downloaded go ahead and install
it now since it's already installed on
my system uh the installation process
will be different but you just need to
follow the steps there and uh finally
install it so once you're done with the
installation you can uh go to your C
drive and here you can click on program
files and you can see that mongod DB is
installed and inside of it you have the
server folder and then you have the 4.4
folder and then you have the Benin
folder right so here you have the
application that is your and the
 applications both are executable
files now the mongod D file or the
application is the Damon process now
this is the background process that
makes sure you retrieve the data from
the database access the data so it does
all the background tasks so after the
installation now you need to create a
path to this file by doing this you
don't have to always go to the bin
folder and then execute the file you can
directly execute the file on your
command prompt right so for that let's
just go to our environment
variables but before that let's just
uh copy this path right and here under
the user variable section click on path
and say edit and go ahead and just paste
it right I've already pasted mine so
just go ahead and paste it and click on
okay
and say okay right so now you've created
the path successfully now let's head to
our Command Prompt and run the
file
so here you can just directly type
since the path has already been created
so just go ahead and say
 and here you can see that your
 server has been generated and uh
with this you know that your in mongod
DB has been successfully installed and
your server is up and running right so
just for confirmation let's see if there
are any databases and how much space
they've occupied so you can right now
just type show
DBS and when you click on it it says
admin config and Local Host and all of
it is zero so with that you have
successfully installed mongodb on your
system and it's up and running all right
in this particular tutorial we will be
learning what mongodb is all about and
their advantages and some practical
demonstrations so let's get started
now so here in mongodb we would like to
discuss about what is the mongod DB so
as we know the mongod DB is known to be
called a
traditional document based database okay
which stores the data in a document okay
no SQL means it doesn't says like no to
SQL instead it says not the SQL that
means it is not only SQL but it is
supporting the other approaches too okay
so the document based when you talk
about it actually represents the typical
heral relationship using the single
records that means how the records are
related with each other so that's how
exactly it represents and it is a pure
schema free environment so that you
really do not need to have a schema
before you go and develop this program
so it is a pure schema less envirment
due to that it is giving you far more
better flexibility when you talk about
completely unorganized
involvement so what is nosql so the
here's the idea about a nosql so it is
completely into the non-relational
database like traditionally if you see
any non-relational database uh you talk
about uh typical no SQL uh it's purely
into the document base here no SQL does
not use any tables like in rows and
columns a traditional rdb approach if
you see there they are using a complete
table structure like they talk about
columns they talk about rows and are all
about so here in nosql it stores a
relationship data in the documents so
the different type of nosql databases
are available like you talk about called
document based you talk about key value
based you talk about white column based
and graph based different options are
available for the no SQL but the one
which we are using at mongodb it is a
purely document base database now here
we would like to go ahead with some
demonstrations like talking about like
how mongodb installation works and the
other
aspects okay everyone so now we're going
to start working on the first option
called mongodb
installation okay see mongodb
installation is very simple if you open
a website and go for this website name
called mongod DV
download if we talk about mongodb
download you're going to see the
official website called mongodb
Community download is
available when you click here so you can
see it is taking the current version to
4.4.6 Macos it by default detected my
platform however you can select depends
on which platform you have it and after
that you will be clicking on this
download okay so it'll get ready for if
you are from
Windows I would say in this Windows you
can select appropriate option like two
options are available you can talk about
MSI or talk about zip my recommendation
is you can stick to the zip power
portion because it won't start any
mongodb Services behind the scene that
is really helpful because you really do
not want mongod DV to to be there
running unnecessary even if it is not
required my suggestion is to stick to
the zip file so here once the mongodb is
there so you will be seeing there are
two files available inside the mongodb
folder inside the bin so once you
download the zip you will find two
different type of files are available
let me mention those
so inside the bin folder you will see
two files one is called
mongod okay the another file which is
available called
 mongod is to basically start the
mongod D server and the mongod is
actually the client which will connect
with the
mongod clear so if you are
in Windows environment so once you are
inside this B folder of your zip file
you will get the mongod so you have to
double click on this it'll start a new
command prompt so you do not need to do
anything further just minimize this
command prompt and go inside the bin
folder again and click on the another
binary file called so it will get
start as a client okay since I'm using
the MacBook here the concept is little
different about how mongodb can be used
used okay so this is just a basic way of
how the moo is being used into your
code okay everyone so now as we are in
the Macbook so here to start mongod we
have a very special way to start with so
here I'll start with my terminal and
here I would like to paste one very
simple command to start my mongod DV
database that is called mongod D and
after that you have to say hyph iph DB
path it is the place where your database
will be starting and one more important
thing I forgot to mention like mongod
would not start automatically inside
your Windows machine unless inside your
C drive you have to create a new folder
name called data and under this you have
to create a new folder name called DB
because automatically when the mongod
starts it looks inside the C drive data
inside a DB folder there your all record
will get stored so do not forget
whenever you're trying to use the mongod
D so you must make have you must have
this particular folder structure in
place in your local machine otherwise
this is not going to start every time
you start your mongod without this
location it automatically terminates So
to avoid those make sure that you have
this data DP folder ready with you
however you can also change the location
of this particular folder structure for
which we will discuss it a little later
on but as of now we can see I'm giving
my location that is called hyphen DB
pass/ dat DB I hit enter you can see now
my DB is starting now and since
it's stuck so I have to start the new
terminal now so here I open the another
Tab and type
 and the moment I type now
you can see it it is now connected with
my mongodb and now it is ready that's
the first thing you need to
remember okay now to
check which other databases are
available to you so you can just type
show
DBS so it will show you the number of
databases which are already there inside
your
existing newly installed mongod
DP but you can go back and create new
database 2 here you can see some
databases are already present however
you go back and create the new databases
into your system and to create this
database we have very simple option
available here name call
use simply DB if I say use simply DB it
automatically creates this database and
take you inside let's see now you can
see
you say use simply TV it automatically
creates though it is not there but
automatically takes you in while
creating
those okay so that means you are in
current database name called simply TB
so if you're not sure which database you
are in so you can just type DBS or
DB and it will show you that your
current database is simply
DB that's it so your database is set and
we are all good to go ahead with our
next level development
hello everybody and welcome back in a
previous videos you have seen like how
to create a database and how to identify
whether my database is there or not so
if you remember previously we have
created our database using use keyword
so if I just see my databases which we
have created last time so how we can
check this out we can say
show space
DBS okay so you can see we have a got
database list but we do not have any
database which we have created class
time is registered here that's quite
surprising because when we have created
our database it should be listed here
but it is not let's do one more time I'm
saying
use uh s
DB and uh I'm saying switch to
SLB now when I say once again show
DBS so I still don't see my databases
listed here there is a reason the reason
is according to the mongodb rule unless
we have minimum one record or collection
is stored inside my mongodb it really
can't show in the list now I want to
tell you about a few important
things now here when we talk about
called mongodb in this mongod DB
compared to the relational data base
here the table which is actually an
rdbms it is called here it is
called
collection
okay DB is still called DB here okay
that means the database will be still
called database but row what you use
this word in a traditional rdbms here it
is known as called
document if you remember I told you like
it is a document based database so here
every single record what you try to
insert it is not
called a typical row it is instead
called a document so every table is
called collection and every single row
it is
called document that's what exactly the
difference
is okay now here once it is ready we
will go ahead and talk about our next
feature now
well we have to basically go and create
a new collection okay so what we can say
DB
dot
create collection and here I can pass my
collection name I can say
demo collection so once it is done I can
see it is collection is created in
typical language I can say the table is
created and now when I try to see same
show
DBS I can see my database is now
listed okay that's how exactly it works
so the very simplest way of how we use
in my
code well in our previous examples we
have seen like how we can create a
collection and uh we can give the name
and I can see the details are listed
when I say show DBS but there's again
another alternative option available
where you can just do that without even
saying db. create
collection well if I want to create a
collection I really don't need this
particular functionality called create
collection I can directly use this
statement name called uh DB
do DB DOL
student do insert and here we would like
to add the property like a name and here
we can
say
admin now what is that meaning is when
you say db. student.
insert and I hit enter you can see this
uninserted one and surprisingly when you
try to
say press enter you will will see this
SL student is not a collection which we
have created earlier so what this line
does this line not only create the
collection for you but also add a record
inside with this property called name
because it is a mongodb and mongodb is
always following the Json based
structure and due to that it goes with
the key and value
pairs so DB is a predefined keyword SL
student is a collection name insert is a
Comm through which you are trying to
insert the record now to check how many
collections are
there okay so we have one property
called
show show collections when I say show
collections I can list down those number
of collections or else I can say tables
in a typical rdus language which are
there added in my system so SL student
in which I can see the record is
inserted so if I want to confirm I can
simply say DB do
SL student. find find is a function
through which I can list down those
number of Records which are added I say
fine and you can see that the records
are received at the same time when I say
DB dot the name call Demo collection
okay db. democ collection.
find I'll find no record reason because
this collection was created but there
was no record which was inserted in but
you will see when I write this command
called SL student. insert it not only
create a new collection for me but also
insert the record into my table also
called a collection
that's where exactly it is giving you
the advantage when you want the
collections to be created along with the
data this is the way how you can really
do
this clear
but whenever you talk about db. create
collection many people always think
about what is the significance of having
this db. create collection look db.
create collection is having its own
significance we never recommend this
technique
okay to create a collection because when
you create a collection you always bring
some restrictions some terminology which
missed out whenever you talk about this
line so having this db. create
collection you can also offer some
additional capping which is not possible
when you use
db. collection name do insert so you
might be thinking what those cappings
you're talking about let me try to brief
you when I say DB
dot
create collection and here we are
providing the first name called suppose
student okay when I say student so after
this is student additional parameters
what we can pass is this when I
say C colon true
what we saying cap col true so you are
enabling the capping after that the next
parameter I'm going to pass that is
known as called
size in this size we are providing the
size suppose I'm saying 5
2 4 and also we are seeing
280 that is the size of 5 MB and here we
giving call Max colon 5 what exactly
that meaning is see the meaning is very
simple whenever we try to bring this
create collection option so capping true
means you are enabling the capping so
what ises that meaning is it is trying
to say in this particular collection
name called student maximum number of
documents can be either five or less
than five clear and the collective size
of documents cannot be increased to more
than 5 MB that means you're trying to
say either by adding the the total
number of five records the collective
size of five document will reach to 5 MB
okay or else the maximum number of five
documents can be stored so whichever
fills earlier you may have a total
number of four documents which are
pretty heavy and
they reach to the size 5 MB and beyond
that the next document won't be added or
else you can have the five documents
which has not yet even reached so any
option will help you to achieve this so
that's where exactly you can offer the
capping but this is only possible when
the user is trying to say db. create
collection this option is not possible
when you're trying to use this so that's
the benefit of having this db. create
collection and this is what we always
recommend well now we would like to talk
about our next feature here inside the
same mongod DB so we now know how to
create a collection how to create a
database and how to switch from one
database to the another database now we
will tell you like how to insert a
document so far we have already seen how
to insert a document inside the moo TV
now we would like to also show you how
we can insert the documents using
multiple
techniques so remember one
thing mot TV comes with two different
type of
documents one is called relational
document and second is called embedded
document mostly while working with
mongodb we always recommend you to use
embedded documents because that helps
you to scale up your application without
any hurdle okay the embedded documents
means what that means
the uh I would say the parent record as
well as the child records both stores in
the same
location fine so how exactly that is
let's take a look about this example
here we would like to insert some
records by saying DB
do student I do not have a student
collection but I'm just telling you db.
student
do insert here we would like to add some
records what I'm trying to say the
registration
number registration number I'm just
saying uh 1 2 3 4 you can get anything
now the next one we'll talk about called
name this name we can
say student one followed by the next one
I'm talking about which course the
student has registered so we can
say course inside this course we would
like to say the course name so let's
say course name we are giving the course
name called and
MCA okay followed by another property
called
duration okay I'm giving this duration
is called 3 years like
that after that this curly Braes is
closing that means see the idea is like
you see the course is an embedded
document because from course you have
got few more properties like in course
name and duration
I'm closing this and starting the
another property and that is called
address okay sorry let me remove from
here and from address and address we can
say one more cly bis and inside this
address we can say
City I'm giving the name called
what Bang
the another one we are using that is
called
State let me remove this
state
colon
K okay and the third property we're
using that is known as called
country here is saying I that is called
India so it is closing
here okay and it is closing here here so
the inner document and outer document
both are closed hit enter and now you
can see the records are inserted one
thing you might notice the
course and the address these two are
embedded documents and they do not have
any primary key of its own instead the
course and address both are directly
dependent
on the student
object or the student database so
I will say student have the registration
number
fine and the primary key so the primary
key will be associated with the most
outer document and the inner documents
are directly associated associated with
them and now when I try to say DB
do
student.
find you can see now the records are
fetched I can understand many of you are
thinking every time while adding the
record we do not add any object ID and
here you might have observed and there
also you have op then what exactly that
ID is now let me brief you this ID is
nothing but a unique primary key your
mongodb has offered you that means
mongodb says whichever data you're
inserting it so by default with every
single document mongodb will associate
this by default property called UND ID
which you can't even
ignore however you can override I
haven't provided any underscore ID as a
property because this is a predefined
property associated with every single
mongodb document if you want to override
it you can override from this value to
any value because if you do not pass any
value this value will be automatically
provided that is a typical hexadecimal
value however if you want want to
override it you can override the value
of underscore ID but you can't change
the key name let's try with some another
record so the same record if I try to
add let's
go I'm using
call student 2 and here I'm saying 1 2 3
4 5 here if I want to override it I can
just say
underscore ID colon now I can give the
value called what
101 this you need to remember so I'm
overriding this value with 101 now
adding it now records are added now let
me call find now you see this time the
records when I fetched so in this record
the first record contains a default
uncore ID in the second record it is the
one which I have
provided and remember one thing in Bongo
DB you really can't offer any property
other than underscore ID as a primary
key
here there's no concept of having the
con like in composite key which you used
to do in traditional idbs here you have
only underscore ID and this is the only
property which you can override it else
by default the new value will be given
to you so this is the first way of how
the insert document has been done we'll
be telling you the another ways where
the other documents are also added okay
so in the previous examples you have
seen like how we can add the records but
I also tell you there's another
alternative options are available if you
want to insert the records in a bulk
that option is also possible in TV
how we can do let's try to understand
here here we would like to use one very
simple concept called
V
my EMP equal to now I'm starting with
uh typical object like this and after
that I'm adding this and uh within this
I'm adding the first property called EMP
ID colon one after this okay now you can
see it is not understanding because that
is a challenge when we talk about called
uh you know the logical part because you
go with multiple lines it is not
supporting however we have to follow the
same lines now EMP ID 1 and we just give
the second property called EMP
name so EMP ID uh
just remove this I just say EMP ID and I
say
EMP Name
colon
admin okay adding it here so
first record here again I'm adding
another one that is
called EMP ID colon
2 okay and
now
colon
manager okay
again column
3 and
col
QA add
it okay and this curly bres is closing
after this your square bracket is also
closing and once it is done you come
down and say
DB
dot new
EMP do insert
okay and here you pass the name of the
object called my
am and you can see now it is telling you
and inserted three that is known as
called bulk insert where you're
inserting multiple records in a single
shot see how easy it is for
you okay now you simply use DB dot The
Collection name is what your
new do
find and you can see now all three
records are inserted with its default
object
ID okay so that's is a really nice idea
to have the ID to be
provided okay remember this is statement
so you understood finally how we can add
the records in a bulk going forward we
will also talk about which is related to
your update as well as delete in your
upcoming demos okay but here that is the
first thing which you realize it how we
can perform those kind of operations in
very very simple and straightforward
manner okay everyone so now we have got
three records with us and in case if I'm
planning to perform update on any of my
records how will I do this now so we
have a predefined functions varable name
called update function let's see how
this update function can really work so
we use this statement name called DB dot
what is my collection name which is
known as called a new EMP new
EMP okay
dot
update okay so what I will do I will say
tb. new EMP do update
here okay now when we talk about called
update we have a
statement
available okay what is that that is
called EMP ID we call EMP name so we say
wherever the EMP ID is this I want to
change what the name how can I do this
now very simple
uh to perform this what I would like to
do now I want to basically add few more
records to give you some more better
idea
uh you can see now here we have a call
admin ID name so I just do one thing I
just change the
IDS uh 1 2 3 I just say
four I
say5
I6 okay and I call this again the three
records are inserted now let me try to
call find now we have total number of
six records are available where admin is
repeated manager is repeated QA is
repeated now let me try to update the
record okay now I want to say DB dot new
EMP Dot
update here I would like to perform the
property like in
what uh name I EMP
name EMP Name colon I say
admin okay so I just close that and I
use another curly braces with dollar set
set means you want to set the new value
here we are
giving EMP
name okay what I want to do I say whever
the name is admin change to
what admin new that name I want to
change it close this close
this and run now you can see it is
saying n match
one and the record fields are updated
like this let me me
check well here I will see uh the value
called admin new is updated but I have
one more admin called admin it is not
changed and that is something which you
need to notice what you need to notice
is notice is like when you try to
perform update so what mongodb does it
starts from the top find the first
record change the value or modify the
value and come out from the loop it
doesn't carry forward
it search process for the next level of
results and that is something which is I
really want to do that so in case if
you're planning to change those values
multiple times so what you need to do
let's take a look here in the similar
example here we have a called name admin
second property we have a called manager
let's try to
say managers are repeated twice we just
want to change to
new
underscore manager and I want to update
multiple values so what I will do here I
will put comma and
say multi colon
true okay saying multic colum true that
you want to say hey I want to update
multiple search all multiple repetion
hit enter this time you can say it is
saying and match two and modify 2 that
means two records found and two records
are modified let's check there we go we
have got new manager is updated in both
the
location that's something which is
really awesome because this is how you
try to perform the multiple changes well
in our previous examples you see like
how we can perform the update part but
we have one more beautiful feature
available inside the moo TV and that is
called how exactly we can perform UPS
insert clear let's talk about upsert
upsert is a combinations of update and
insert let me try to show you one magic
here here when we talk about called
update
part you see now here we are trying to
say uh this
point yeah you see about multi true we
have used
now here this uh multi- true is we're
trying to update but let's talk about
something called manager
2 enter now you can see it is saying no
records
found clear now no records
found but there's one concept available
name called upsert upsert means if I try
to perform upsert it means if the
records are not available it'll insert
the record I want to show you one simple
example now here we using multi-
true okay so as I can see we're using
something called name and we are
performing this update part so in this
update part we using this dollar set new
manager so here rather than using multi
true we are
saying upsert true when I say upsert
true so what happened now they say n
matched zero and up inserted to and
modified with ID this that means when I
try to call this find function you'll be
seeing now we have a
got the another record has been added
are we clear now as a new
record so upsert does what upsert says
like if the records are
found I will update it if it is not I
will insert it that means if I try to
call the same thing manager to
fine it is added as a new manager now if
I just try to
say
uh not manager to I will call
QA QA and here we see empal to
newcore
QA and now you can see it is saying n
matched One n aborted zero and modified
one so it is clearly telling you like
hey I did not find any uh inserted part
but yes I matched one record I found one
record and the one record is updated now
that is very very beneficial feature
when you really want to perform upsert
so that is a advantage of upsert that is
what called update plus
insert very important feature then
depends on the requirement if you want
to add you can certainly add this so the
way we have tried to add this up certed
part we can also try to perform the
delete part also okay so mongodb also
helps you to perform the delete part and
how you'll be trying to add it now let's
try to understand here in my code if I
want to perform any delete part I have
this statement name called
DB dot the option we using it that is
know as called collection name
EMP uh new EMP
sorry dot we have option name for
remove in this remove we would like to
offer the
property okay and what we talking about
now here let's try to add the ID here or
the name which you would like to import
so I want to say like uh EMP name admin
new so we just
say p
name
okay and then name is called
what admin
new okay EMP name admin new when I say
remove you can see it is record removing
the first
record so you can see now the records
are
removed fine because there is only one
admin new is
available okay now in a similar way if I
try to
remove the property called uh newcore
manager
newcore manager hit enter now you can
see the three records are removed so
it's not like update which removes only
one sorry update only one record it can
also eliminate more than one records at
the same time that's the benefit of
remove so now you can see we have
already implemented some records as I
seen earlier like we have performed the
delete part
now now when I try to say
DB dot new EMP
doind three records are available with
Me 3 4 and six now when it comes to see
insert part we have seen update part we
have SE seen delete part we have seen
now it's time to basically fetch the
records so find function we've already
seen But in find function we also have
some conditions so-called queries so in
case if you want to limit the number of
Records into your application you can
also do that let's see DB
dot uh new
EMP dot find clear now so in find you
can
also pick up the specific records too
like when I'm saying do find and here we
can just say Name
colon
admin
sorry here to put craes
it says there's no record with the name
called
admin because it is a EMP name not a
name so let me change back
to now I can see it finds one record so
like that you can also apply a condition
okay into your code now in a similar
line if you really don't want to offer
any
condition okay but you want want to
limit the number of Records to be shown
so you have this function available name
called limit two two means only two
records now you can see though I have
three records but it is only showing me
two records because I have limit those
number of Records into my
code also we can perform sorting in case
if you want to perform the Sorting in
ascending and descending order that also
you can also do so here rather than
saying limit we just put this option
name called sort and in this sort on
which property you want to sort it that
also you can mention so we can just say
EMP
name okay and using ascending order or
descending order so you can just
say minus one that go descending order
hit
now you can see it is showing in a
descending order now if I just say minus
one if I just say one that is showing
you in an ascending order so you can
pick up the specific property behalf on
which you can tell it should be either
on descending order or ascending order
so that option really works very
fine
okay so that's like how you can perform
the queries but remember one thing you
can
also sech search the records based on
their embedded columns too because if
you see in a previous records we have
some records added okay that is uh let
me try to say
show
collections I will call SL
student and
student okay DB
dot dot
find
okay you can see we have records which
are embedded records now if you want to
search the records based on their
embedded properties like I'm talking
about address there's one property name
called City fine so if you would like to
pick up those records these are also
possible so how you can do this very
simple so you say TV do student do
find okay so inside this find you can
provide the specific properties like my
outermost property name is called what
address so we are using this option
call address dot dot city so we say
city are we clear colon I'm giving the
city name called what Bang
clear let me close
this and that's
it okay so we have to start
passing another curly Braes here hit
enter and you can see now I find two
records because both the records belong
to
what Bangalore so I'm getting this City
Bangalore with me
that's really awesome like you can also
pass the city
accordingly apart of that we also have
the other details also okay in which you
can have the conditions based on less
than greater than or whatever values you
would like to make it is available and
possible okay so that's how the
conditions are satisfied
so suppose if you would like to pick the
users are we clear where the range which
you would like to consider so those are
also possible like you can see we have
this property name called what EMP ID 3
and
6 I just want to pick up only those
records whose ID is greater than what
two so what I can say DB do new EMP okay
dot find and inside this F we can say
the property okay so what's property we
using EMP ID we are saying EMP ID here
colon here we'll be using dollar GT GC
stand for what greater than colon we're
giving the value called what
one right close
this run you can see you have received
three records 3 4 and six in case if I
just look forward for higher than five
you will see only one record so greater
than that is called
GT okay same option if I just say LT you
can see we have found two records so
less than greater
than okay so that's how exactly you
offer
it okay and also you can provide the
condition soal limit
as I can say find EMP ID the way we
provide it so here I will not use less
than okay instead I'll be providing
another property let me show you
what so here in EMP ID whatever we've
taken so let me try to take the property
called find and here we providing
EMP ID and then and we using another
curly Braes and we're using Dollar in is
very important property Dollar in Colon
here you provide the details I'm saying
uh inside so the property is 3 46 we are
saying
3 comma
six close
this and you can see we got two
records which matched with three and six
that's the benefit of having this
okay everyone so in our previous example
we have already seen lot many activities
this time we are trying to offer you
something very interesting feature and
that is known as called working with
indexing see mongodb is one of the most
popular tool and one of the reason why
it is very popular because it is having
the facility of having indexing now what
exactly the index does so friends main
job of having this index is to basically
give you the concept of like how uh one
particular uh document which is huge
document in case if you would like to
perform any sort of indexing inside this
how you will be applying this so to
apply indexing into my code let's try to
understand why index is really required
without indexing and with indexing how
you'll be making a difference into the
code so to make it happen we would like
to insert some records to
confirm okay okay so what I will do is
in Step number
one previous records if I see I have
got uh 4 6341 depends on what earlier
records we had it so we had to call new
EMP so
db. new
EMP
doind so we have total number of three
records are available so it's okay we
can have this three records with me
now let me try to apply indexing without
indexing if I want to find a result what
outcome I'm going to receive so to know
about how much time it going to be
taking if if I have a got large number
of records with me I'll be using this
statement name called DB dot the name is
called New
EMP
dot explain and here I'll be using one
pre Define functionality called
execution
starts execution
starts okay now here after the execution
starts we'll be using
DOT fine we'll be using the first
property
here okay and um
what user you would like to find it that
you need to basically offer it so we are
giving the name called EMP
Name colon give the name
called uh
QA okay let's
close okay now when I pressed hit enter
execution stats is a predefined
functionalities which will tell me when
the query was executed what exactly the
query plan was hit enter and now you can
see lot of
details are available with
me like you can see par query winning
plan and everything one thing you need
to Remember by default here when I try
to run it says and return one Advance
one need time total everything it is
showing me but one important thing which
you will see
here
is total number of documents is scanned
so it is telling me total number of
document examined is three clear now and
return one that means one result is
returned and the total number of
documents examines three in order to
find this record just imagine a use case
here when I say total number of
documents examin three in case if I have
got millions of Records with me that
means to search the record it'll examine
all the Millions number of Records to
search the result which certainly going
to be taking huge amount of
time and that's where exactly when you
try to search the record fine when you
have no indexing is
available okay so you need to understand
one important thing is by default index
is applied on your underscore ID DB do
new
EMP yeah db.
do when I say db. new .g index is a
predefined function it tells me like Hey
by default index is applied onore
ID that's a fact because by default
index is applied onore ID not on the
other
properties so I need to identify which
of the properties are required to be get
indexes mongodb advantages it is
supporting multicolumn indexes and
that's what exactly we would like to see
so let's see in our next demo now we
will try to apply indexing on our own
property okay okay so to apply the index
what we need to do we have to say DB
dot certainly we will be talking about
called collection name called um new
EMP
dot create
index here you have to pass two things
number one on which property you would
like to apply okay and it has to be
ascending or descending so I'm trying to
apply on
EMP name and I want the index to be
applied on ascending
order okay so
here colon
one hit enter you can see now it is
telling me like uh number of indexes
before one and number of indexes after
two that means earlier index was
available only on one particular
property now it is apply on two
properties if you want you can check now
you can see there's another property is
added called
empore now if I try to execute a similar
query which I executed
earlier QA now you'll be seeing there's
a different statistics all together here
if I
see in my code see it will tell you
total document examin one see now
earlier the number of document examined
were three but since this index is
applied now it is telling me the total
number of document examin is one so
performance is certainly
improved so to search your document it
won't be searching the complete
collections okay rather it will search
what only that particular column in
which it is actually applied for so
that's a benefit in fact I would say
when you will be using these kind of
indexes into your code okay
so hope we all are clear and understood
about this concept so let's go ahead and
get this implemented into our system
well this is the first way of how the
index can be applied so you can also
apply index on multiple
properties clear so that way will show
you one by one how it is okay everybody
so we have already seen in our previous
example how we have applied indexes in
our existing mongodb
application so it is also a
possibilities where we want to also
apply the index on other number of
properties too as you can see in our
existing
database okay and existing collection my
collection name is new EMP which
contains two different properties one is
called EMP ID and second is called EMP
name just now we have applied index on
our EMP name but in case if I want to
apply index on EMP ID I'll be using the
same technique okay let's try to apply
index on the same so first of all get
indexes I'm having this index applied on
two different property now we would like
to say
DB do
create index and here in this db. create
index we can
just I will say db. collection name so
our collection name is called New EMP
new
EMP do create index first parameter is
certainly the name of which property we
are applying so here we saying EMP ID
and in this EMP ID we will just offer it
has to be ascending or descending let me
decide descending
order so we saying minus
one okay now let's press enter and check
the status okay now you can see earlier
indexes which we have created that was
two and now it turns to three so it is
very clear that index is improving now
let's check this out uh DB
do new mp. getet indexes now we have a
total number of three indexes are
available so you can apply index or n
number of columns if you
want okay at the same time the the way
we have created the index in case if I
want to drop an index so we can also
drop so what we can do
db. new
EMP dot drop index drop
index and in this drop index we have to
provide which particular index we would
like to drop remember this point in case
if you're planning to drop any sort of
index so you need to provide which index
so you should have that particular index
name okay so here we are providing my
index name so it should not be uh I
would say the traditional name called
EMP ID no it has to be EMP
idore minus1 or EMP name underscore 1 so
this should be the name I'm saying
EMP name in case if you try this you see
it is saying index not found with the
EMP name because internally it maintains
with this name let's try this out we say
EMP
name _ 1 let's try and now you can see
new index was three okay
one
okay now you can see we have a call EMP
ID and underscore
ID so now we have only two indexes left
there's no EMP name anymore this is how
exactly you can drop the indexes so it
is very simple and straightforward way
of how in mongodb you can perform your
activities hello everybody and welcome
back in a previous examples of mongod DV
you might have
considered we have used lot many
operations in our last video we have
seen how to
utilize um indexing into our code now in
our next journey of our Mong TV we will
see how aggregation Works see in mongodb
aggregation plays a vital role and
aggregation comes with so many handy
functions with mongodb which will help
you to
perform and to apply some very simple
code Snippets into your
ongoing uh I would say the requirement
which can make your query so much
seamless now we will see how this
aggregation really works and to work on
an aggreg we have taken some default
database name called aggregate DB and
here we have a call student as a by
default collection in which we have some
set of records are already
added now if I just want to apply
aggregation now I would like to tell you
about what exactly the aggregation is
see ideally when you talk about called
aggregation okay so aggregation is
nothing but a call aggregate like rdbm
if you see we call aggregation there so
a unique command like you talk about
shell pipeline means the possibility to
execute an operation on some input and
use that output as an input for the next
command that means the output of one
particular uh execution becomes an input
for others so mongodb also supports same
kind of concept in aggregation framework
there's so many type of functionalities
are available which we will see one by
one into our next code
okay now here we want to confirm about a
few important things now here let me try
to bring some of the important
well-known I would say the
functionalities of our aggregation
framework first we use a term name
called dollar
project the project is basically
designed for
select a
specific specific fields dollar project
is designed to select what specific
fields from a collection we used to talk
about called what dollar match the match
is responsible to filter out the
operations are we clear now it is
designed to filtering out the
operations you talk about dollar
group talk about go dollar group so it
does the actual aggregation fine we talk
about call Dollar
sort okay it basically sort the document
okay like that there's so many
operations are available which we will
see one by one in our aggregation
Behavior now my first example the one
which I want to execute I have a called
student record with me which contains a
student name okay the
section and the marks and the subject on
which subject the person or the student
is appeared now here my first
requirement is we want to filter data
based on a section A because students
belong to the different sections as you
can see now it is a they belong to
different sections section A B C D so I
just want to filter the data based on a
section A okay so for filter out I would
like to use dollar match let's see how
it works so I just would like to filter
out only those students who belong to
the section A so how we would like to
use it now I will say DB
dot student
dot Aggregate and inside this we would
like to use this square brackets and
then curly braces and then use
dollar
match with this I would like to use
another curly bres and I
say section
a okay and I close this close this close
the square bracket close this okay so
db. student. agregate aggregate should
be always associate match is know as
aggregate functionality section a hit
enter and you can see now it lists down
all those students who belong to the
section
A okay very simple and straightforward
example exle now we would like to use
the second example so we want to find
out all the records where section is a
and we are using and operator marks is
greater than 80 there are so many
students who have a different marks like
17 19 and
whatever so we want to use both the
conditions together so how you going to
be using this now remember not only the
section A but also marks who are greater
than 80 so similar thing we have a call
match okay after this match we starting
this curly
Braes okay so after this match we would
like to bring
and we say dollar and and again colon
again we are starting this square
bracket
now okay we talk about what section a
number one
and uh after this the first curly braces
we would like to use marks we say marks
colon and once again they would like to
start curly braces and here we
use dollar GT that is called what a
greater than
colon
0 okay all are closed so you see like
here we have a got this square bracket
and round
brackets
so what else is
left so we have a called 80 we are using
another curly Braes needs to be closed
here and then square
bracket okay and followed by again curly
braces again curly braces again square
bracket again round brackets
okay let's see where it is gone wrong so
we're using this dp. student. agregate
we use
this yeah square bracket then curly
Braes then we use dollar
match okay after the dollar match we are
using another curly braces and we have
called and operator after this and we
have a
call this square bracket the then curly
Braes section
A after section A is getting closed we
using another curly Braes marks colon
dollar
JT okay and we are using what colon 80
after that we closing this and uh using
two more curly V square braet and this
okay so this where exactly you can
utilize that so db. student. agregate
and like this it'll be able to get it
now okay so in a previous example that
was the only missing point was after
this uh this dollar match we didn't
apply this curly
braces that was only missing point which
was there and now we have applied
another code is giving me this outcome
and I have only one user who's scoring
greater than 80 well that was the first
thing which we have it now along with
this I would like to go ahead and talk
about few more things now I just would
like to bring selective Fields not all
the fields like as you can see we have a
called student name section marks
everything I'm getting it so I really
don't want to bring all the properties
from this uh document I would like to
selectively take specific property
so uh let's talk about how we can use
this so we'll be using project you
remember about project is responsible to
select the specific record so I just use
this statement name called DB Dot
student okay
dot aggregate we using it now after that
now square bracket then curly Braes now
we are trying to say
dollar
project what we would like to use dollar
project and colon we are trying to use
student
name okay
colum okay remember one thing one means
I want those zero means I don't want so
whichever property you will be enabling
it by giving the one as a digit that
means it
is it is expected to be displayed so I'm
saying one comma I'm saying
section colum one okay and I'm also
looking forward for
Marks colon one that's it so
now you can see now I am once again
picking up only those like student
section and marks now if I go back and
remove some properties like I only want
student and section you can see I have
only student and sections are used
here if I just use this a statement name
call underscore ID colum
Z now you can see only the names and
sections are visible ID is not because I
really don't want ID by default ID is
shown but if I say a zero that means the
ID will not be visible here so like that
you can select the columns or the
properties accordingly that was one way
now the another thing I would like to
use what if you want to find out the
student name section and marks from
student once again we want to find out
the student name section and marks from
the student collection where the section
is
a okay so here it will be the
combinations of match as well as the
project how we can use this let's take a
look towards my
implementation if you see the previous
one what we have used
here you remember about we have used
this statement call aggregate
match okay so now we would like to go
back and
utilize after this dollar
match this is the C Braes I'm
giving
section colon a
okay section colon a and after this I'll
close
this okay and close this
again again I'm opening it up by using
this option
called project
dollar project we're picking up the
project right now and here with this
colon symbol we can use again and SA
student
name student Name colon we using one
comma section colon 1
and
one marks colon one and
now closing
this now you can see I got those so the
requirement was
we want to find out the student name
section and marks from student
collection with the section is a so you
are not only using the
match okay but also using what the
selective details like this you can
implement
it okay that's where exactly the
projection really works so projection
gives you lot many opportunities which
you can utilize it for your own and also
it comes with lot many many predefined
functions like in some AVGN and all so
let's talk about those functionalities
too so this is the first thing which we
have seen aggregations are taking place
now in case if you would like to perform
the group like if I want to find out a
total marks Group by okay section like
each and every section I would like to
confirm the total marks in every section
then how I basically do that so let's
try to get this example also so
here let me try to go back and uh we
will not be using match here because I
would like to use the group part
so after this curly braces we want to
use
dollar
group okay that is called Group by in
rdb is how you use it here we use this
curly braces again here we are passing
this un
ID okay you have to provide underscore
ID in a group because you cannot skip it
that part you need to be always remember
you really can't skip dollar ID whenever
you're trying to talk about called group
this is a compulsory field you need to
have it after
that I'm using
this
section in this section we are saying
dollar
section cuz we would like to make it on
a section basis after this closing and
here we're using
what total
marks colon here curly
bra
again uh
dollar
Su okay colon on which have I want to
use it marks so I can say dollar
marks naming convention is very
important because it is a JavaScript so
it is a case
sensitive okay
then and we can see now section wide I'm
able to get all the marks isn't is an
amazing that's where exactly the
aggregations are playing very important
role while retrieving such kind of
Records so hope you clear about how we
utilize this together so in a previous
example we got it like how we are
basically taking this marks in my
application fine so we are clear about
how we are picking that up but what in
case if I would like to take a marks for
the specific
section so it is also possible so we'll
be using the same group but the only
thing is what we'll be bringing the
match between because here we are trying
to get the all the section marks but if
you would like to bring it only for the
specific section we know it very well
what we need to do so here before I talk
about called dollar group we can use one
more curly Braes
here okay so we can use this option
called dollar
match okay and here we are using
this uh option call section A
sorry here in dollar match we are giving
this
call
section colon here we giving
a so closing
this closing this followed
by the other areas like in group which
you want to start now so we can start
with this curly
Braes here enter and you can see now
only the specific section you're able to
receive the records and that's very
simple now okay so that's where exactly
you would like to perform and there's
another option like in case if you would
like to perform in an average suppose if
you want to fetch the count of student
in each section and total marks and
average marks as well as so total marks
as well as the average marks we want to
get it so how are I able to take it now
so it is very simple as you have seen
earlier also into our code how we have
taken called group _ ID section we
talking about section total marks with
the sum we also using this after that we
can also use the
average okay
so this is we have taken called group
uncore ID sum so here onwards we will
start so when we say sum marks after
that we can just put curly
Braes and uh we can just use
count okay and uh after this we'll be
using this colon curly Braes and
use
dollar
Su okay colon
one okay and after that I'll
put comma here and we
use
average and inside this average I will
use in curly braces we can say dollar
AVG okay colon of what dollar marks
very simple so curly bres is
closed okay so total how many three
curly Braes will be
closed one square bracket and round
brackets and now you can see you got the
average markings in each and every
section so just imagine how easy it is
for you to deal with the aggregations so
aggregations seems to be very very
simple simple approach provided by
mongod TV that really create a
difference of how the aggregation
changes the way how you react
to okay everybody so after going through
uh the idea of like how we can
utilize the concept of uh aggregation
it's time to talk about like
how when it works with mongodb mongodb
is properly known
for I will say for replication that is
called high availability and that
feature comes by default with mongodb
you really don't need to install any
software for this because it is a
build-in feature for the mongod DB uh so
when you download that it comes along
with this so no additional uh
configuration setup is really required
when it comes to the mongodb part okay
so let's get started and talk about how
mongodb can offer the replication see
the idea behind the replication is what
the idea behind the replication is like
you are replicating
it
okay so when you talk about called
replication you are replicating your
data to we to the multiple Childs so
here in mongodb we have one concept
available okay that is known as called
Master Okay and
slaves okay Master is one and there will
be multiple slaves okay so these slaves
where your records are actually stored
and this is a master which will be
responsible to replicate the data to all
its Childs when the request comes due to
that in case if one particular node
fails so automatically the data will be
taken from the another nodes that's a
beauty of having this master and node
slave process so to make this possible
we have a very simple option
available in mongodb we have a one
concept L called mongodb Atlas so there
we can go and get our cluster ready so
here we start with the concept name
called
 DB
Atlas let's search for mongodb Atlas and
here I see mongodb Atlas database as a
service see this is a free tool it's a
cloud environment where you really don't
need to install mongodb in your local
machine it is a cloud-based mongodb
support which is free to use with a
limited amount of space but yes for the
testing purpose that is the best
suitable so I can can start with the
start free or else I can say the login
here okay from there onwards I can go
ahead now it is getting
ready now this is a place from where you
can start working on your cluster see as
I've told you like initially when you'll
be working on
this mongod TV it will ask you to create
a cluster
initially okay since I already have a
cluster with
me okay so I really don't need to create
it and as a free tier it will not allow
me to have more than one cluster setup
ready so if I say create a new
cluster okay okay and I say by default
AWS okay and let me close on this
notification AWS you can select any of
the cloud provider and
uh 8GB Ram cloud backup cluster name you
can see now it is taking me
.54 per hour reason being because I
already have a cluster with me hence
more than one cluster is not allowed in
a free tier cluster so I have to cancel
this but you can go and create a cluster
the way it was offered there so if you
want to create you can just go ahead and
do nothing just select by default AWS
select your location okay give the name
of the cluster you want to give anything
you can give it here otherwise let it be
the by default name cluster and say
create cluster it will take a while
minimum 2 to 3 minutes depends on the
availability it creates a cluster for
you and your cluster once it is ready it
looks like that
okay
so here in this application you have to
go back and understand what is there in
a cluster when I click on cluster zero
you can see now here we have got three
nodes available one is called primary
node which is called Master as I
suggested earlier and now we have a
called slaves automatically when the
Clusters are created inside this mongod
TV by default it will be three note
cluster where the one will be the
primary and two will be secondary
based on your package whichever you have
taken it you can increase the number of
notes later on but as a free I'm going
to get or I will be receiving total
number of three nodes available here so
records whichever will be stored it'll
get stored automatically in both the
nodes secondary noes and from the
primary I can insert the record and
secondaries I can read the records
remember you can't insert the records
into the secondaries you can only insert
the record only in your primary record
secondaries are not
allowed to insert so this is your
replica set okay these are the nodes
which are available to you so when you
click on this primary
here you will
see it is telling you no data no data
available no data available nothing is
there because I haven't stored any
records as such so I just go back to my
cluster
so initially I would like to go back and
create few things now okay I would like
to go back and set up few initial things
at a time of creating the Clusters
because when a cluster is created clear
now so in that point of time no setting
is configured you have to do few
settings now first setting is you have
to put it remember the steps First Step
will be your network access so in
network access you have to go and you
have to say add IP address
and in this add IP address you have to
select this
option from which location you would
like to accept only those IP addresses
will be WID listed otherwise what you
can do you can see here in my options
I've have given 0.0.0 that means all IP
addresses are acceptable so all IP
addresses are
used okay so this you have to enable it
otherwise you won't be able to get this
network access from any third party
locations next you have to talk about
called database access which is required
for you to create a new user there
already some new users are created but
it is recommended that you to go and
create a new users here okay so you can
go back and add a new user so by default
it is username and password is given so
you can go back and create a new user
when I say add user you can give
the username as well as the password as
per your own convenience so new user I'm
going to create it that is know as
called SL okay user and here be giving
call uh admin 1 23 so SL user admin
23 remember this will be the username
and password I'm saying add
user new user is automatically added SL
user admin 1 to three
so once you have provided this network
access database
access next you have to create a new
data so what you need to do when you go
back to your statement okay network
access database access It'll ask you
like you want to create a new database
so I just go back to my project zero
there will be on an option collections
you have to go back and create a new
collection here
now it is retrieving the list of
databases now you can see there are
already some collections are there am DB
is one of the database which is there
demo DB is there lot many databases are
there so you can go back and create some
new database and connect through so I
just create database I already have a
simply learn DB with me user app is
already one collections I've created so
creating a database in collection is
very easy if I give you the quick demo I
say create database give the collection
name called SL
demo okay and give the username call uh
EMP s demo and employee I say
create now you can see SL demo and
create it is there with me so there's no
record right now and uh once it is there
ready so remember demo and employee I'll
go back to my uh code again project zero
and from here I can say connect because
I want to connect it so to connect it
from because your mongodb is already
there so you want to connect it through
so to connect it through we have very
simple option available you can just
click on this connect option multiple
options are there through sh
connect your third party application of
the mongod DB Compass so since I already
have a shed with me so Mac OS I
have this Mac OS with me so we can just
use this
line okay so if you have a window you
can select your window since I have this
Mac OS I'm selecting this line but I
need to replace with this uh you can see
this
username okay and you have to give the
username here I I selected this I open
my
terminal okay and uh this is I'm just
closing
this and opening
up another terminal here since I want to
connect to the shell now so what I
need to do here in this I'll just paste
that the command which I have it now
username is you remember I told you you
call some users which you have already
created let's check
here
user I
say user I hit enter It'll ask me the
password so I'm given the password
admin and now you can see it is
connecting with me to this
particular see now see it is connecting
me to this a particular replica set you
can see in a log it is telling you very
clearly
okay saying that it is a username 4.2
and you can see it is connecting with
your Shard cluster the cluster which is
created and this is where exactly I have
it with
me so I'm connecting with this
environment so primary is there so if I
just want to go back and uh say
show show collections so I can go back
and create a new collection here
okay so it's up to you now by default
collection which is an employee so I can
say TB
do employee
do
insert and now here we can just
add
name okay now you can see some exception
is
raised
so you
understand now you can see the records
are added into my primary cluster so if
I just go back and uh go back to my
project 0 where we have
got
collections here you will be
getting
the SL
demo
employee loading the
documents so it takes time to get this
but this is where exactly you see the
records will be
stored okay so that's where exactly it
works fine for all of you so we have
this record okay so when I
say show collection so we have a call
employee I say DV
do employee
dot f so I can see we have got new
collection name called
this is added right now okay so like
this you have got the first connection
established and the records has been
inserted hey everyone my name is aan and
I welcome you all to this session in
this session we will have a look at the
basics of GitHub before diving deep into
the subject let's first have a look at a
used case the used case we will consider
today is a the world's largest Sporting
Goods retail brand
decathlon decathlon has 16 00 stores
spread in 52 countries with around
100,000
employees the IT team of GitHub consists
of 1,000 members that helps de catlon to
bring its Shoppers journey to their
devices so here we will first see the
problems that they faced and then we
shall see how did they sort out that
problem in the beginning deklon worked
on the data center with the help of a
VPN and using a VPN was a huge challenge
in terms of workflow visibility and
avoiding redundancies so the first
problem is how to maintain workflow
visibility and avoid
redundancies then since there are so
many stores located at so many different
places hiring of developers seem to be a
difficult task as a physical workplace
was always needed so the second problem
is how would they hire developers now
let's see how did dlon solve these two
problems one after the other in the
first case the entire dlon shifted from
any other remote repository to GitHub
GitHub turned out to be an amazing open
source Community as the code became more
visible across the organization and now
anybody could contribute to
it then let's talk about the second case
for hiring the developers as we know
GitHub is an open- Source community so
it helped in collaboration with any
developer all over the world the
potential developers could now
contribute to to benefit the global
Community now the question arises what
made this contribution possible so the
major contribution role was played by
the Version Control System this was just
a single case amongst many others there
are many organizations that have
benefited from GitHub now when we have
realized how GitHub has revolutionized
the market let's start learning more and
more about
GitHub as we move forth let's have a
look at what is Version Control System
Version Control System are the software
tools that helps in recording the
changes made to the files by keeping a
track of modifications done to the code
there is one repository and each user
has their own working copy the changes
are committed to the repository which
are possible to be seen by others the
two most important things to make
changes visible are you commit and they
update as we discussed it is a system
that keeps a track of different versions
of a file and hence a specific version
of a file can be called whenever needed
this makes the collaboration amongst
developers easy and also provides the
members of the team to work on the
latest version of the
file moving forth let's see what is git
now when we have learned Version Control
System the next thing we need to know is
what is
git git is the most commonly used word
version control system that helps in
tracking changes made to the files hence
we may have a record of all the changes
that have been made to a file and we can
also revert back to a specific version
git simplifies the process of software
development with the help of easy source
code
management git is not only helpful and
popular among developers but also helps
non-technical people to keep a track of
all the files they have been working on
get further helps in the process of
collaboration and permits changes made
by multiple people to all be merged into
a single
Source then get automatically merges the
changes so two people or two different
sources can even work on different parts
of the same file and later on merge
those changes without losing each
other's work this is especially useful
when the projects are really big and
many people are involved in it now when
we know what is version control system
and basics of Git it is time for us to
jump on the topic what is
GitHub GitHub is a service hosted on the
web where all the projects are stored
every project on GitHub has its own
repository and its unique URL git
provides a graphical interface to store
the files and helps team members to
coordinate on the project from
anywhere GitHub provides several access
control and collaboration features like
we keys and basic task management tools
for every project let's now have a look
at the features of GitHub the first
feature we will see is easy project
management GitHub helps project managers
and developers to coordinate better on
the project the work can be easily
tracked and updated which makes sure
that the project is on schedule and as
entitled second feature is increase
safety with packages the packages on
GitHub can be published as desired they
can be published privately or within a
community or can also be published
publicly the packages can be easily
downloaded from the GitHub to use and
reuse them next feature is the effective
team
management now as all the team members
can stay updated with all that's
happening on the project so this helps
them in staying organized and well
coordinated the pool request and other
modification tools make sure that the
team focuses on the code moving on the
next feature is improved code writing
with the help of GitHub the quality of
code has significantly increased now
with the help of gito command one can
review improve and propose new codes
along with that suggestions or
modifications may be discussed before
changing the original code the next
feature is increased code safety GitHub
uses code ql which is the industry's
leading semantic code analysis engine
this tends to find risks in the code
which other tools tend to miss the last
feature we shall see is easy code
hosting as the name suggest the codes
and documentations are hosted in one
place we also know that there are
thousands of repositories on GitHub so
each repository has their own set of
tools to release and host the code
finally let's have a look at the
competitors of GitHub there are several
competitors in the market here we have
just put the most common ones first is
atlan bit bucket then comes fug bugs
followed by suround SCM and gitlab then
we have buddy and finally followed by
beanock this session we are going to
understand who a full stack developer is
what are his desired skills the amount
of money he makes on an average per year
and finally I'll help you build a resume
for your future
endeavors first let's understand who a
fullstack developer is everybody uses
social media applications the main
reason we use them is that they provide
excellent user experience and
interface these apps work pretty
seamlessly all thanks to fullstack
developers a fullstack developer is
associated with creation of a product
from its start to finish he designs the
front end and the back end of an
application while ensuring its
efficiency reliability and other crucial
features now that you have a basic
knowledge of what a fullstack developer
does let's look at some of the desirable
skills of a fullstack developer first up
for the front end development you should
have a good understanding of HTML and
CSS HTML short of hyper text markup
language governs the appearance of text
and images on the screen it formats the
text as headings paragraphs or
popups CSS on the other hand is a
styling sheet it helps with beautifying
the content on your screen in the form
of font size colors and
spacing next crucial necessity is
Javascript it is a powerful client side
programming language mainly used for
enhancing user interaction with the
application it offers several libraries
and Frameworks like react angular View
and jQuery you need to be proficient in
one or more of these
tools next up we have Version Control a
Version Control basically records all
the changes made to file over time so
that you can recall them at any point in
time most predominantly used are git and
GI Hub G is a free and open-source
distributed Version Control System
designed to handle everything from small
to very large projects with speed and
efficiency on the other hand GitHub is a
repository that provides a user
interface for Git it provides features
like Fork pull and merge moving on to
backend skills basic knowledge of node
is essential node is the hottest
JavaScript runtime environment around
right now used by a ton of applications
and libraries if you're writing
applications for the server nodejs you
need to be familiar with the
environment next up is
python python is used for several
reasons when it comes to fullstack
developers the most common one being the
fact that it is better readable than
other languages like C C++ or Java it is
easy to learn and does not require a lot
of coding it also comes with many
libraries and Frameworks and has a
thriving Community for
developers Jango is a highlevel python
framework that performs actions like
authentication databased migration and
URL routing among others finally the
backend skills would require having good
knowledge of dbms some of the commonly
used databases are Cassandra mongodb and
Oracle database you should be able to
update the databases and retrieve
information as and when
needed a fullstack developer needs to
possess some basic soft skills as well
first up is creativity the developer
must understand the objectives of the
project and should create a product that
engages the target audience next up we
have strategic planning planning is a
critical phase in any develop velopment
life cycle the developer should process
the aptitude to strategically plan the
design development and implementation
phases this helps streamline the
process next up we have analytical
skills as a name suggests it's crucial
to analyze the information and make
decisions so as to maximize efficiency
now these are skills that one develops
when they're exposed to but a good sense
of understanding is
required problem solving skills are
again crucial to predict any errors and
develop a bug-free
application from the business
perspective as well problem solving
skills play a significant role in
ensuring the smooth conduction of
tasks and finally we have time
management skills the developer must be
able to meet the deadlines while
ensuring proper execution of his
tasks moving on let's look at the full
stack developer
salary in India the average salary of a
fullstack developer is about 5 lak9 ,000
rupees per anom in the US the average
salary of a fullstack developer is
around
$75,000 now if you wish to make a career
as a fullstack developer or wish to look
out for better opportunities a good
resume is key first let's look at a
sample resume for a fresh
graduate first up is personal
information mention your name and
contact information moving on to summary
write a few lines about yourself and
skills that you are proud of make sure
you keep the section brief and to the
point next go ahead and provide the
links to your LinkedIn profile GitHub
repository and blogs if any in the next
section mention the projects you have
worked on write a sentence or two about
the objective of your
projects moving on to internships
mention the name of the company you have
interned for along with your role
responsibilities and the time duration
again ensure that you keep it short and
simple this adds credibility to your
profile you can also go ahead and
mention the university you're graduating
from and your final graduate score
lastly mention your skills this is an
important section since you will be
judged based on your skills you can
first mention all the technical skills
that you're confident about mention some
soft skills and extracurricular
activities that you participated in now
let's look at a sample resume for an
experienced developer the personal
inform Remains the Same however in
summary you can mention your years of
experience and your designation in the
previous company go ahead and provide
the links to your LinkedIn profile
GitHub repositories and other links you
feel worth mentioning moving on to
experience clearly mention the name of
your previous company your tenure and
the designation mention the
responsibilities Your Role came with
make sure that you don't overe
exaggerate use short powerful words like
developed designed managed and
supervised mention any awards or
recognitions you have received this adds
a lot of credibility to your resume you
can also provide your academic
information like the name of your
University the year of graduation and
your graduate score finally talking
about skills prioritize them according
to the job requirement and mention them
in the non-technical skills section you
can mention a few soft skills that
you're proud of if need be you can also
mention a scar where they came in handy
if you wish to mention some other
Hobbies or activities go ahead and
mention them having said all this it is
vital to not lie on your resume make
sure the information you provide is
accurate and not misleading so first of
all we will understand how to add
programming projects to a resume and
then we will go through different types
of projects like portfolio project web
scraping projects apib projects games
e-commerce Etc we'll go through each of
these projects and understand why these
projects are important so having Web
projects on your resume whether you are
a new to coding or a season programmer
emphasizes your technical skills and
experience to companies while helping
you stand out from the crowd this
tutorial will teach you all you need to
know about choosing and presenting
programming projects on your resume so
let's first understand how to add
programming projects to your
resume so the recruiters and hiring
managers don't have much time to go
through the inter entire resume so in
order to make them notice the best
projects you have worked on you have to
include them in proper place in the
resume you can include technical
projects in your work experience section
so that the hiring managers can see them
when they examine your resume also if
you have the prior employment experience
include your programming projects in the
extra experience box you can mention the
description of the projects the
Technologies you have used while
creating the project and your
responsibilities and achievements for
the project you must include the most
important technical project you have
worked on and can also use the relevant
resume keywords in your programming
resume listing relevant programming
projects allow you to get passed through
applicant tracking systems so use proper
resume keywords by carefully reading
each job description and adapting your
resume achievements and experience to
meet the particular qualifications that
firms are seeking for so this was about
how to add the programming projects in
your Zoom now let's go ahead and have a
look at some projects that we can add in
the resume which will increase your
chance of selection during the
recruitment process so now let's go
ahead and have a look at some projects
to add in
resume so first would be portfolio
project so one of the easiest projects
to start with is a portfolio project it
enables you to demonstrate your
abilities and create a personal website
that is as simple as and as complex as
you choose if you create a personal
portfolio that you can immediately show
on the website it will be EAS easier to
deliver and showcase programming work to
recruiters including portfolio projects
on your resume can be especially
valuable if you apply for a creative
field such as design writing or
Marketing in these fields a portfolio
can provide a tangible example of your
work now next project to add in your
resume is web
scrapping companies will be impressed if
you demonstrate your Mastery of web
scrapping to scan and capture data from
a website web scrapping is a practice of
obtaining information and content from a
website it is especially prohibited to
do this for publicly unavailable domain
including a web scrapping skills on your
resume can be a valuable asset
particularly if you are interested in
careers in data analysis data mining or
software development web scrapping can
be a useful tool for collecting and
organizing data from a variety of
sources python web scrapping projects
are popular among beginners these days
our Channel already includes a python
web scrapping tutorial you can check
that tutorial the link will be added in
the description
box next we have API based project as a
web developer using search inputs is an
important skill to have so consider
adding an API to your list of
programming projects API or application
programming interface which is an
intermediate between software that
allows two apps to interact with one
another API provide an easy way to
retrieve and distribute data within and
across companies there are a lot of apis
available on the internet
including Twitter's API Amazon API and
various other apis creating an API based
project allows you to manipulate data
understand client server architecture
and obtain data from HTTP servers it is
necessary to have basic programming
knowledge to create this type of project
and it will take around 2 to 3 weeks to
complete this project now before moving
forward let me ask you a quick
question according to you what was the
main reason for Twitter to lay off so
many employees do let us know in the
comment section below you can take your
time now coming to the next project that
you must have on your
list games so games are an excellent way
to demonstrate your knowledge of basic
concepts and algorithms including games
on your programming resumee demonstrate
your knowledge of logic data structures
and algorithms a game project can show
showcase various skills such as
programming Skills game design skills
graphic design skills and project
management skills not only that using
game engine software such as Unity
Visual Studio or Unreal Engine you can
modify or develop an original game with
unique 3D characters and story lines
overall a game project can be an
excellent addition to your resume
because it showcases various technical
talents in great demand in the gaming
business it can also be a great
opportunity to demonstrate your
creativity and and passion for a game
development next project on our list is
chatbot chatbots are extensively
utilized to save time on the recurring
conversation on corporate websites
smartphones applications and social
media Pages a chatbot is a piece of
software that mimx human communication
or chatter via text or voice
interactions to make one you can use a
popular programming language such as
python Java or
PHP these are significant commercial
projects and the recruiting manager
would like to learn more about
you now coming to the next project which
is an e-commerce project so the majority
of the websites and application with
which we interact are an e-commerce
platforms and e-commerce websites is one
that allows you to buy things online
some examples of e-commerce website is
flip cart Amazon zato oo big basket
Growers Etc including an e-commerce
project on your resume can be a perfect
way to at your technical skills and
experience working on a complex project
depending on the specific role and
responsibilities an e-commerce project
can showcase a range of skills such as
web development skills ux design skills
project management skills and business
skills also so this was all about
projects to add in the resume if you
have any doubts regarding this video you
can put them in the comment section so
what's your opinion on our list feel
free to let us know if you missed out on
something important now we are heading
towards an HTML interview questions now
here a few questions like what is an
attribute in HTML so you can consider
the attribute are the properties that
can be added into the HTML tag and that
changes the way the tag behaves or it is
displayed okay so you can see here you
have a call Button okay so attributes
are added right after the name of the
HTML tag so button is an element form
it's not an attribute Okay so what is a
marku in an HTML file so marku is
something which keep on rotating okay
let's
say for scrolling down the text Page or
the text on the web page Mark is used
sometimes you might have seen when you
want to display some very important
information okay which needs to scroll
at the bottom or else the right after
specific period of time you always use
marku it is one of the very very
old element available under the HTML
page so it Scrolls the image AG top left
right center automatically everywhere so
you always use marku tags for rotating
it so the next is what is the semantic
and HTML see semantics or htmls are
nothing but to call another coding style
okay
so when you talk about a semantics so
they are basically reinforcing the
meaning of the contents like typically
you have seen we are using div and span
tag but a div and span tag really don't
make sense to to us as an HTML reviewer
unless I go inside those and get to know
about what they're really doing it so
semantics are nothing but these are the
standard tags are we clear so you can
see like here like bold tag is not
useful for the Bold statement as well as
the italic tag is used for for what for
the italic tag so instead of we are
using strong and EM tags are we clear
now so this makes more sense to
us now the next thing is how do you
display a table in an HTML web page so
obviously we have a got table tag and
under the table tag I can or align the
complete layout of my web page because
of table head table body table row table
columns there are multiple different
type of elements which are available
okay which are the part of table it's
just to basically align the content in a
proper format
what is SVG okay so SVG is basically
known as a kind of a graphic which is
written in a typical XML language the
svgs are the high quality Graphics which
doesn't tear off when you basically grow
and increase or Zoom so normally what
happens JF image you talk about jpeg
images after Beyond certain point their
pixel get data orated but here in SVG it
never happens so you go to any level
when you want to zoom and you're going
to get accurate contents at any point of
time okay so these vector graphics are
really typical 2D base diagrams and give
you the X and Y coordinates in a regular
systems next how do you separate a
section of text in HTML to separate a
sections of text in HTML we always use
what either
BR or else we use block code or else we
use what a paragraph tag so BR means
anyways it's separate out a
text and break the current line
paragraph is used to again write a
paragraph of text and the block quotes
is used to define the large quoted
sections okay next is how do you create
the nested web page in HTML so obviously
we have a different type of options are
available like an if
frame okay you me to say page within a
web page okay so we can create a page
within a web page with using iframe so
this are very very common questions we
Ed
to receive at the time of
interview okay the difference between
ordered list and unordered list so
ordered list will give you the different
ways to display the
data in Roman format in numeric digit
or else you can talk about like an
alphabetical order but the unordered
list completely unordered you don't get
any options like an ordered
list okay so the ordered list start with
O and unordered list starts with
UL okay so we have already seen the
difference between ordered list and
unordered list now it's time to talk
about our another typ type of interview
questions which is regards to your
CSS now in CSS interview the first
question they always ask you like how do
you add CSS styling in
HTML so we are different ways to include
number one we have a called inline CSS
where we use the element and within that
we try to add the CSS content that is
called inline CSS second is called
external
stylesheet okay where you can just use
as a secondary or the you know external
CSS file and just include it into your
existing HTML page okay that is a
additional file which you write it in a
CSS and you include it in HTML and third
is called which is the internal
stylesheet which you write it within
your HTML but the only difference
happens when you talk about external it
is reusable across multiple web
pages now the different type of CSS
selectors which are available so we have
a different selectors like a universal
selector which is available where use
asri sign and select all the elements
and offer the common style second we
talk about element type selector where
you have the specific element name into
your mind and you offer that particular
type of selector ID selector is
responsible to select the particular
element with is having the proper
ID class selector which starts with a
DOT
class okay and having the class name we
talk about decient selector so in
decient selector you basically you try
to select all the elements which are the
part of that okay so you are selecting
this container and under that all the
child elements of the Box okay so we
talking about like in what of your
decent selector we talk about called
child combinator so in this case you are
basically trying to select all those
which is the child of this container so
you are using this greater than symbol
of container dobox okay so selecting all
those which are having the child name
called Box available then you're talking
about a general sibling selectors with
this Tinder sign and finally we talk
about like an attribute selector where
you have a proper
attribute available to
you okay so these are known as called a
general CSS selectors followed by we
have a next question like in what is SAS
less and stylus friends these are the
advanced level of CSS used in the
industry so we talk about like a what is
a SAS which we talk about like in syst
statically awesome style sheet so we
also have a similar type of option like
in list and many more okay so it says
about the SAS saying that it is
atically awesome style sheet it is
basically taking the complete CSS to the
next
level so that is a third party website
but once again it is very awesome CSS
which can offer you the mathematical
functions as well as the reusability you
talk about less okay so we talk about
linear style sheet where you can see all
statements which starts with ADD theate
sign there in s every single variable
start with a dollar
sign then you talk about stylus it is
also a flexible CSS so it doesn't use at
the rate or dollar for any defining
variables we can just directly use this
with the name okay and use it at any
point of time so these are the three
very popular new or next Generation
CSS so explain box sizing property like
how you can offer the property for the
Box
sizing so here so Bo box sizing property
actually defines how to basically Define
height and the width of the box which
are calculated so you talk about a term
name called content box you talk about
padding box and you talk about border
box typic typically we use three
different type of box content padding
and Border box in a Content box these
are the default width and the height
which can applied to the elements
content which are there under the
content box okay padding box are here
you talk about the dimensions which are
added to the Box elements of the content
padding third which is available called
border box so here the dimensions added
to the content padding and the
border now what are the difference with
to hide the element in a CSS so we have
a different way either we can use
display none that means whatever is
there inside the Dom it won't be visible
to
you second option is visibility hidden
that is another property through which
you
can eliminate the visibility but the
thing is like it is not visible to the
user but this element is added to the
Dom and takes up the space but in
display none it doesn't load in a Dom so
somewhere to when you want to talk about
performance display none is anytime
better and second call position absolute
so this can be made to the appear
outside the screen so three different
options are
available next option what does that
important CSS mean so the important
keyword actually indicates that the
highest precedence and it overrides the
cascet
properties okay so like as you can see
here we have a call paragraph where we
have a color call important and there's
one ID name called thing color called
Green so when we talk about P ID equal
to what thing so it automatically try to
override the highest
precedence okay now what are the CSS
Sprites CSS Sprites is a technique where
you can basically take uh larger image
okay download in a single shot and try
to cut down to the pieces and utilize
the way you always
want okay so if you're using this small
small images
separately okay so to load those images
independently you would be making
multiple HTTP calls which can be an
overhead so it is good to basically
download a lengthy image in a single
chart clear and utilize them as per your
convenience within your
application so it is used to minimize
the loading time of your web page by
combining multiple smaller picture into
the single
image okay that's what the CSS Sprites
are so which properties used to
underline and strike through and the
overline text so we have this option Tex
stle text type text decoration text
transform okay so the text decoration so
the text decoration is the one which
will be helping you to achieve this okay
everyone so our next example is towards
focus on JavaScript interview questions
now here we have few questions are
available like what are the various data
types in JavaScript so JavaScript
contains different type of JavaScript
data types like if you think
about all different types which are
there generally
bite short int
long float double character bullan these
are all different type of data types are
supported inside a
JavaScript okay now going ahead what is
the call back in JavaScript so the call
back means is a
function okay that is passed to the
another function as an argument on an
parameter okay so what is a call back
call back means don't call me I will
call you
clear so the idea is like you are
passing the function itself as a
parameter to the another function
because the JavaScript is known to be
called non-blocking which never wait for
the code to finish it continues to move
on and due to some reason if your
function it's taking some time to you
know uh execute so JavaScript won't wait
for that particular function to finish
so you use call back to prevent such
Behavior okay that's called a JavaScript
call back now what is the difference
between function declaration and
function expression see this is called
function
declaration and you talk about a
function expression function declaration
is just to declare
a separate statement within a main
JavaScript code and you can be called
before the function is defined okay it
give you the better readability where
the function expression are always
created inside the
expression okay and it is created when
the execution Point reaches
it are we clear and it is used when
there is a need of for a conditional
Declaration of a particular
function now what do you understand
about the cookies in a JavaScript so it
is one of the very very common question
cookies are the one which is created by
the server stored in a client site which
is responsible to store all the
necessary client activities so that the
browser or the application give the
better recommendation to the
user okay so it is just a a small text
file which is stored in a browser itself
okay you want to record something about
a user activity you always put it like
that and you can also Define the expiry
time for the cookies okay as per your
convenience
to decide how long the cookie wants to
be there inside your browser if we do
not offer any time span by default the
cookie will get lost immediately the
moment the browser
closed next what are the closures in
JavaScript so closures are the
JavaScript is a feature where the inner
function has an access to Outer
functions variables and the
properties okay so you can consider a
closure has a three scope chains number
one it has an access to its own scope
that is defined within its cbris second
it has an access to the variable of the
outer function and also has an access to
the global
variables now the closure is a
JavaScript features as I told you like
which has has an access to the outer
functions variable simple example I can
give it to you is a function which is
known as called inner function and
there's a function defined on the top is
an outer function so it is having all
the functionalities exess of the outer
function in inside
it now what are the Imports and export
in JavaScript so import and exports in a
JavaScript is a very very common way how
in Java you use the term name called
import a package but in JavaScript it is
little different unless you export
something you can't import it okay so if
you want to access any of your files
Properties or methods outside of your
file you always use the statement of
import
and Export so here you can see you have
got one property like an sqrt which you
are exporting it and you have one
function which is called square there's
another function
called you can say diag which you're
exporting it and importing it just the
way you always want so that is how it is
importing and
exporting what is the difference between
undefined Undeclared and null in a
JavaScript see undefined means a
variable that is De but the value has
not been assigned yet that is called
undefined Undeclared means like it is a
null first of all we talk about null
null means it is an assignment value
that we can assign to any variable that
is meant to contain no value and
Undeclared means the variables are not
declared and do not exist in a program
okay that is called what UND
declared how to remove the duplication
from the JavaScript array so you
basically need to use the standard
filter methods okay this is basically
responsible to help you to analyze
whether we have some duplicates
available or not so we'll be using using
filter methods okay so these are
basically known as called array and the
current element and the index of current
element and by using the for Loop it is
an empty array is used for the storing
all the repeated
elements okay so these are known as
called a typical JavaScript discussion
which we have taken place multiple
questions are there which we have
already answered okay everyone so we
will go ahead with the next set of
interviews which is related to your
angular so angular is as popular like in
react okay so there are some questions
which are usually asked like what is the
data binding okay so the data binding is
actually the process which allows the
application okay to have some data
associated with
your HTML page from your typescript
classes or the vice
versa okay so the data binding is the
one through which you bind the data okay
so you can see here it says like angular
uses two data binding when the changes
happens in a model it'll be affected in
a view and when the changes happens in a
view it will affect the model also so it
is used
to typically keep the model and view in
sync with each other to have the data
interchange what is a typescript
typescript is a typical I would say uh a
language which is used by angular okay
to develop angular component Services
pipes decorators and multiple things it
is a super set of JavaScript and it
supports JavaScript libraries and apis
it is a pure objectoriented in nature
uses objectoriented principles better
development time pass to load and
additional features to the JavaScript
for
sure okay what is an aot compilation how
it is different from git aot stand for
ahead of time compiler which is
converting all angular and HTML and
typescript code into the JavaScript code
during the build phase before the
browser downloads and run the code okay
so
aot is far more faster and lightweighted
in the size just in time compiler is a b
default compiler okay so it is a process
where the compiling computer code to the
machine code during the execution of
runtime so this ensures the faster
rendering the browser it also known as
called Dynamic compilation are we clear
so when you want to develop this aot
compiler you always use hyphen hyphen
aot okay so here you always use git
compiler because that is a by default
compiler use when you say NG build
next what are the pipes and angular so
pipes means they are the decorators they
never change their default value but
just for the representation purpose they
change the values okay to look more
better the way they always want okay so
pipes are ready made or else it can be
customized created angular also comes
with lot many predefined pipes okay like
it comes with the pipe symbol here okay
so you can chain the pipes together it
can be provided with some arguments at a
runtime with the colon
sign okay now you pass the input you put
the pipe and get some result with some
decorated outcome now you can see the
pure pipes uses the pure
functions clear so these pipe doesn't
use any internal State and the output
Remains the Same as long as the
parameters pass to stay the same angular
calls the pipe only when it detects the
changes in the parameter is being passed
a single instance of the pure pipe is
used throughout the all
components okay so this is how you see
how the pipes are being used so we have
defined the pipe okay which is the value
called true and false for the pure and
giving the class by implementing pipe
transform so you can see here the impure
pipes for the say for every change
detection actually happens in an angular
an impure is called
are we clear with regards to the changes
in the input Fields okay they will be
calling every time so multiple pipe
instances are created for the same for
these pipes input pass to these pipes
can be mutable by default all pipes are
pure only if you want to make it impure
you always say like pure colon
true or pure colon
false now what are the promis and
observables in angular see promises it
is a typical JavaScript object okay it
it emits a single values at a time they
execute immediately after the creation
and not cancelable they are pushed error
to the child
promises okay with the observables are
only executable when subscribed to them
they won't call unless you subscribe to
them using subscribe methods so they
help perform operations like for each
filter and retry and everything when you
unsubscribe this they won't get called
and won't listen
anymore what are the form controls and
the form groups see the form controls
and form groups these are the two
predefined objects comes with your
angular so these all text
boxes from you take the input it may be
radio buttons it may be the drop-down it
may be the checkboxes are called form
controls okay so form controls is a
class that enables the validation for
every single input class whichever you
are creating it now so the check the
values which are touched untouched or
the dirty clear now we talk about called
form group they are basically forming a
group which under which you have a
called relevant Fields joined together
are called what a form group okay so
form group class represents a group of
controls like you talk about address
contains city state and pin code these
all three can be together called as a
form
group okay so the form group class
basically return true if all controls
are basically what the valid okay and
they are designed to provide all the
necessary validation
errors what is the eager and what is a
lazy loading okay so eager loading means
what it is a default module loading
strategy followed in an angular Eagle
loadings are used before the application
starts these are typically useful for
the small scale applications lazy
loading however is designed for
dynamically loads the features only on
demand this makes your application far
more faster so in a bigger application
we really don't make easy eager loading
because it hamper the performance and
you want only when the client asks you
want to use lazy
loading what is a string interpolation
in angular see string interpolation is
written under the double curly Braes it
is a typically one-way binding where you
get the data from the typescript classes
and display directly over your browser
it denotes with the curly brushes and it
it always display the data comes from
the component to the view well let's go
ahead with the next area that is called
working with reactjs interview questions
now as we know it reactjs is as
important as like in other tools which
you've already seen so what is the GSX
here GSX called JavaScript syntax
extension okay so this syntax extension
to the JavaScript in real reactjs is in
the way how you express to bind JS and
HTML together to result a
jsx Content so by using jsx you can
write structure in the same file that
contains the JavaScript code that is
something more Innovative way because of
that reactjs is creating a more buzz in
a
market so JX actually helps the making
code more easy to understand and debug
and avoids lot of boilerplate code okay
inside the Dom
structure now the next thing is what is
the virtual Dom see the virtual Dom is
representing a Dom in a memory okay that
is called virtual Dom so manipulating
the real Dom is much more slower and
costly Affair okay because you need to
repaint the Dom over and over the period
of time when the user changes few things
so when the state change virtual Dom
changes and only the objects which are
in real Dom
okay update instead of updating the
entire object so that makes your page to
be load far more faster okay so in
Virtual Dom what happens this is a real
Dom this is a virtual Dom so the orange
color portions which you're seeing that
is basically the changes which has been
made okay these are called Changed
object okay so virtual Dom is basically
compare it's to the previous state and
understand which area it needs to send
for the updates and avoid the other
areas okay that's what this virtual D
really works so what are react extension
react extensions are many like you talk
about like in flux it is a third party
tool which is responsible to attach the
State Management feature you talk about
react net which is responsible to
develop the hybrid mobile applications
in JavaScript so these are two very
popular and there are many more which
are available okay so like we talk about
architectural support you talk about
server side rendering okay so Redux and
there are lot many other tools are also
available so what is an event in react
and how you're going to create that so
react is basically offering the ideas of
handing the event very fairly easy so
that you talk about clicking anything
you talk about taking your mouse
somewhere so these kind of options
generate an event so for that we
typically say alert and you click on
this render you click on this button in
a curly braces you call the function to
trigger to event now what are the
components in
react so friends react components are
nothing but a call view okay like a
complex view can be divided into the
smaller portions a complex UI can be
distributed further to create more
better and reusable views clear so it
splits the user interface into the
independent pieces of code which can be
developed and
joins later on okay so that's how you
define the component in Ang react so in
angular and react in both the areas the
word component is very much used so the
component meaning is very simple you
talk about a
view so what is a state in a react so
state is a react is nothing but is the
one which identify what was and what is
now okay which stores the value for the
specific period of time which changes
and react is basically detecting those
so it is changing because of some
actions either taken by the users or by
the applications okay so it keep
tracking about all those States what it
was there like in I'm talking about an
incrementing a counter so that is also
the state available there okay so the
state object is always initialized in
the Constructor so it can contain Ault
multiple properties so this do set state
is used to change the value of the state
object and set state is
responsible to perform the shallow merge
between the new state and the previous
state now the state holds the data that
a component renders to the web page
certainly because every time the state
changes so it needs to be stored
somewhere so this is how the state is
exist as you can see this example here
in the Constructor we are defining the
super props and the states being
initialized and you're rendering the
states there are three different steps
are involved initialize the state render
the state and update the
states what is the higher order
component and pure component and react
higher components are the component
which are typically a function okay that
takes a component and return a new
component to you by manipulating few
things they're basically designed for
the
reusing okay so the high components are
typically a function that takes a
component and return a new component
okay so to in order to perform some
reusability a pure components are the
components okay is a variation of react
component that
doesn't that does a shallow comparison
of props and
state okay shallow comparison basically
checks what the equality are we clear
now so that's what the main job
going ahead what do you implement and
how do you implement react routing so to
implement a react routing react routing
also comes with inbuild uh react modules
and that particular module need to
import it
so here we Define the react modules by
offering the route path where you have a
call left hand side is the name and the
right hand side is a component which you
would like to deliver it now hello this
is Matthew and we're going to be going
through some of the simple questions
that you would be asked during a node.js
interview uh what we're going to do is
we're actually going to break out this
section into three key areas there'll be
beginner questions there will be
intermediate questions and advanced
questions and the expectation is as you
go through this video is that these
questions could be pushed together as
you're going through the interview kind
of think of it like this is if You'
answer the beginner question that you
would get asked at the beginning of the
interview with confidence and shity uh
then the client is going to then jump to
those intermediate and advanced
questions quite quickly and they're
looking for people who can help them
serve and solve their problems at that
more intermediate and advanced level so
let's just get started so the first
question you're probably going to be
asked is you know you know what is
node.js you know do you know what it's
for and essentially node.js is an one of
the most popular if not the most popular
open- source crossplatform
JavaScript programs um it allows you to
build out web applications that run on
the server it's extremely flexible it
allows you to implement a lot of
solutions outside of just the the core
programming runtime and it allows you to
build Solutions extremely quickly in an
open-source mindset for
devops it is used essentially for
creating client siiz web
applications we'll see this later on and
you may want to talk a little bit about
about using expressjs and how you can
build out apis uh to work with nodejs
and connecting to databases such as
mongodb and that is also really good for
being able to store um data intensive
applications that are asynchronous and
event driven in their model um and this
is important when you're talking about
creating applications that can scale
rapidly so you're going to then must be
asking you how does nodejs work well
node.js itself is actually built on the
V8 engine and the V8 JavaScript engine
is the same engine that runs JavaScript
in your Chrome web browser extremely
fast um it allows for um high output and
non-blocking through your IO input
outputs and is a single threaded event
Loop so you're going to be then ask you
know where can you use no JS and and the
reality is the applications for nodejs
keep expanding um but there are some
core applications that you can work with
node.js right now uh so such as web
applications distributed system and
network applications probably
referencing the web applications is a
really good starting point um because
here you can actually talk about maybe
some examples that you've done where
you're building out some of these web
applications uh indeed one of the things
that you want to be consistently doing
and prepering your AR ERS with is
examples of work that you have done now
it doesn't matter if those examples are
purely experimental or training examples
that you've done the fact that you've
actually worked with nodejs and created
a distributed system or a web
application is really valuable because
it shows that the person that you're
meeting with that you have knowledge and
understanding and practical experience
of applying the theory of working with
nodejs with the pr practice of working
with no.
JS so be asked about you know your
essentially the iio refers to the
transfer of data in and out of uh a
system and that's really it you know
there's a reason why Google calls that
conference iio it's the transfer of data
in and out of our brains at that
conference the application is same here
it's about moving data in and out of
systems through using node.js and that
every um event can be track
um whether it's on a physical device and
network or files within a system again
it's input and
output so let's go through and you know
you're going to be asked you know can
you explain the difference between
front-end and backend development and
this is a question that I can ask a lot
when I'm meeting with clients um you
people get really confused about what is
the difference between front- end and
backend development um bottom line front
end is what gets resolved inside of your
web browser or the app on your uh mobile
device back end is what gets resolved um
essentially um what we call the know the
back office or server side applications
but it's becoming more and more
synonymous for what gets run in the
cloud so web applications um really get
a lot of the functionality of a web
application gets run in the front end
and I think with CSS HTML 5 uh client
side JavaScript it's all going to get
run in the front end everything else
such as connecting to a database um gets
run behind the scenes in the back end
and so you know um anything that's going
to have like Graphics is going to be on
the front end uh apis are going to be
run on the back end and then just
finally some of the scripting languages
that use on the front end uh so HTML CSS
JavaScript those are all Common Core
scripting um languages that you would
use you can use Frameworks such as
angularjs and reactjs or Vue uh those
would be a frontend frame Works uh
backend Frameworks would include Java
PHP Python and nodejs are some of the
backend Technologies you could also
throw in there net as well I me it's
just a whole you know Litany of front
end and backend Technologies and
Frameworks that you can use um and this
is a actually a good point to kind of
explain the experience you have outside
of just working with nodejs but other
technologies that you've been working
with that potentially that the client is
also
using so another question you're going
to be asked when you're looking at
node.js is you know can you tell me
about npm and so when somebody asks you
what is npn the first thing you're going
to respond is do you mean node package
manager and the reason why you want to
respond like that is that you want to
qualify their question with
understanding that you know what they're
talking about but you want them to
verify that and so no package manager is
mpm and it's responsible for packaging
all of your modules that you're working
with in node.js and we have a whole
series of videos that we've done on
node.js and every single one of them uh
includes references to
mpm so you're going to be asked you know
so okay you've told me um what it is you
know can you go into a little bit more
um details you know you can provide two
main functionalities and so one of them
is being able to manage online
repositories of modules and packages um
so you can go to like search. njs
and you can find packages that you can
install Into Your solution uh such as
expressjs and it also provides a command
line utility that allows you to manage
uh your packages very quickly uh through
terminal window or command line I use
VSS code a lot Visual Studio code and it
has a command line utility built right
into it that allows me to interact with
mpm so what are some of the modules in
nodejs and so you know modules um in
nodejs they're essentially like
JavaScript libraries so you you can
think of some of the JavaScript
libraries that you may have used the
functionality is somewhat the same but
they're designed for node.js and to run
on the server and there are ways in
which you can go ahead and create some
of those modules so for instance if
we're creating a web server you can
actually use the require commands to be
able to require that the server be there
so the example we have on the right hand
side uh shows that we really do need to
have HTTP which is a web server we
require that to be installed and uh so
that if you're running that uh npm
package it will actually uh install the
HTP server and then uh you can actually
write some code to actually then listen
on uh the Local Host Port 2000 for where
you'd be running your
application and there are just you know
there's a whole bunch of modules that
come with nodejs right out of the gate
and here are some of the modules that
you have we also referenced just earlier
on HTP is a core module for running a
web server uh you have a utility
function that is useful for developers
to um assess and features within your
nodejs project you have a URL module for
any URL passing you'd be doing and uh
you also have uh stream which allows you
to be able to stream data in and out of
your system and be able to manage how
that's being worked and then ZB which
allows you to compress and decompress
files so that you can keep uh your
storage of files um to a
minimum so a question you're going to be
asked is you know why is nodejs being
preferred over backend Technologies such
as Java and PHP and particularly with
Java it's a very mature stable language
it's been around for more than 20 years
you know PHP um runs some of the the
most powerful and largest websites out
there such as Facebook so why would you
use node.js well the first response is
kind of a guinea but it is really fast
and if you watched any of the videos
that we've done on nodejs building out
Solutions and developing the solutions
you'll see just how fast it is um the
second is the really kind of the secret
source with node.js is the node package
manager and node package manager allows
you to install additional functionality
such as Express or as a database
into your solution really quickly and
there's over 50,000 bundles available
for node package
manager if you're building out a real
time application that's data intensive
and you need to have a p is quickly
developed then node.js is another great
is really the great solution for you
allows you to build out these Solutions
really
quickly and there is a easy
synchronization between the server and
the client due to the
codebase and then finally because the
structure of node.js is Javascript if
you are making the pivot from being a
frontend web developer to node.js it's
just going to make it a lot easier for
you to pick up node.js because you have
that common language of JavaScript and
on top of that JavaScript is the world's
most popular um scripting
language so let's talk about some of the
differences between angular and nodejs
and so U the reason why this question
may come up is the person interviewing
you is seeing whether or not uh you do
know the difference between a frontend
uh framework and a backend frame
framework and this is one of those
questions where you can go well there
are differences but the differences are
because they complement each other um so
angular is a front-end development
framework whereas node.js is a server
side framework other differences though
between the actual Frameworks themselves
is that angular is written in typescript
which is a modification of JavaScript
node.js is written in C and
C++ angle is used for building out
single Plage uh client side web
applications and so that's a key word
there is client side whereas nodejs is
about building out fast and scalable
server side Network applications uh so
uh again the two complement each
other uh Angus splits web applications
into the MVC model view control
components whereas no JS generates a lot
of database Gres it does more than that
as well but you can think of no jss that
glue to your
database so let's talk a little bit
about when you're connecting to a
database with no JS and so um you're
going to probably be asked you know what
is um the most popular database used
with node.js and there are a couple um
mongod DB is largely the most popular no
SQL crossplatform database MySQL is also
very popular and that's a more
traditional relational
database um you would go with mongod DB
for really more modern solutions when
you're looking at creating application
that's going to really scale into just
managing masses and masses um of data
that has to be uh created read updated
and deleted very very
quickly for some of the other popular
libraries that you use for node.js
expressjs is a very popular one um I
really like work work with the expressjs
allows me to build out web applications
really quickly um more importantly it
allows me to build out apis very quickly
and which you know apis are essentially
web applications themselves um but being
able to do that very quickly with a
framework like expressjs is very useful
U is an application that makes
connecting to a database really
easy so um here is an example of
expressjs which is a in itself really a
flex
but a solution that you can do lots with
and which is a more focused
solution um which allows you know to you
make it easier to connect to your
databases so you know what are the pros
and cons of working with nodejs there's
lots of ways we explained this earlier
on that you can actually build out
applications that run on the cloud why
would you you know what's are the pros
and cons so a pro is that uh node.js is
is extremely fast at processing an event
based model uh it really is fast a con
is if you have something that is a very
heavy computational task it's not so
good at that um now I will cavey at that
this is that node.js is getting better
all the time and so uh you might have to
be provide an example of what a very
heavy computational task is and that may
be uh
calculating a risk on a insurance
application against many many variables
that may be something that's seen as
computationally very heavy but what you
can do in that example is you can then
offload uh the task to another solution
that's designed for it and use apis to
pass the data back and forth Pro uh
JavaScript is uh used for building out
your applications with uh no. JS great
lots of people know J JavaScript a
restriction again this is evolving as
JavaScript itself evolves is that uh
when you do a callback you may end up
doing lots of nested callbacks um if
you're doing something that's very
complicated again another way around the
con and so this is one of the things
that I always look for is if you have a
blocker or a barrier how do you get
around that barrier and so for instance
when you're talking uh to your
recruiter you can say look the reason
why I use no JS is that it's fast it's
event Bas driven I can use JavaScript uh
there are some challenges um but what I
do to get around those challenges are
and that's where you can say that you
know you may run the complex script off
and you may write that in net or Java or
PHP and then use an API to do the
response back into node.js so you get
the benefits of Both Worlds but minimize
the investment in having to manage a
complex environment such as Java versus
a relatively simple environment with
nodejs uh the node package manager makes
it extremely easy to access just an
awful lot of functionality uh with over
50,000 packages there's a package for
that uh so from being able to have a a
tool that creates unique identifiers
that you might need to have for
generating content that gets posted into
a database through to being able to
connect to databases through you know to
running so many different solutions uh
the mpm package manager with its access
to so many different packages makes it
great for um getting access to all that
content now a con is working with
relational databases with node.js isn't
as easy as a nosql database now you can
do it and there are ways around that and
what I would do when this question comes
up is always kind of pivot to say hey
this is how you can actually then uh get
around building out that
application Pro for no JS designed for
streaming huge amounts of data in and
out a con is that node.js is single
threaded and so it can be CPU intensive
but again there are ways around that and
a good way around that is scaling Your
solution in elastic environment such as
the
cloud so what is the command used to
import an external library and so to
Import in external Library the command
is the required command and so an
example we have here is you can start a
variable and the variable is going to be
for HTTP and you're going to then
require the HTTP Service uh that means
that the application itself won't run
unless the external Library the HTTP
library is
installed okay so those were our
introductory questions for nodejs let's
kind of pivot and take a look at the
intermediate question questions that you
would be asked so what does event driven
programming mean so event driven
programming means that if something
happens something else will happen in
response so for instance if you click a
mouse that Mouse click is an event that
means something has to respond to that
event uh just think of it as cause and
effect it's just the basic motion of
physics so uh that's what event driven
programming means you also look at it as
a callback function uh so that when an
element is executed something will
happen in
response so what is an event Loop in
nodejs so an event Loop in node.js is
when you do an asynchronous call and uh
what that essentially means is that uh
you are sending out uh data and then
non-blocking input output uh from
node.js is pulling data back
in what is an event emitter in nodejs so
an event emitter has really two areas of
focus one is that it manages uh the
classes that hold all the objects uh
within your event and we have an example
of this on the right hand side and then
whenever an event actually is thrown uh
the functions are then called on that
event synchronously uh so for instance
we have in our example on the right hand
side we create an event and then we have
the functions and that executed in a
series from that
event so let's talk about the API
functions in nodejs so there two types
uh one is an asynchronous non-blocking
function and the second is a synchronous
blocking function and the difference
between the two of them is asynchronous
is that there is no structure to the
order for how the uh API is resolved
synchronous means that when the feedback
API is received you have to execute uh
the response in a series for how the
response is sent to
you so what is a package Json file so
the package Json file is at the heart of
our node.js U package when we actually
will initialize a solution a folder to
be a node.js uh package you'll find that
the package itself holds all of the
metadata that's particular to the
project you're working on such as
project name version requirements it is
you have to have installed in the root
of the directory for the project and
again look at uh any of the videos that
we have on node.js we do have
demonstrations within those videos that
actually then go through and break out
um how to create that root package and
you'll see how you can actually then go
ahead and update the instructions all
the metadata within the package so here
we have an example of what that metadata
looks like so again this kind of
continues that question of what is a
package Json file and you may be asked
you know what is the metadata and why is
it important and the metadata is a basic
Json collection of pairing of uh key
details such as name version description
and then the custom version that you put
so for instance under name you could
create a name for your project there
can't be any spaces uh what is the
version and description and what is the
main or starting path uh for the
solution typically that would be
index.js but it could be anything. JS
but index.js is typical simply because
index.html is the starting point for a
typical web
application so how would you use a URL
module in node J as so with the URL
module what it allows you to do is
really two things one is that it
provides the resolution passing of a URL
um for Utilities in your application and
then it allows you to U extend your
module with builtin uh Solutions and
split up the web address into a readable
format so in this example um we have the
URL and the response it would would give
for that URL which would then be a year
and month um and it would be in a
readable format so it would read out as
2020 and then the
month so what is expressjs now you've
heard me mention this a couple of times
in the video and we actually have a
separate video on expressjs um expressjs
is a web application framework that
allows you to build out Web Solutions U
for both mobile and traditional desktop
right inside of nodejs so it's very easy
to use um being able to install web.js
is simple as requiring Express to be
installed in the example that we have
here on the screen it's a full solution
of showing how to actually build out a
solution with web.js uh so in this
example uh you start off the first two
lines uh require Express to be installed
and install comes from node packet
manager then we have have a simple
application that will then send to the
browser window a hello world message
confirming that Express is up and
running and then the third block of
content starting with bar server
actually will Define the port where your
application is going to run so in this
instance uh the port is going to run on
Local Host and the uh Port will be Port
8081 and so you can actually go to Local
Host colon 8081 and when you do that
that will trigger the application that
will forward up the message hello world
and it's all coming from
expressjs so what are streams in nodejs
so streams are objects that allow you to
read and write data continuously back
and forth within your application and
there's really four different types of
streams there's readable writable duple
and
transform the readable one stream from
which data can be read uh the writable
streams that you can actually write to a
duplex is a stream where is both
readable and
writable and transform are streams that
can be manipulate the data while it is
being read or
written so how do you update and delete
a dependency so so say for instance we
want to install uh something like
Express so if you wanted to install
Express what you would do is you would
just write them inside of your project
um you want to go to terminal window and
write in the command mpm install
Express if you want to update the
dependencies within your node package
manager to update all of them all you
have to do is write the command npm
update all dependencies
and then if you want to explicitly
uninstall a dependency such as expressjs
uh that's using the uninstalled command
and so that would again be going to
terminal window and you would type mpm
uninstall
Express and again it's really easy to
create a simple server in node.js that
will run a simple command the HTTP
service is actually built into node.js
uh you don't need to use expressjs I I
typically use expressjs when I want to
do a web server because typically what I
find is that I will want to go and do
something more complicated but if you
want to do something that illustrates
just the core functionality uh within
node.js you can actually just uh require
the core HTTP service that actually
comes as part of node.js and then you
can actually then go ahead and uh tell
it to create a service and then to write
in plain text a command um or text
string such as this case it'll be hello
world and that would pop out and then
the final line is to then uh listen that
if you go to a web browser that's on
port1 127.0.0.1
so all the apis in node.js are
asynchronous which means they are
nonblocking which means you can run them
continuously um and scale around that
which is just fantastic it's one of the
reasons why no JS can scale so fast and
the a means that the apis can return
data send data after it's been called
and really increase the efficiency of
events as they are triggered within
node.js
so how how do you implement async and
node.js and so the example that we have
on the left hand side allows us to
trigger async and it's using the async
function and as you can see in this
example uh it's actually something that
can be done very quickly in this example
we're actually uh making a command to
logo host and an app that's running on
Port 3000 and then depending on what we
get if there's an error message uh then
we'll have error message go to the
console log which is the terminal window
and if uh we get a response to an
application uh then we'll actually get a
positive response which would be fetched
response uh so again very quick and easy
that you use the async function uh to be
able to build out and you to get your
asynchronous
code so what is the purpose of module
exports so a module export is a way to
encapsulate your the entire code for a
solution in a single package and a
single file and then you can then share
that with other developers so you're all
working from the same environment so
that wraps up our full course on full
stack development for 2023 we hope you
had a lot to learn and if you have any
suggestions or doubts please write them
