hey everyone welcome back to yet another
video by simply learn today we will
explore the facts and Trace passwords in
the it sector the cloud computing setup
bytes of real-time data brilliant
processing speeds securing your data
with the Best in Class 5 volts and much
more we shall jump into more details but
first let's understand the agenda for
today's discussion first we will get
started by understanding what exactly is
cloud computing later we will understand
the critical roles in cloud computing
then the important topic of today's
session that is salaries for different
roles in cloud computing and finally how
simply learn can help you to get the
professional certificates in cloud
computing but before we get started let
me ask you a quick question you can
leave your answers in the comment
section below what is the main benefit
of using virtual machines in cloud
computing the options are increased
Network bandwidth improved scalability
and flexibility enhanced data security
reduce power consumption take your time
pause the video think and answer let me
know your answer when you're ready in
the comment section below alright so now
let's begin with our first topic what is
cloud computing cloud computing refers
to delivering on-demand Computing
resources over the Internet including
servers storage databases software and
other services it involves providing
these service providers who maintain and
manage the underlying infrastructure in
a technical sense cloud computing is
based on distributed network of remote
servers often called as the cloud we
should connect three together as a
single system users can access and
utilize these resources on a pay as you
go basis scaling them up or down as
needed this eliminates the need for
users to invest in and maintain their
own physical infrastructure as the cloud
service provider takes care of the
hardware software and infrastructure
management cloud computing offers
various benefits including flexible
ability scalability and cost efficiency
it enables users to access their
applications and data from anywhere
using any device with an internet
connection the underlying infrastructure
of the cloud ensures High availability
reliability and security having
discussed about the cloud computing
overview and its technicalities let's
move on to the scope of cloud computing
the cloud computing Market has
experienced significant growth over the
past decade and it is projected to
continue expanding in the coming years
according to the market research reports
the global cloud computing Market has
valued around 371 billion dollars in
2020 and this Market size includes
infrastructure as service that is iaas
platformer service that is passed and
software as service offerings the market
is expected to continue its growth
trajectory in coming years according to
the forecast the global cloud computing
Market is projected to reach
approximately 1 trillion dollars by 2020
E6 now proceeding ahead let's discuss
some critical roles in cloud computing
domain first we have the cloud computing
architect a cloud computing architect is
responsible for Designing and
implementing Cloud infrastructure
solutions they analyze business
requirements select appropriate cloud
services and Technologies and design
suitable and secure Cloud architectures
that meet the organization's needs the
average salary of a cloud architect in
India is 26 lakh rupees per annum and in

video let's take a minute to hear from
our Learners who have experienced
massive success in their careers
[Music]
when I won the Grammy Award back in 2007
I saw that was it that was the highest
point in my life
I eventually made a choice to drive
software development as my full-time job
and this year I changed my domain to
cloud computing simple learn scores help
me make the switch and get a new job
with a 100 salary hike
hey I'm Jorge I live in Georgia USA with
my wife two sons and two dogs
I started off as a video editor and
producer in Venezuela I even started my
own company there
in 2006 I work as one of the producers
and writer for the short music video
Bena Mikasa esta Navidad the video got
me the Latin Grammy Award in the best
video category for the year 2007.
my life was all set I shifted to the
United States with my wife and son in
2008 as a president with special
abilities
the first two years were really hard
there was no work I have to start from
scratch I landed some projects but those
were not enough
to survive I have to make some hard
decisions I have done some software
development in Venezuela
so in 2011 I got a job as a software
developer over the years I fell in love
with my professional
so last year to advance my career I made
another choice to upskill myself with
simple learns cloud computing bootcamp
in association with Caltech ctme the
word is rather than moving towards Cloud
technology and I wanted to have a
professional certification in the scene
the course proved to be very beneficial
I completed the course in June this year
and within three weeks I got hired as a
cloud engineer and my salary is just
doubled I got the job because of the AWS
and Azure technologies that I learned
during the course
do I have it on a full-time ID
professional I have not given up on my
passion for video production
it was hard initially but my work
eventually got me recognition and
acknowledgment since then I have worked
on several short videos and films like
the case against Mr Shepard verified
music in there and many more
my Mantra is never give up always try to
become better and keep your eye on the
price
with that we have come to an end of this
video on cloud computing salaries and
certifications
