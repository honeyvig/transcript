hi everyone now the topic of discussion
is on corticosteroids the important
aspect in your important topic in your
pharmacology so one of the important
questions asked from your former calls
you in your basics paper is this
corticosteroids so let's discuss myself
top society team MDS conquer so any
essay question if it is asked as an
essay question you have to write the
content so the contents actually include
the introduction the synthesis of the
corticosteroids and also the diurnal
variations the regulation and actions of
the pharmacal the are the actions of the
corticosteroids on the body and the
classification of the drugs and adverse
effects the uses and the adverse effects
so all and the applied aspects at the
last sign followed by conclusion and
differences so these are the contents so
as we discuss you can write the contents
ok so coming to the synthesis so
introduction you can write that the
corticosteroids play a very important
role in regulating the body functions
like that any interactive thing or
descriptive you want to put in you can
write so followed by the synthesis so it
is mainly synthesized by the adrenal
glands so the cortex and the medulla so
you have to write these zones and if
possible draw this diagram ok you have
to write the zones and the individual
things you have to write which are being
produced by the individual zones so
that's important so next you have to
write the regulation so if a person is
in constant stress I'll the
physiological or psychological or
environmental then the hypothalamus
produces this see Harris or
corticotropin-releasing hormone which
acts on the pituitary gland to produce
ACTH that is Ellen o corticotropin
hormone which again acts on the adrenal
gland to produce the cortisol okay this
is the HPA axis which you have to draw
this diagram if you draw it will be
really fetching and it will add your ad
marks to your answer ok and if the
cortisol levels are reduced then this
it's the CRH it sends a signal by via
biofeedback mechanism to the
hypothalamus and again it produces this
ER it's so it is like opposite again so
increase in this
which occur if the cortisol levels is
low and reduction in the CRH occur if
the cortisol levels are high it is how
so if the cortisol is more produced and
it sends a signal so the CRH will be
will reduce and our being opposite is
like if the cortisol levels are low it
sends the signals over this so that the
CRH is more produced by the hypothalamus
okay this is the HPA axis which you need
to draw annually you need to explain
next the diurnal variation usually it is
maximum in the morning hours that is
between 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. so again
for the night shift persons its opposite
so again it's minimum in the evening
covers so actions of these
glucocorticoids so you have to write the
individual actions so protein metabolism
it is actually for the protein make down
breakdown so for the retardation of the
grow the thinning and this curve the
skin and subcutaneous tissue so muscles
gets wasted if Eddy the cortisol levels
have to be in its own limit if then if
it crosses the limit then it can cause
more of protein big breakdown which
causes a message of the muscles leading
to the condition called as de steroid
myopathy and also it can cause the
thinning of the hair and for when will
wound healing and also very important
role in carbohydrate metabolism so this
line you have to put forward for this
that it promotes gluconeogenesis and
prevents the glycolysis so this we have
to write okay this is very important and
then for the fat metabolism so it causes
a redistribution of the fat at the
expense of the extremities and
centripetal distribution of the fat okay
so because of which the extremities are
thin and since if it crosses a limit it
results in a condition which is called
as a moon like phase Buffalo Hump okay
and the rupture of the skin occurs due
to stretching because of which the
purple striae appears on the abdomen
okay this are the important points you
have to put forward for the fat
metabolism of why the moon-like phases
occur why the Buffalo Hump occurs and
why this purple striae on the
okay because it plays a very important
role in redistribution of the fat X the
at the expense of the extremities and
centripetal distribution of the fat
occurs at the reason all these features
occur if the glucocorticoids are not
within their limits
okay next it also very helpful in
maintaining the electrolyte and the
water balance and in the blood plays a
very important role as well okay so in
the GI t it increases the gastric acid
and the pepsin secretion it also
decreases the gastric mucosal cell
proliferation and which tha's producer
peptic ulcer formation if it is not
within its limit and on the CNS excess
of glucocorticoids decrease the
threshold of the excitation of the
electrical stimulus of the brain because
of which it can produce convulsions so
these are the various pharmacological
actions so you have to put forward and
if you can draw this diagram of how it
has the of how it shows
anti-inflammatory and the
immunosuppressive effects that will be
really adding to your mark so draw this
if you can okay so how it shows
anti-inflammatory and the
immunosuppressive effects so coming to
the Mindel corticoids
so aldosterone is the most important
mineral corticoid which helps in
preservation of the sodium and the but
it maintains the water balance sodium
and a water balance so it's decrease if
there is a decrease in the aldosterone
then it causes hypotension dehydration
circulatory collapse and finally death
that's the reason it is called as a
life-saving hormone okay you can put all
these points and you can highlight so
it's mainly important for the sodium and
water retention so that you can put
forward so again if it is asked as the
essay question so for aldosterone is
better to write the when in angiotensin
mechanism so renin-angiotensin mechanism
you know if you can put forward this
it's very good so angiotensinogen which
is produced by the liver it's converted
to angiotensin one in presence of renin
which is produced by the kidney then
angiotensin 1 is converted to
angiotensin 2 by the presence of the
enzyme that is angiotensin converting
Zam that finally acts on the receptors
and produces this aldosterone by the
adrenal gland this aldosterone plays a
very important role in retention of this
water and sodium so that plays a very
important role in regulating the blood
pressure of the body so if you put
forward all these points that will be
really fetching for you okay so this is
how you have to start with the answer
and then you have to come for the
classification of the drugs so the short
acting drugs which in the
glucocorticoids the short acting the
intermediate acting and the long acting
so these you have to write it's very
important and the Mendel corticoids you
have to write okay so you have already
discussed the pharmacological actions so
these are the various adverse effects so
this is a mnemonic actually which if you
can try to remember this mnemonic okay
so the glucocorticoids a mnemonic hides
itself has its answer so glaucoma the
muscle atrophy the ulcers the Cushing's
syndrome the osteoporosis the cataracts
on systemic use and the osteonecrosis
and it's contraindicated completely
contraindicated in renal failure and
also in contraindicated in tuberculosis
and also contraindicated in congestive
heart failure the impair wound healing
the edema the infections and diabetes
mellitus and also suppression of the HPA
axis okay so how it suppresses is for
example if the cortisol levels are much
beyond the limit then as I said it sends
a signal to the hypothalamus so since
it's more than the limit so it sends a
signal to the hypothalamus to us to stop
the production of the CRH so there is a
reduced production of the crs because of
which the ACTH is also less produced
that the reason there will be no signal
that is to be released by the adrenal
gland so signal from the pituitary gland
will not be going to the adrenal gland
that's the reason it ends up with
adrenal insufficiency or adrenal crisis
so that's very important so that you
have to highlight so if the cot is all
or if the dark drugs dosages if you give
a more long-term usage of cortisol and
if the dosage of the drug is not
properly monitored then it results in
adrenal crisis because it sends a signal
to the hypothalamus followed to the
pituitary gland followed to the adrenal
gland so if the CRH is not produced then
again ACTH is not produced and finally
there in Erlang cannot produce its own
cortisol so the person will completely
be on the artificial corticosteroids
that we give that's not important
reliable so the body should also produce
its own corticosteroids that's the
reason when we prescribed
corticosteroids after a particular dose
it's time we give alternate day basis so
that on the alternate day the natural
simulation of the body occurs is a
natural production of the
corticosteroids occur so one day we give
are those other day the body produces so
this is how we have to maintain the HPA
axis and to read this is how you have to
prevent the adrenal crisis okay so
Cushing syndrome see I have an idea of
this picture and write the symptoms
that's the entire symptoms from the
head-to-toe see I have a look of this
picture and you can write okay and if
there is less number less
corticosteroids or decrease or
deficiency then it results in Addison's
disease so have a look of this diagram
and write the symptoms okay if it is
more than it results in Cushing's
syndrome if it is less or deficiency it
results in Addison's disease
okay so therapeutic uses in dentistry so
every question pharmacologic aspect
right their plight aspects so in
especially in dentistry it is used in
all these ways okay so especially for
the Aptus ulcers and any autoimmune
diseases like lichen planus
or edema multiform a prime figures all
these you can give steroids because it
has its very good property of having
anti-inflammatory action so for oral
lesions you have to start with topical
corticosteroids
so topical steroids are very important
so if it is asked in order medicine do
mention these steroids along with the
dosages the dosages are very important
for the oral medicine students okay so
you have to write this specific dosages
especially for the times in alone and
the club it is all these two are very
important so do note so 0.14 the times
point zero five four kilometers well
propanoic okay and again adverse effects
further topical steroids you need to
write so it could be the local hyper lie
like the bruising or derm electro for
your hyperpigmentation delay in ruling a
delay in wound healing and also fungal
and bacterial infections so opportunity
infections actually occur if there's a
long-term usage of steroids but topical
steroids will not cause much of systemic
effects so the topical effects you can
write so this is how you have to write
your answer applied aspects oral
medicine students they have to write
more so if you can write the dosages of
the drugs and individual autoimmune
diseases so autoimmune diseases
corticosteroids have the
immunosuppressive action so because of
which they can be used in autoimmune
diseases like lichen planus mem figures
SLE all these diseases you can write
okay and apart from that the Absinthe
ulcers you can give the time stone a
stone i topically 0.1% so you have to
elaborate your answer by writing your
applied aspects so not only the headings
you have to write individual description
of that particular disease and how the
corticosteroids act in that disease so
like that you have to enhance and
increase your answer that says so and
differences you can give your
pharmacological textbook the three party
that's enough the main textbook you have
to give that and work a textbook you can
give so like the clinical aspects have
taken from Burkett Kirk a you can give
okay any articles if you can give you
it's enough that's enough for this
particular chapter of corticosteroids
okay so main thing we're all diagrams
are required and we're all flowcharts
you can give if you can give those
that's enough so the heart of the answer
actually lies in the actions of the
actions of the glucocorticoids and the
mindell corticoids actions as well as
the classification of the drugs and the
important side effects the Cushing
syndrome and the the Cushing syndrome
the all those important side effects
from the head to toe and as a synthesis
so this is how we after start and end
your answer and finally the applied
aspects especially in dentistry so
that's it okay and if it is for oral
surgery students and it is again
important to write for the stress
management if you have to extract many
multiple extractions on one day then who
give corticosteroids as a prophylactic
use to manage the stress so like that
you can answer for the oral surgeon so
we're all related to your own particular
department if you write the applied
aspects it's very useful for you that's
it
okay thank you
