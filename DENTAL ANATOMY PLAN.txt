is dr srikanth from team mds conquer
now i'm just going to give a brief
glance that what we are going to
do in the upcoming few days and of
course in specific to
dental anatomy subject okay so going in
details into the contents okay so
uh in the in the upcoming few days of
the few weeks
we're going to cover the following
subjects one is a dental anatomy
okay so one is the first one is the
dental anatomy which is going to be like
a seven days
pattern then we'll move to the
biochemistry like dealing
for 10 odd days and then we'll move to
the community
okay dealing some 10 to 15 10 to 14 days
and of course in the middle we are going
to cover some parts of pharmacology you
can see pharmacology
chemotherapy part one and pharmacology
chemotherapy part
so my focus is very simple like in a few
days you're going to cover dental or not
you're going to cover biochemistry
you're going to cover the community part
and you're going to cover
the chemotherapy of pharmacology so it's
very simple like annot
according to the need i need blueprint
integrated need blueprint
they're given seven marks biochemistry
is going to be seven community is going
to be 14.
so apart from community if you go in
detail into the topics what i have
clearly stressed on so i'm covering a
part of uh
preventive dentistry also which is again
a part of pedo like your fluorides
and preventive dentistry or caries risk
activity tests careless risk assessment
your patent fissure sealants your arts
and all these
are going to be like a part of your pedo
so it's going to be like 14 plus and
your chemotherapy will definitely carry
two to
three marks so it's going to be like
somewhat in this range
but if you go and jump into your inice
team okay the rough
analysis according to me is going to be
as following that's your
dental and not will be in the range of
five to seven
biochemistry again will be in the range
of seven to ten
okay and your community is going to be
in the range of 10 to
15 and your chemotherapy will be in the
range of
four okay it's going to be four to five
or somewhere around three to five so
this is going to
be the rough plan and of course uh
stress clearly that
from may so in the month of may
okay so further may uh
we're going to cover the following
subjects in combination that is general
medicine
pharmacology completely physiology
general surgery and general or not okay
so this is a
this is going to be the rough plan of
action for the upcoming few
weeks okay i hope you're very clear with
mark's distribution according to the
need and according to the
according to the neet and according to
the i
and i see okay so hope
hope this this pattern is very very
clear and further we're going to deal
like
what we are going to do yeah now i'll be
talking about the dental anatomy so
dental anatomy the choice of book is
going to be
your whalers okay so welles is going to
cover the following things very specific
you can see dental anatomy
physiology and occlusion so occlusion is
again a combination of few subjects
that's going to be your ortho it's going
to be your pedo it's going to be
approach though
and it's going to be a dental or not so
this is very specific and very important
thing that you have to
learn at your best the following topics
are very very simple if you take
first first the foremost thing is the
difference between the deciduous teeth
and the permanent teeth and you need to
learn about
each and every teeth that are present in
the oral cavity all the 52
left and right and how you identify the
maxillary mandible left and right
primary and permanent so this is the
first important content that we are
going to do
in the first few days like first two
three days
so we will be focusing on the deciduous
dentition we will be focusing on the
permanent dentition
then we'll move to the next part that is
your calcification and direction
patterns sequences and everything well
elaborated in the videos
and the next one is occlusal concepts
which is a combination of few subjects a
part of occlusion is being covered in
your prosthetics
and now the upcoming things will be
covered i mean like male occlusion
classifications all the stuff will be
covered in your
in your orthodontics and but now very
specific a part of occlusion what is
ideal occlusion
such things will be covered out of
different types of occlusions will be
covered
in your dental anatomy point of view
then goes with the tempo mandibular
joint uh
physiological forms of the teeth okay
and all these are the miscellaneous
topics which will be done
and apart from this there are many other
miscellaneous topics that has to be done
from the textbook which will be done on
the day 5
a day for revision so this is what the
plan of action for da
and the book or the reference of choice
for the paper center
as well as for you me and everyone
is going to be the your card further
that is going to be your veilers
textbook of dental and not physiology
and occlusion
the next one is task distribution so
what we need to do like mds concur gives
you a multiple task
what you need to do my first preference
is it's very
simple like you can stick on uh your
preparation to
dental pulse synopsis okay so dental
pulse synopsis
so are well made okay are well made and
i want everyone before you start a
specific
chapter according to the schedule first
finish
the synopsis part in your dental pulse
i want you guys to finish the synopsis
part in the dental pulse
then second i want you guys to move to
the next part that is
your videos the video contents that are
available okay smart videos i want you
guys to finish the
smart videos content the second one and
the next
third one i want you guys to jump back
jump back
either to the smart notes okay a little
bit of smart notices which are missing
in other areas like which were covered
okay are being updated i want you guys
to finish the smart notes along with the
pp books
and you can finish the mcq part
in the dental pulse okay so this is what
you you guys
have to cover you guys has to cover is
i'll be sharing a pdf
which includes so many application based
questions
okay so nowadays you have more
application based questions in the
examinations
i'm going to share a pdf which
uncontained so many application based
questions like once you're done with
all the tasks like task one two three of
course
uh you have in the middle you have some
sort of daily
activities or daily activities on your
whatsapp group
so once you're done with all this doing
this pdf and application based aspect
a pdf which will be shared to you is not
a big thing okay so these are the
checklists that you have to make the
first is the synopsis i want you guys to
start with the synopsis of the dental
pulse
and next i want you guys to finish the
video content that is being prepared
prepared okay once you're done with the
video then you need to finish
the contents of smart notes the pp books
and the mcqs of the dental pulse then
attend the evening activity and of
course you can finish and polish with
the pdf
of which contains so many application
based questions okay this is this is
with any data plan
uh and checklist do make your checklist
first start with synopsis and again
repeating again and again
then go with the smart videos okay so
videos that are available on the website
then you can go with the smart notes pp
books
