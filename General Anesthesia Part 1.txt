have dippity this is dr. Marjorie from
team MDS confer so in this video I'm
going to discuss about the
classification of general anesthesia and
human cotton the general features of
that inheres tell anesthetics so if you
see this term anesthesia
this means irreversible loss of response
to a noxious stimuli and there are of
two types of anesthesia as all of us
know that local anesthesia which is
regularly used in our dental clinics
which in which their consciousness is
maintained but you take the general
anesthesia here we'll see their loss of
consciousness there is a term called as
balanced anesthesia so to call it as a
balanced anesthesia there are four
things to be happen that is
unconsciousness analgesia muscle
relaxation and abolition of compensated
reflex responses so if this four things
are present then it is called as a
balanced anesthesia if you take the
classification of anesthesia general
anesthetics this is of two types
where is inhalational and the second one
is intravenous and again this inhalation
is divided into a gaseous type of
inhalation agents or a liquid types of
in Harrisville agents so this cash is
inhalation agents in through nitrox
direct nitrous oxide into knocks I'm
xenon this xenon is an ideal or a noble
inhalational agent so if you take the
liquid type of in Harriston agents these
are all other examples so actually there
are many of this listed in here but you
can remember easily with the ending with
pain in so if the in most of these in a
liquid type of international agents
we'll end with the aim so if you take
this layer like chloroform
cyclopropane drilling ether halothane
and fluorine I so fluorine desflurane
co feuding and methoxy feuding these all
of the examples of liquid type of
inhalation aliens so if you take the
intravenous agents there of inducing
agents and the slower acting drugs and
this inducing agents in guilty
open tone methoxy hangs it on top of all
etomidate I'm hit a mine and if you see
the slower acting drags again the slower
acting drugs are subdivided into three
groups the first group is Bentley Pines
benzodiazepines which includes diazepam
lorazepam and midazolam the second
groups are like opioids which includes
fentanyl Remmy fentanyl Soufan Tennille
and alpha integral so you can remember
with this mill at the end and the last
group is of neuroleptic and the
neuroleptics example there is only one
drug in this category that is draw
peridot so this is the classification of
stages of anesthesia which is given by
the doodle so if you see this
classification there are four stages
here and again the third stage there are
four claims but in this thing you have
to remember one point that is first
plane and the second plane is that thing
Bar will do the dental surgical
procedures so if you take the stageman
of general anesthesia it is also called
as a stage of analgesia
and here this stage will begin with the
inhalation to the loss of consciousness
and pupil if you see the pupil of the
patient it will be normal and the other
features includes like patient is
conscious he'll be in a dreamlike State
reflexes will be normal and displays are
normal so all are not when only flexes
and respiration will be normal in this
stage one that is say the final is
easier if you take the stage two it is
called as a stage of excitement okay and
this stage will start from the loss of
consciousness to the gain of the
chemical respiration if you see the
pupil in the stage it will be large and
diverse and other features like
heartbeat blood pressure and muscle tone
will be increased but as respiration
will be irregular and there is the
involuntary movements can be seen like
micturition and the defecation can be
involuntary in the stage two of
anesthesia if you see the stage 3 as I
have told it consists of four planes
plane one two
three and four and in this four planes
the first plane and the second player
important because our dental procedures
can be conducted in these two planes so
if the stage threes of surgical
anesthesia where it starts or it extends
from on staff regular respiration to the
cessation of spontaneous breathing so in
the plane one there will be of roving of
eyeballs in the second plane you'll see
loss of cornea and laryngeal reflexes in
the third plane you'll see pupil starts
dilation and right reflexes lost whereas
in the fourth plane you will see that
intercostal paralysis and the pupil is
dilated here and in this other features
like muscle tone heart rate increases
but as blood pressure and respiration
will be decreased coming to the last T's
that is my de neri paralysis where there
is cessation of breathing then because
of this cessation of breathing there is
circulation failure and finally leads to
them death and if you take the case of
pupil pupil here it will be of widely
dilated pupil and muscles will be flabby
files will be of thready pulse and blood
pressure will be very low so these are
the four stages of general anesthesia so
coming to the general features of
inhalational anesthetics which we have
seen in that classification earlier so
we have talked about the stages of
anesthesia right so this stages of
anesthesia can be differentiated only
when a slow-acting a ginger used so this
inherited anesthetics have two important
properties that is maximum annular
concentration which is also called as a
Mac and blood gas partition coefficient
okay so here there are two important
points to remember one is potency that
is this potency of the drug is inversely
proportional to the minimum annular
concentration and the second point is
speed of on certain recovery of the drug
and this speed of onset and recovery of
the drug is inversely proportional to
the blood gas partition coefficient if
mini mark is of high for a drug then the
potency of the drug will be low
if blood-gas partition coefficient is
high for a drug then speed up on certain
recovery of the drugs will be low so
these are the two important things if
you see this make minimum annular
concentration it will measure the
potency of intra and the nitrous oxide
will have a highest mark as it has a
highest mark it is the least potent the
second thing is methoxy fluorine which
has a low mag as it has a low mark then
it is most potent drug then we'll come
to this blood gas partition coefficient
it will determine the speed of onset and
recovery so the fastest acting drug and
with a low blood gas partition is best
flooring and the slowest acting drug
with high blood gas partition
coefficient is methoxy Florence so these
two are irreversibly proportional and
these two are irreversible proportional
so coming to the systemic effects of
inhale additional agents
so first we'll see the respiratory thing
so in this respiratory thing the maximum
respiratory depression is caused by the
including whereas this actually this
inhalation agents will blend the
response to hypercapnia at hypoxia so
the agent which do this thing is
halothane
and this halothane is also having under
effect on respiration that is maximum
drunk or dilation is caused by the
halothane and the last is very important
all these inhalation agents reduce the
CVA activity but only if there is one
inhalation agent which will not reduce
that is ether ether will not reduce the
ciliary activity so a respirator is done
so we'll go with a cardiac now
so in this cardiac actually all this
inhalation agents will decrease the
cardiac output except to drugs that is I
so fluorine a - flooring and the maximum
decrease I mean the drug which decreases
the blood treasure in maximum amount is
isoflurane
whereas the increased blood pressure is
cyclopropane as this isoflurane
the black treasure it is a choice in
control hypotension but as this
cyclopropane increases the blood
pressure it is used in the patient's or
as a shock then maximum carrier
contractility will be seen with the
halothane and if you see the
baroreceptor reflex
it is blunted maximum with the halothane
and it is not blunted or it is not
affected with the eyes of Florence so
this is where the cardiac effects of
inhalation agents then coming to the
liver toxicity actually there are three
drugs which produce this liver toxicity
three inhalational so one is a a Harrow
tea
the second is chloroform and third when
is the methoxy fluorine then if you take
the hepa total i mean that
hepatotoxicity is done if you take the
nephrotoxicity nephrotoxicity is caused
by two drugs that is methoxy fluorine i
see what fluorine okay and this me toxic
fluorine is associated with vasopressin
resistant polyurethane and failure this
is very important to note why because
this methoxy fluorine is high in
fluoride content so because of this high
fluoride content it will cause the
vasopressin resistant renal failure and
why this fluoride is a during this
methoxy flow rain because this methoxy
program is highly inflammable so the
degrees that decrease the in
flammability fluoride is added in this
methoxy fluorine so if you take a black
night oxide will cause a megaloblastic
anemia and finally leads to the marrow
suppression also and coming to the
skeletal muscles maximum relaxation of
the skeletal muscles is with the ether
and remember all in Hoschton agents of
the skeletal muscle relaxants except the
nitrous oxide okay and in this system EK
effects you have to people have to
remember that what are the exceptions
where there is no muscle relaxation
where there is no decrease in blood
pressure and where there is no blunt of
reflex so this exceptional cases are
important and here there are four
important the general points that is
maximum analgesia is produced by the
trial in the good analgesia is produced
by the ether maximum metabolic effect is
shown by chloroform
but as ether and cyclopropane can cause
the hyperglycemia so if you take the
inflammation in flammability in
flammability which is the one of the
important feature of this inhalation
agent ether entropic cyclopropane will
have a highly inflammable hence they
should not be used when Cotter is done
or cata we should not be used when when
these two agents are used and there are
three agents inhalational anesthetics
like sevoflurane tri lean and methoxy
Florence they should not be used when
there is a closed circuit remember this
point because they and even these things
will have a these three three can react
with the soda line okay if sevoflurane
reacts with the soda line it will
produce the component a which is a
nephrotoxic whereas if thrillin reacts
with the soda lime it will produce two
agents two things that is dichloro
acetone and the forcing this dichloro
acetone is a neurotoxic and mostly this
neurotoxicity can be seen with the fifth
kind of seventh cranial nerves but as
the phosgene agent there is a RDS that
is acute respiratory distress syndrome
can be seen with this foster and the
last thing is methoxy fluorine when used
in the closed circuit it can revive
react with this rubber tubing which is
very dangerous are very inflammable so
hence these three things cannot be used
when there is a closed circuit so this
there are few gases which are filled in
the cylinders so you which are used in
the general anesthesia okay so this
cylinders are have been given with some
color coding which is very important for
us and if you see this nitrous oxide it
is given a color coding with a blue if
you take the cyclopropane
it is blue where a cyclopropane is of
orange then for the air cylinder it is
given with you can see in the picture
there is a grey and
right so this air is filled in a gray
color the cylinder with a white veins
and if you take the oxygen in this
oxygen also there are two colors that
means oxygen is filled with a black
cylinder with white wings whereas carbon
dioxide is filled in the gray color
cylinder and helium is filled in a brown
color cylinder and if you stake this
intern ox also there are two colors you
can see here so this is filled in a blue
color cylinder with a white things so
these are the very important things to
note down as the color coding is very
important to identify the types of that
cash is agents so this is this part has
been done and which explains or which
gives you a brief idea of the general
property of this inhalational
anesthetics okay so stay home and stay
well happy learning with MDS conta
