hey everyone welcome to simply loans
youtube channel in this session we will
be learning about how to create drop
down list in excel but before we begin
let me tell you guys that we have daily
updates on multiple technologies so if
you're a tech geek in a continuous hunt
for latest technological trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn now without further
ado let's get started with how to create
drop down list in excel now for that we
might want to switch to the practical
mode
now we are on our excel spreadsheet and
here you can see i'm trying to create an
calendar for the employees in the
company where you might have to you know
write down the day and month and year or
week of your birth date or maybe your
joining date or maybe also your last
working day right this might be useful
for all the employees to you know
avoid them from writing it down manually
so how do i create it so it takes a few
simple steps all it takes is some data
validation methods and also there is an
exclusive video specifically made on
data validation in excel link to which
is in the description box below or you
can search it on our official youtube
channel
now you can see that uh the word
calendar is on the first cell that is a1
but we have four cells below it that is
a3 b3 c3 and d3 so you might want to add
this to all the cells right like maybe
in the middle so for that you can do the
option of margin center also there is a
tutorial on version center about all the
options available in this particular
thing so you can go through that also
and yeah we have done the first step now
all we need is day month year and week
so in a calendar or in a month you'll
have days from 28 29 30 or 31 days right
so
let's create a list or the drop down
menu for that so that whenever you click
it right so whenever you click on that
particular cell you will have the list
of all the days available right so
let's get started with that
let's create a new sheet
so why are we creating a new sheet you
won't want that all the numbers in your
calendar sheet right over here right so
for that so we are creating a new sheet
and all the data will be available here
so here let's write down the days
first and here
the second number also you can use the
option of flash fill so that you can you
know
reduce the effort here so you can see
the flash full option over here all you
need to do is select the cells and drag
them down
until you get your required dates right
so let's keep it to
31 days like when you have the days
so these will be
your days and
here
now the next option was month right yeah
month and year
now using the same flash fill option you
will
you know add the months into your sheet
so this will be
sunday
so excel has this smart flashful option
where you can just drag the data and
everything will be filled according to
your requirements
so sunday to saturday
now the next one right that is your
month
so same as the before process will
create
january
and you can use the flash fill option
and all the way up to december now the
last one was the year
so
1990
and
1991
so you can select the cells and flash
fill up to
2022 maybe
yeah 2022 should be good enough
now this is the flashful option you have
here and also we have an exclusive
tutorial on flash fill all together you
can go through it for a detailed
explanation as well
now coming back to the original sheet
so this is where you create your
drop down list right so select the cell
where you want to add the drop down list
navigate to data and then here is your
data validation menu
so we have a variety of data validation
options over here there is an exclusive
tutorial on that you can go through it
for now we will look into the list
option only
because we want to create a drop down
list right so here it will ask for
source
click on the source here the source bar
right now navigate to sheet number two
where we have the days options
select the range
so this will be your range
and select ok
also you can add some message here right
what you can do is uh in case if there
is an error or something right you don't
want that to be happening so all you
need to do is uh
write down select from drop down
select from drop down only
so this could be a message select from
drop down only the title is
select options or just options
in case if there is an error you can
write down your title as invalid data
and you can write down the messages
please select
from drop down only
so
in case of someone tries to write as 32
or 33 to check the integrity of your
data validation then they will encounter
an error and an error message and then
they must be understanding
what exactly they try to do and if it's
correct or wrong right so this is to
make sure that whatever the data you
enter is correct and valid
so okay and here you can see select from
the drop-down list only options with
option list as title and let's try to
enter 32 right and when you press enter
you will see
an error
so the error messages invalid data
please try to select from drop down only
so you can go for a retry and select the
drop down right
so let's eliminate them and
now select something from the drop down
so let's take it as
maybe 10
right so this is how you clear the day
one now let's try to do with the month
same data validation option
settings will be
list
and source will be this one
i think i made a mistake here so let's
cancel this
and go back to sheet2 and draining this
as our week
yeah now coming back to the month again
it will be a list
and the source will be in sheet 2.
navigate to the sheet 2 and select your
range
and the input message the same
options
select from drop down only
error alert title will be invalid data
this one will be
please select
from
drop down
only
okay and that's done
now let's continue with here as well
let's quickly do the same
it will be a list
source will be in sheet 2
this is your list press ok
and lastly the week
same
process
it will be a list
source will be in your sheet too
the input message
options
title invalid data
it's drop down
only
right so your drop down list is ready
now so the month will be anything so
currently we have me
and er can be anything anywhere so let's
take it as 1997
and we can be
you know the the adjacent week and so
what was 10th of may 1997
let's check our calendars
it was a saturday
so it was a saturday and that's how you
create a drop down list in excel and if
you want you can also add borders to
your calendar
right
so that's how it's done
