link is provided in the description box
below so without any further delay let's
send over this session to our training
experts let's get started with today's
topic which is about primitive data
types in Java we are going to learn
about the primitive data types in Java
and we'll also see a short demonstration
of it so let's get started let's first
just learn about those uh data types
I've just opened the official Oracle
documentation and don't worry if you see
how this link appears here you can just
open a browser window and just type Java
primitive data types and if you hit
enter the first link which you will be
given is this particular link and this
is the same link which I have opened so
let's learn about the data types now so
Java has uh these primitive data types
which you can see here some of them
store numbers some of them store Boolean
values and some of them store characters
so the data types which store numbers
are bite short int long float and double
these six data types basically are used
to store any kind of numeric value let's
understand these a bit more bite is the
shortest possible data type value which
you can use in Java to store numbers you
can only store numbers with within the
range of minus 128 to plus 127 so you
can see the range is very small and Java
has created this variable for use cases
where you want to store numbers which
have very small value in this range why
do we provide these kind of options just
to save memory because the smaller data
type will require less memory to be used
in the Java program similarly the next
bigger data type is short which is a bit
bigger than bite and the range of this
particular data type variables will
range from - 32678 to +
32767 so that is the range for this
particular variable and you can see that
it has a it has a very big range as
compared to the BTE data type so if you
want to store VAR values which lie in
this range you can use short the next
one is int data type you can use this
one to store even larger values which
range from- 2 to^ 31 to + 2 to^ 31 - one
the next one is long which is even
bigger than int and it can be used to
store the values within the range of - 2
to^ 63 to + 2 to^ 63 - 1 so as you can
see as we go from top to bottom from
bite to Long the size of the value which
can be stored using this data type
increases and that's how you will
basically take a decision of whether you
want to use bite or you want to use
short or int or long based on what size
of the value that variable is going to
contain then the next ones are float and
double these two have been created for
the use cases whether where you want to
store the values numeric values which
have decimals which are Precision values
I should also mention that bite short
int and long are only used for storing
absolute numbers which do not have any
decimal representation even if you try
to store a decimal value in these
variables they will automatically be
trimmed the decimal values will
automatically be removed
and you will only be shown the absolute
values and in case of float and double
they can maintain those precision and
decimal values so we use float for the
use cases where you want to store
decimal representations of the values
and you can see that the float value can
store a smaller Precision value but
double can store even a bigger Precision
value so if you have really big
Precision values to be maintained very
big decimal values to be maintain you
should use double and the float is used
for storing a bit smaller size of the
Precision values I mean its range of
values basically beyond the scope of
this discussion if you want to read more
about this you can go to this particular
links which will explain this in detail
but the basic idea is that float is good
for storing two Precision values and if
you want to go beyond that you want to
use double in some cases some people
also use float to store even Beyond two
values as well so so it completely
depends the main the decision factor is
how long the value you are going to
store in the decimal and that will take
the decide whether you want to use float
or double the next one is Boolean which
is used for storing the Boolean values
Boolean values can be either true or
false so there are only two possible
values and then we have car which is
used for storing characters it is uh
using 16bit to store the value and this
is a very popular Java question for
beginner level programmers that why does
it store uh need 16bit to store the
character it's because it stores a unic
code representation Unicode
representation is a representation which
can be accepted across platforms across
the world in different character en
codings so let's move on to Eclipse now
where I have prepared a very short and
simple demo I'm just creating a variable
for each data type and I'm printing them
you also see some things here like the
these keywords and don't don't worry
about these keywords I will cover these
keywords in detail in the upcoming
lectures you also see this and you can
just for now you can remember that
system.out.println is used for printing
anything in Java anything you want to
print on the console you would be using
system.out.println what is system what
is out and what is print Ln again we
will cover these in the uh upcoming
lectures for now I'm just creating a
bunch of data types here variables here
basically I'm creating a cap type
variable a bite type variable a short
type variable an in type variable a
float type variable a double and a
Boolean the way you create variables is
basically you put the data type name you
put the variable name which can be
anything you put an equal sign and you
put the value actual value which this
variable is going to store and I've done
the similar thing for all of these uh uh
variables Java wants semicolons to be
there when you write your statements so
please remember that your statements
always end with semicolons so I've
declared all of these variables here a
bite a short and int float double and
Boolean and then I'm printing all of
them basically here I'm printing the car
variable here I'm printing the bite
variable here I'm printing the short and
so on so forth so how do we actually run
this application or this program you
just double click on this or right click
on this you go to this run as option you
see this run as Java application option
so you can hit this option it it will
run the application and it will present
all the output here in the console tab
let me just bring this up so you can see
all the variables have been printed here
and this is coming from these print
statements like I said this is used
system.out.print Ln is used to basically
print anything and I've used that to
print all the variables here first I'm
printing the car variable whose value is
a then I'm using the bite variable which
is denoted by B and whose value is two
so you can see the value is two here
then I'm printing the third variable
which is C which is a short type
variable which has a value 22 you can
see short and this is coming here the
next print statement is int so you can
see int here with the value 45 and this
value is coming from here then we have
float we can see the float value being
printed here and you can see the float
value declared here you also see an F
here and this is the standard naming
convention with Java proposes that
whenever you declare float and double
you end them with f or D based on
whether it is float or it is double then
you see the double value which is having
which is having a bigger Precision than
float so I've printed the double value
using this particular print statement
which is printed here and then we have
the Boolean value which is stored as G
and the value of G is true and the same
value is printed here so whatever I
write here basically is printed here
this is just a placeholder and this is
the actual value so you can see that we
are able to use all the variables here
all the Primitive variables basically
which range from bite character bite
short int float double and Boolean when
we talk about which all are the
non-primitive data types we broadly talk
about arrays we talk about classes we
talk about strings as well and we will
cover some of them in today's lecture
and we have the a detailed lecture
upcoming about the classes as well in
fact in the in the after few lectures we
we'll cover how we'll create classes as
well but for today's lecture we are
going to focus on string data type and
array data type and like I said for
classes we have a dedicated uh lecture
upcoming so don't worry about that and
again for this particular case as well I
have already prepared a demo for this
and we'll basically do some look at some
Hands-On examples to see how do we
create these variables what these what
does these variables mean and the first
non-primitive data type we are going to
talk about is string and before I go on
further I should also mention that it's
very debatable in the Java Community to
call string as a non-primitive data type
and actually technically speaking string
is a special data type it neither fully
lies in the Primitive category nor it
fully lies in the non-primitive
categories I'm covering this as as a
non-primitive data type because it's a
bit inclined towards the non-primitive
category why do we do this is because
Java does provide native support for
string handling in the jdk and that's
the reason some of the developers feel
that string is a primitive data type
which is primitively supported by Java
but at the same time string is so
customizable and it's so special in
nature it's the way it stores the value
the way it provides the operations and
handlings it's so different than
primitive data types that it cannot
fully be put in the same bucket as the
primitive data types so that's why he
said it's it's a special data type a bit
inclined towards the non-primitive
category so what is string basically we
covered about the car data type in the
previous lecture and in car data type
you can only store A Single Character
right but if you want to store a
complete name of somebody then it's a
list of character it's basically lot of
characters together then in that case
you would need a data type to store that
continuous sequence of characters and
that's what string does string can store
a continuous sequence of characters
technically string is basically a
character array you can call string as a
character array and don't worry if you
don't understand about the word array I
will explain that in the same lecture so
basically it stores The Continuous
sequence of characters that's how that's
how we Define string and you see this
string this is a basically the keyword
the data type basically in Java so
whenever you want to create a string you
need to write string with S capital you
need to give a name to the string this
can be anything and then you can provide
the value which is which this particular
string is going to contain so you can
see this is a continuous sequence of
characters t e s are the four characters
which the string is going to contain and
after that again I'm printing this
particular value and like I said don't
worry about this we'll cover this when
we when we'll write our first program in
Java so this is just to print the string
value I'm just putting a string
placeholder here and then I'm actually
printing the printing the values of the
string variable now string can be
created in multiple ways in Java this is
one way of creating it there's another
way of creating a string variable which
is this one which says again the string
data type some variable name a keyword
called new again don't worry about what
is this new keyword we'll cover this
when we'll talk about our running our
first program in Java and writing the
first program from scratch then we again
say string and then we provide the value
so if I compare this line number four to
line number seven you can see the
difference is that I'm still storing the
same value test but the difference is
that here there is no new string keyword
but here we have this new string keyword
so what is the difference the difference
is this that in this case in this
particular case string is going to re
use the same object multiple times but
in this case every time you call this it
is going to create a new object again
what is object it's just you can think
of it as for now you can think of it as
a memory block we'll Again cover objects
in details but these are two different
ways in which you can create string this
is generally the most popular way of
doing it because this is memory
efficient because you can reuse the same
variable again and again so I'm creating
the string variable here and creating
another string variable St Str one here
and printing both of them then I've
created this strange looking thing here
which is basically an array array like I
said is also an a non-primitive data
type in Java and array can store a
continuous sequence of anything that
anything can be a number that anything
can be characters that anything can be a
a floating number as well so basic idea
is that if you want to store a
collection or or sequence of multiple
multiple values how do you do that you
do that with the help of arrays array is
a data structure a non-primitive data
structure in Java which can store lot of
values of similar type we also call it
as homogeneous data structure because it
can only store same data type values or
homogeneous data type values so the the
biggest way to identify array is this
square bracket whenever you see this
square bracket in Java it means it's an
it's an array variable so here I am
creating an integer array variable with
the name ARR this is the name of this
particular array it is only going to
store integer values because I've
specified int and the moment I provide
the square brackets it mean it means
that it is an array so you can declare
an array like this and then you need to
assign a size to the array size is
basically denoting how many values this
data structure is going to store so I'm
saying new again it's a keyword and I'm
saying that okay create a a memory block
for storing two integers so this
particular array ARR can store at Max
two values two values at continuous
locations the next thing about array is
that it stores the value in a zero index
based location so like I said it can
store two values so the first location
will always be array of zero and this is
how you specify the location or index of
the element which is going to be stored
so at the zeroth location of this array
I'm storing zero the first location of
the array I'm storing one and this is
just to show an error scenario but I
will just comment this for now you can
just put double slashes and comment any
line so I'm just storing filling up this
array for two values and the two values
location would be zero index and first
index these are just continuous memory
locations and we denote those memory
locations as 0 and one array indexes
always start with zero and I'm just
putting some values here you can put any
values and then I'm printing the whole
array and I'm also printing the first
value of the array and we'll see how
this pans out and we'll also see how we
can change this so now we are going to
run this application so I'll just go to
run as and click on run as Java
application and once I hit that I get
this output here so let's understand
this output the first one is I'm just
printing the string which has the value
test test and you can see it has printed
here it is coming from this line then
the next line which is printed is line
number eight where I'm saying another
string Str str1 and Str str1 also had
the same value so you can see another
string has the same value and then I
have printed the array here the complete
array and you see this strange value
here it also tells us that if you want
to print the array then you cannot just
put the variable name and print it the
reason is because this is a non
primitive data type and once you do this
it is basically printing the memory
footprint of this array the whole memory
location where this array is stored
that's why you see this strange looking
number which is the memory hash code and
if you want to print any particular
value or any particular element inside
this array then you can do that by
providing the index location of that
element so here I've said that print the
zeroth location element of the array the
zeroth location array element of the
array was zero so you can see the value
zero here let me put some other value
just to just for fun and show you how
this works so I've just changed the
values and now let's see what do we get
for array zero you can see now I get
value three because now that at the
zeroth location the three value is being
stored and that is what what is being
printed here we can also print the first
value I'll just go run as Java
application you can see now the array of
first index is being stored which is
basically technically the second element
of the array but because array always
works on a zero index based value format
that's why when we say array one the
second element is printed when I say
array zero the first element is printed
so always remember that array is a zero
index based collection or data structure
basically what happens if I do this now
there is no third element in this array
because the array has the size only of
two elements and when I say ARR of two
which means I'm trying to print the
third element in this array which does
not exist so let's see what happens in
that case I get an exception exception
is basically an error I get an error
saying that index two is out of bounds
for length two it means that the array
length was actually two and index 2 does
not exist remember it's saying index two
not the element two index two doesn't
exist because only index zero and index
one exist this makes two elements and
that ual size is also two it does not
have capacity to store third element it
does not have third element location
anywhere that's why it complains that
you are trying to print a non-existing
value and with that we have come to the
end of this tutorial on data types in
