hi Venus this is dr. Steven from Team
MDS conquer now I'm here with the topic
trotting mechanism okay first of all the
most important thing is you need to
write down the definition of clotting or
coagulation
okay so plotting or correlation can be
defined as a process in which the blood
loses it fluidity and become a
jelly-like mass within few minutes after
it is shut out or collected in a
container so you need to go ahead with
the definition so once you're done with
the definition you need to write about
the clotting factors and I hope you
remember the common code of the mnemonic
that we used to follow in the lemon
standard that is foolish people try
climbing long slopes after customers
common some people have fun okay so that
is the core in which I hope you remember
that sixth factor is missing okay
so code is foolish which is F next one
is people
and it is the pee try 40
Clym b4c log for our slopes for us after
Andy
customers
against some people P have H fallen F so
this is the court if you remember this
code and you can restore this beautiful
table which is very very important so
once you are done with this you need to
write about the stages of clotting which
includes three stages that is the
formation of thrombo prothrombin
activator and conversion of prothrombin
to thrombin and conversion of fibrinogen
to fibrin
which is clearly given this is the step
1
okay that is prothrombin activator the
step 2
conversion of proteome into thrombin
step 3
formation of fibrin from fibrinogen okay
so you need to give a brief idea about
this that is the first step which is the
Protomen activator is divided into two
things okay one is intrinsic factor and
extrinsic factor and all these series of
reactions are very very important I am
going to give it very simple logical
code which you can return for a longer
duration of time about the intrinsic and
extrinsic factors okay so all these
tables has to be the flowcharts has to
be clearly given so that the paper
settle the paper evaluator will get a
clear-cut idea that you are very strong
in this particular subject
okay next important thing how to
remember the factors it's very simple
you can write it as the intrinsic and
the extrinsic okay so the intrinsic and
the extrinsic right so you can keep an X
in the center X means 10 so the left our
factors from the tennis it starts from
12 12 is going to activate 11 10 is
already there so 11 is going to activate
9:00 okay 9:00 is going to activate 8
and 8 is
activate them clear so which factor is
left over here seven is left or so seven
is going to be the part in the extensive
bathroom
okay so we are done with we are done
with ten which is the main one activated
both in the extrinsic as well as the
instant intrinsic pathways so we are
done with eleven we are done with wall
we are done with nine we are done with
eight and we are done with seven and you
know that six is absent so the leftover
are five okay four four is calcium and
two one okay so four two one
other leftover is right so by which this
is a common pathway and this is the
extrinsic this is the extrinsic pathway
and this is sorry this is the intrinsic
pathway and this is the extrinsic
pathway by which he can easily write
down the sequence of activations of each
clotting factor and the enzymes or the
substrate that are involved in this so
this is all about the basic clotting
methods and some application aspects
like which one whenever there is a drop
in this particular clotting factor you
can do this or extrinsic pathway is
related to which times like if it I take
about the blood picture you'll have
bleeding time clotting time for throwing
time activated protein time so there are
many such times which is going to
activate at which level if you mention a
table as an application plant that is
more than sufficient hemophilia is due
to deficiency of B is due to deficiency
of one Billy one factor all these extra
applications things that you have to add
of the power basing upon the time that
is available forever so once you are
done with this okay it's the second
important question which is related to
this or which you can write as an
application partes anticoagulants okay
so anticoagulant mechanism of the blood
can be divided into two factors that is
the physical factors and chemical
factors the notes for this physical and
chemical I'm going to provide you on the
group in the form of a PDF so the next
one is you need to write briefly about
the anticoagulants
Aquarians can be used to prevent the
blood clotting inside the body in vivo
and which prevents the blood clotting
that is collected from the body in vitro
or can be from both in value as well as
in brittle these are the three things
and this is taken directly from clay III
part and you need to mention this
classification that is what is parental
what are given oral because again oral
anticoagulants can be another question I
have seen this question most commonly in
end up in the papers related to endo
basics surgery basics and pareo basis
okay mostly these three people the
handle more blood and it's most commonly
asked question for the oral surgery
department okay so you need to write
about this classification in be line in
detail that is in direct thrombin
inhibitors direct raman inhibitors okay
so this is this is very very important
okay direct factor Xa inhibitor or
related thrombin inhibitors all these
are important okay so in this few things
few few few aspects we need to go
in-depth basing upon the length of the
question I feel this question cannot be
given for a twenty marks maybe along
with the clotting mechanism and
anticoagulants can be given for twenty
months as an application based question
specifically for oral surgery department
people but for most of other departments
it will be an individual question which
cannot be for 20 months so as it is not
for 20 marks you cannot describe each
and everything so you you can elaborate
few things like your her parents are
most commonly used right so you can
write some some important aspects about
her parent or some important aspects
about over firing because they are most
commonly asked or you can talk about the
C traits and all this okay so that is
important so before coding the article
what are the subheadings for example if
you are talking about heparin or if you
are talking about any other any other
particulars it rates or you can talk
about EDTA EDD is again used as
anticoagulant right so or you can talk
about
, and elevators so any of this make sure
you try to keep at least like to hitting
some basic introduction some basic
introduction introduction of the
particular is it followed by the
mechanism of action or you can write
about pharmacokinetics brief
pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics
forward by the uses uses of the
particular turk uses or uses of the
particular drug and the dose all these
headings are going to give more good
impression basically good impression and
more school-age senses from the person
who is correcting your pepper so once
you are done with all the source those
things because as this question is most
commonly asked for the surgery and end
of people I have coded two references
like before going to conclusion you need
to code such application based questions
you need to code at least two subject
related references or a small studies
over them like how we 70 coagulants
useful how authentic events affect - are
there any recent articles something like
if you are a barrier person try to
correct to parry or related and or 90
coagulants before if you don't find
pareo related go for general dentistry
no problem you can go for general
dentists like dental management of a
patient receiving anticoagulants this is
this is something related to general
dentistry right correct you can code for
oral surgery also right oral surgery you
can quote this for Perry also so basing
upon the question you can code a
relevant departmental related code that
is mandatory so this is is taken from
journal Journal of all sciences we hard
code everything and you please write
down and write some conclusion related
to this okay
and similarly is is the stopping of
antipodal interfere really requiring
minor dental surgery okay however in
pedantic micro surgery okay
I mean this particular article will have
some basic conclusion so write those
things in the conclusion and try to code
these articles which definitely give
some concepts definitely give a sound
confidence for the person who is
correcting your paper so that he will
definitely add extra scores for you so
once you're done with this I always said
before going for conclusion as a heading
okay you can keep the codings I mean the
previously I have discussed this you can
keep this as evidence based dentistry I
was talking about evidence based so you
can keep evidence-based dentistry
heading followed by you can quote two
articles related to your particular
department and followed by the general
references like general references one I
have quoted for KT three party that is
particularly oral anticoagulants related
classification and the second one all
the physiology must guide and gano
and your symbol in common okay so you
can quote this apart from these four you
can quote two articles I told like two
department based references okay two
department based references so totally
six are more than sufficient if it is
the twenty marks question if it is a if
it is a like ten marks or seven marks I
feel like three are more than like you
can go for any of these two followed by
one departmental based difference or
basing upon the time available because
finishing is always important right in
the dentistry finishing is always
important and I feel like finishing will
be mostly by the conclusion or the
evidence base reference heading to and
your references so this finishing is
going to give you the extra scores so
I'm done with this particular topic okay
