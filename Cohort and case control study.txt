hi Venus I'm back here to discuss one
more important topic related to your
community dentistry has already
discussed in the previous video about
different types of study now I'm going
to discuss two important studies which
are most commonly asked for us that is
cohort and case-control okay so it's
very simple that most of you have did
this at your best that the difference
between cohort in the case control study
is a star question for your final year
university exams and you simply know
that one goes in opposite direction like
cohort is quite opposite to the case
control in most of the situations and
most of the conditions so it's better we
learn one type of study and most of the
things are opposite to other study so
coming to the first aspect that is
cohort study cohort study and the second
aspect is the case control study so
cohort study is a four word study for
word study means simple I am going to
give a simple example that okay a
high-carbohydrate sticky foot a
high-carbohydrate sticky foot on taking
a high-carbohydrate for its sticky
furred
for a longer duration of time for a
longer duration of time for example a
five years or ten years which may lead
to dental caries this is hypothesis
which may lead to dental caries right
this is the hypothesis means this study
is moving forward so this is an example
of a cohort study means you are watching
a person or a group of people who are
taking high carbohydrate sticky died
every day our observation of five to ten
years there is a dental caries
occurrence similarly you can do this in
Reverse direction
okay you have selected a people who has
dental caries who has dental caries who
as dental caries and you've got the
history from them about their dietary
habits okay means you are going in the
reverse direction that study is called
as case control study cohort studies a
forward study it is also called as
prospect to study okay whereas case
control study is called as a backward
study okay
proper spell to study mean study which
is going backwards for example in most
of your questions they will give you a
study has started okay a study has
started okay in the year 2020 and we are
studying for the upcoming ten to fifteen
years for example ten years the upcoming
ten years that is 2013 means the dates
simply shows that the study is moving in
forward direction the study is moving in
forward direction this is a cohort study
similarly they are going to give a cases
were taken disease cases were taken and
their history was taken ten years back
from a hospital or from any other source
ten years back means if the dates are
going in a backward direction then it is
called as a case control study there is
one exception something called as nested
case control study that is called as
nested case control study means nested
case control study is nothing but a
combination of cohort study as well as
case control study okay
simply nested case control study is a
combination means is a combination of
both is a combination of both means you
know you are in 2020 okay for example
you are talking about regenerative
endodontics cases so already in a
particular department in the last five
years from 2015 to 2020 there were lots
of region at 100 region a day two cases
were done and similarly you are planning
to do hundred more cases from 2020 to
2025 so this study is going in forward
direction okay but you are collecting
data in backward direction also so it is
a combination of forward direction and a
backward direction that is called as
nested case control study okay that is
called as nested case control studies
the simple you can add a bird to nexted
case control study as as a study as a
study as a small case control study
which is nested in a cohort study is a
small case control study which is nested
that is the reason why it is called like
that which is nested in a cohort study
so are they can simply ask nested
control study is which type of study is
a cohort study because it's moving
forward it's mainly a cohort study but
you are collecting data in the retro
prospective direction also so it is a
case control study nested case control
study is is more often a cohort study
the major aspect is quad study as it is
moving forward but you are collecting
some data previously also so it is a
part of case control also mostly it is a
cohort study but a part of case counter
so don't get confused nested case
control means most of us feel that it is
a case control study no it's not a case
control study it is majorly a cohort
study with some amount of case control
study I hope you're very clear so they
can give us something like this some
example like this so you have to go for
a better option like nested case control
study because a study which is moving
both forward as well as backward is a
nested case control study I hope you are
very clear that nested case control
study is most commonly used for diseases
which are new or diseases which are rare
or techniques which are new for example
now in this particular example I am
talking in regenerative endodontics
which is a new technique or a condition
in which the diagnosis is impossible or
very expensive for example if you want
to go for diagnosis of Pulp vitality in
this case it is very difficult to
analyze the pulp vitality in this case
because we have very less equipment for
that okay so when to be done for this
study is the disease should be rare or
new or the technique should be rare or
new the diagnosis is impossible or
expensive in such conditions you can do
next or case control study hope you are
very clear with this right so I'll be
talking more about cohort study now and
you can learn the quite opposite is the
case control study so cohort study has
already discussed is a forward moving
study is a prospect to study okay so
what prospect to in 2020 okay you have
taken hundred cases and all these
hundred cases are being exposed to the
smoking predicting that by 2025 or by
2030 you are expecting parentage this is
your hypothesis that smoking is a
of occurrence of paradin titus and your
study is moving forward direction this
is your cohort study right I hope you
are very clear with the cohort study
they're few the main disadvantages
because as it is taking five years time
or ten years time as it is moving
forward the main disadvantage of this
cohort study is time consuming it is it
consumes it is it is consuming most of
your time okay
and most of the things has already
mentioned you're smoking the smoking
here as we have taken as a theology or a
risk factor you have some some keywords
which are used in this particular study
smoking can be called as a cause it can
be called as a cause or smoking can be
called as an exposure or the smoking in
this particular can be called as a risk
factor okay so if it is a risk factor
based thing it is called as the outcome
is called as effective means the
periodontitis is called as an effective
if it is exposure based things it is
called as out compared to entities as
outcome if it is a risk based thing the
periodontitis is called as disease so
the case control the cohort study cohort
study can also be called as
cause-and-effect to study can be called
as exposure and outcome study can be
called as risk factor and disease study
can be called as any of these these are
the other terms that are used for the
cohort study and as already mentioned
like what you are going to do in quod
study in this particular case in 2020
you have taken hundred cases and they
started smoking and you are going to
identify the parado entities and out of
which in 2021 you have identified two
cases developing periodontitis in 2022
there were four cases which has
developed in 2023 there were ten cases
in 2020 for zero cases in two thousand
I'm just giving an example twenty five
there may be 50 cases developing
periodontitis so every year there we you
are checking
number of cases the number of new cases
so the number of new cases are what are
the number of new cases in a particular
duration of time called as incidence so
this study is also called as incidence
study okay it is called as
cost-effective study it is called as
exposure outcome study it is called as
risk risk factor disease based study it
is called as incidence study as you are
getting the incidence and everything
okay so what is the what is the aspect
like you are just taking an explore you
are just taking the normal person who is
being exposed to the Carrey's sorry who
is being exposed to the smoking and
periodontitis okay similarly there may
be other factors also leading to
periodontitis smoking is one factor okay
there may be other factors also so how
you have to take this particular case in
2020 okay so there were few people who
were exposed exposure and you have to
take non exposure group also so you have
to take hundred exposure group to
smoking 100 non exposure group okay so
by 2030 by 2030 eighty people have
developed paradorn Titus who are smoking
and and the second category there were
only 10 people who are developing
paradorians they are not smoking but
they have periodontist that can be due
to any other reason so this is an
example that we are taking so you have
to take two groups for a comparison one
is the exposure group and second one is
the non exposure group the exposure
group here is the smoking the non
exposure group can be any other factors
so by taking this data if a particularly
this data is given that is most often Li
related to cohort study so with this
data you have to get the strength of
Association how to get the strength of
association is they are three important
parameters for getting the strength of
Association in cohort study they are one
is the relative risk the second one is
the second one is the attributable risk
the third one is the
population attributable risk okay the
three factors one is relative risk
second one is attributed risk third one
is population attributed is so these are
the three things which helps in knowing
the strength of Association the strength
of association between the smoking and
everything okay mostly the strength of
association is obtained by relay to risk
I hope you are very clear until this
point okay so now you have to compare
the other aspects okay what we are going
to compare first we are going to talk
about the really do risk okay so what is
related risk simply okay relative risk
is equal to you have to remember this
formulas incidence among the exposure by
incidence among the non exposure is a
relative risk formula so if you take the
relative risk formula for this
particular case incidence among the
exposure is 80 persons getting
periodontitis out of 100 so incidence
among the exposure is 80 by 100 and
incidence among the non exposure is ten
by ten by hundred so it is eight
percentage so not person s it is eight
okay the relative risk value is 8 so
what this 8 means means the relative
risk of smoking is 8 times more than an
on exposure thing to cause periodontitis
means smoking causes smokers causes
eight times more prone or relative risk
is 8 times more when compared with
non-smokers okay so what relator is
quali gives us relative risk well if it
is greater than 1 it gives a positive
association positive association
relative risk value 0 1 gives equal to 1
use there is no association means you
can conclude that smoking is not a
relative risk factor for occurrence of
periodontitis
if related risk value is less than 1
then it is called as a negative
association negative means it is a
preventive measure means smoking is a
preventive measure for occurrence of
periodontitis okay so now the value is 8
means more
one means smoking has an association
with occurrence of Parador notice how
many times 8 times occurrence that that
is that is what the relative risk is
going to give you so while you're done
with the first one that is relative risk
is over so we are going to the second
one what is second one attributable risk
AR right so we are done with relative
risk now we are going to talk about
attributable risk okay so what is okay
so next one is attributed risk so you
need to make a note about this formula
attributable risk is equal to incidence
among exposure - incidence among non
exposure by incidence among the exposure
in 200 make an or don't forget this
hundred because this is a percentage
okay
so what is the incidence among exposure
is eighty by hundred incidence among non
exposure is ten by 100 by incidence
among the exposure is 80 by hundred if
you calculate this you will get a value
of eighty eight percentage so what does
this attributable risk gives an idea
that smoking is an etiology the etiology
of smoking is eighty eight percent test
means the currents of occurrence of
parado entities in the smoking people
okay smoking people or the association
of the association of smoking as an
etiology is going to be eighty eight
percent is is the inference that is
given by the attributable risk so the
last one is population attributable risk
so the formula for population
attributable risk is incidence among the
total population - incidence among the
non exposure by incidence among the
total population so the total in two
hundred okay the total population is 200
here so incidence among the total
population is how many people are
getting the this more periodontitis is
ninety by how many people are there 200
right - non exposure is ten by hundred
by 90 by 200 so this is going to be
somewhere around 70 77 or 78 percent as
if you calculated okay so this is going
to give an idea if you prevent smoking
if you prevent smoking there will be
drop of 77 percentage of the cases okay
so it's a preventive measurement which
can be taken the entire population that
if you prevent this particular factor
the occurrence of smoking or the smoke
the periodontist will be decreased by 77
percentage so these are the three
important factors the number one is
relative risk number two is a our number
three is pierre so these are the three
parameters which we are going to get
with the help of a cohort study okay I
hope you are very clear so other
important things the the other names are
forward-looking study prospect to study
study which moves from cause to effect
study which moves from risk factor to
disease study which moves from exposure
to outcome this is also called as
incidence based study so all these
things which we have discussed and they
can ask you one more question the
minimum number of cohorts that are
required in cohort studies the minimum
two because you need to compare like one
exposure group one non exposure group
the minimum number of cohorts that are
required is - okay so you can ask me
that how the relative risk or
attributable risk or peer how where they
are used or how they are used for a
normal thing okay so relative risk is
most commonly used by the clinician by
the by the clinician normal physician
will will take this relative risk into
consideration and we'll explain the
patient that if you do smoking the risk
of getting the risk of smoking for
periodontitis will be 8 times so this is
how a clinician will use relative risk
most oftenly next attributable risk is
most commonly used by epidemiologist ok
innovative risk will be used by this
particular individual
when he collects a data whereas the
Pierre is something related to enter
population which is used by Public
Health Program Manager this person is
going to use that okay this factor is
how much influencing the occurrence of
paradorn Tidus in a smoker so in a
smoking population okay I hope you were
you were clear with concepts what we
have learned related to this so now we
are going to solve few important MCQs
okay the study of smoking for 10 years
and occurrence of periodontitis is
similar example what we are discussed so
you are you are planning to study the
effect of smoking to occur the para
donar this means it is simply going in a
forward direction you are not collecting
any information the answer is cohort
study how it can be a case control
studies you have selected the smokers
okay
a hundred smokers were selected hundred
smokers were selected and their case
history about the smoking in the last
five years was collected means then you
are going in a reverse direction then
it's going to be case control study the
second one calculate the relative risk
calculate the rate of risk in which the
incidence of the disease among the
exposure is twenty and non exposure is
four okay so exposure incidences given
us twenty incidence among the non
exposure is given as four so they're
asking to calculate the relative risk we
have learned the formal of relative risk
that related to risk is a ratio between
the incidence among the exposure by
incidence among the non exposure so
incidence among the exposure is twenty
non exposure is four so the relative
risk is okay the relative risk
valley is i hope you are clear with this
the next one attributable risk is
measured by so we have learned that
there were three association that we are
measuring one is relative risk second
one is attributable risk third one is
population attributable
so all these are measured in cohort
study so attributable risk is measured
in cohort study max activatable this
gives a brief idea but we have already
learned the related risk is going to
give how many times that this particular
cause is a risk factor for causing a
disease a typical risk will talk about
the etiology that for a particularly
theology which is which is causing this
disease in a particular group of
individual this percentage so we have
already learn about this so this talks
more about the etiology factor or a
factor in the disease right so thank you
for now signing off
dr. shreek on from team MDS conquer so
we have we have done different studies
and we have almost completed the case
control study and cohort study okay so I
hope you can manage which I mean when
they gave a description of a particular
study you can even clearly identify that
would study this is and of course you
now you can calculate the relative risk
attributable risk and the population
attributable risk and you have learned
some important advantages and the
disadvantages and of course please do
try to finish that the difference
between the cohort study and case
control study which is there either in
your shobun pater or parkour or the
Vivek chain of a change social medicine
I'm sick you poke any of these
beautifully given so all the differences
has to be you need to make a note
because most of your questions will move
around case controls and cohort study
for sure
