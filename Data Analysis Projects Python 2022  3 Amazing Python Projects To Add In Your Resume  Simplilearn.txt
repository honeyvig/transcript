hello everyone and welcome to this
interesting video on ipl data analysis
by simply alone
indian premier league that is ipl is one
of the most popular and exciting events
in world cricket
ipl 2022 will begin on 26th of march so
it's the best time for us and our
viewers to learn about how to perform
exploratory data analysis using the
recently held ipl auction data set
so in this video all the results and
insights that you will see are totally
based on the data we have collected from
kegel we will leave a link to the data
set in the description of the video you
can go ahead and download it
for this demo we'll be using python and
jupyter notebook to answer special
questions
so let's get started we'll move over to
our jupyter notebook
okay so i'm on my jupyter notebook
and this is the file that we are going
to use
so here you can see i have
some of the cells already filled in
so this will save us some time and we
can
explore this data set in depth so this
is the file that i'll be using or the
ipython notebook
cool
so first let's go ahead and import all
the crucial libraries that will be
needed for our analysis so here you can
see i'm importing the pandas library the
numpy library these are for data
manipulation and numerical computation
then we have c bond and matplotlib for
data visualization
then
i have imported this warnings
module
so that we do not get any warnings while
running the code
cool
so let me just hit shift enter to run
the first cell
so here we will import
all the libraries okay it's done
now the next step is i'm going to create
a data frame in the name of ipl
and here i'm importing the data set
using the read underscore csb function
which is part of the pandas library so
pd here has been imported as pandas i am
giving the
data set location followed by the name
of the data set so here the name is ipl
underscore 2022 underscore data set dot
csv is the extension of the file
so let me go ahead and run this as well
all right so now we have
successfully imported or loaded our data
set
now the next step let's go ahead and
explore our
data set so i'll use the head function
for this
ipl dot head
okay so here you can see the different
columns we have
an unnamed column which is actually
unnecessary for our analysis so we will
see how to drop this column apart from
that we have the name of the players the
base price at which the
player was sold or whether the player
was a draft pick so here rashid khan
from afghanistan pandya then we have
subman gill these are all
draft pick and then we have the
price at which
the players were listed in the ipl
auction then we have the
type of player whether the player is a
bowler an all-rounder a batsman
or
a wicketkeeper
then we have the cost in rupees this is
in crores so basically this column tells
us the
price at which the player was sold in
the auction
then we have the price or the cost in
dollars
after that we have
2021 squad basically
this means
in last year's ipl where was the player
so here you can see rasit khan was
playing
for srh the sunrises hyderabad in 2021
but this year in 2022 he'll be playing
for gujarat titans similarly hardik
pandya was playing for mumbai indians
for past few seasons including 2021 but
this season is going to play for gujarat
titans
so on and so forth
now
let's see the total number of players
that are present in the data set and the
total columns that are there for this
i'm going to use
the shape attribute so i'll write
ipl.shape
you can see here there are total 633
players that were part of the auction
and this includes the players who were
draft pick also
and there are total
eight columns in my data frame ipl
next
let's use the info function to check the
columns the data types and the total
non-null objects so i'll say
ipl dot info which is a function so i
have to use
brackets
there you go so here you can see it
saves total 633 entries from 0 to 632
data columns we have total 8 columns and
then these are the
different
column names and
here you can see the total
non-null objects
present in the column
and here you can see the data types
and at the bottom you can see the
memory usage as well
cool
now
the dot columns attribute will return
the name of the columns in the
data set so if i say ipl dot columns and
run it it will give me
all the different column names that are
present in the data frame
now as i said
the first column which is unnamed
colon 0 is
actually unnecessary so we are going to
drop it for that
we are going to use the
dot drop function and then i have passed
in my
column name followed by the axis on
which access is it there and then i say
in place equal to true which means it
will
replace
and permanently remove
they are named column from the data
frame so let's run it and now we'll
again check
the head of the data frame you can see
before we had the
unnamed column which was the first
column in the data frame and now we have
successfully removed it so player
becomes the first column in the data
frame
all right
now moving ahead
let's see the total number of null
values that are present in each column
of the data set so i'll say
ipl
dot i'm going to use the is null
function
followed by this sum function
if i run this you can see here
the player column doesn't have any null
values similarly base price and type
column also don't have any null values
but you can see cost and rupees and
cost in dollars have
nearly 396
missing or null values the reason being
those players were not
picked in the
ipl auction and hence there was no price
associated
and then you can see there were a few
players who were not part of the ipl
squad in 2021
so
those are being reflected as null as
well
now we'll check the
rows that have
cost in dollar as null or nan so here i
have
used ipl and after that i am passing in
the column name which is cost in dollars
and then i have used the is null
function
if i run this
you can
notice the
cost in
dollars column all these values are any
n or
null
and even the same
rows have
any n for cost in rupees as well
cool
now the
next task is to
fill these
null values or nan values with
zeros so for that i'm going to use the
fill
any function and here i have passed in 0
so all the null values in the data set
will be replaced with 0
for
cost in
rupees column and
cost in dollars column
let me just run it
all right
okay
now
we will see the players who were unsold
in the 2021 auction which means
we will check the rows that have null
values for the 2021 squad column
so what i'll do is i'll say
ipl
within
square brackets i'll say ipl and then
i'll pass in my
column name which is 2021 squad
and then after this i'll say dot
is null
so
this
cell
will give us
the unsold players in the 2021 auction
if i run this
you see here
you mark the 2021 squad column all these
players were unsold or did not
participate so hence it has any n values
all right
now what we are going to do is we will
replace all the null values
that are present in the
2021 score column with
not participated
like how we did in the previous example
we replaced all the null values with 0
here we'll replace with
a text value called not participated so
i'll say ipl
i'll pass in my column name which is
2021 squad
equal to
i'll say
ipl
2021
squad
dot
fill
any
which is the function and here i'll pass
in a
text or a string saying not
participated
all right
let's run it
before that let me just scroll it down
now i'll run it cool
now that we have treated the null value
successfully let's verify it again so
i'll just say ipl
dot
is null
and then i'm going to use this sum
function
if i run this
okay this is also a function cool now if
you see we have successfully removed all
the null values and replaced with either
zeros or not participated and hence now
you can see none of the columns in the
ipl data frame have null value so it
shows zero
great
now moving ahead
now we are going to add another column
called
status
which will hold two values
sold and unsold
but before that
we are going to
slice
our data frame so here i'm looking for
all the rows where
cost and rupees
is greater than
zero
and those should be unique and
i'm storing the value in a variable
called teams so here you can see we have
the different teams where the
cost in rupees is greater than zero
now
i am going to create
another
column called status so i have written
ipl
within square brackets i am passing in
the column name which is status and
that will be equal to
the team
replaced by
sold value let me just run it and show
you the result there you go
so here you can see we have added a new
column called status and it has values
sold
and unsold
if i just say ipl
at the bottom you can see
the unsold values as well
cool
now in the next cell
we are going to check for duplicated
players
so there are duplicate rows in the data
frame but here the names of the players
are same but in reality the players are
different
so
it is quite understood that
different players can have the same name
so
to get those names i am using the
duplicated function and i'll say keep
equal to false which means i don't want
to keep those players
now let's run it
there you go so here you can see
lalitha we have
two entries so lalithyadev here is an
all-rounder
whose base price was 20 lakh
for 2022 ipl
and
last year
he was playing for the delhi capitals
and this year also
he is
sold
to delhi capitals
next we have
lalitha
who happens to be a bowler so this is
again different
so last year
he was unsold and even this year he
remains unsold
similarly we have amit mishra
who earlier used to play with the delhi
capitals but this time he remains unsold
so on and so forth so you can see two
entries for subham shringa as well and
shivam mishra
all right
now
let's answer a very basic question
we are going to find out how many
players
participated
in the 2022 ipl auction
for that we have already seen
the total number of rows that were
present but again i am going to use the
shape function and within
square brackets i'm going to say 0 which
means it will give me the total number
of rows
and you can see 633 players were part of
the auction this is as per our data that
we have collected from kegel
up next we are going to find
how many types of players have
participated
so i'm going to say
types equal to
say ipl
i'll use the column name which is type
and i'm going to find the
count of
each type of players that are present in
the data frame
i'm going to use the values underscore
counts function
and then i'll say type
dot
reset underscore index
if i run it
okay there is an error here let me debug
the error
okay so this should be value underscore
counts and
the variable name is types are not type
so let's run it
you can see here
we have the different
types of players so all rounders there
are total 242 all rounders are part of
the auction then we have 215 bowlers 112
batsmen's and 64 wicket keepers
now using the above table that we just
created
i'm going to
plot my first
pie chart
so for that i'm going to use the
matplotlib pi function so plt.pi
i'm using
dot values since i want
only the values from this table
and then
i'm saying labels equal to types dot
index
i've used a label distance of 1.2 to
maintain some space
and then this is my format in which i
want to
print or show or display the percentage
of
distribution i am going to use shadow so
it says shadow equal to true which is
another parameter
or an argument and then i am going to
start my angle at 60 degrees
and here i have used a title called rule
of players participated
that will have a font size of 15 and
finally i'm saying plt dot plot
so let me just run it
there you go so here we have a nice
pie chart or a pie plot so you can see
the different pies here
we have all-rounder wicket keeper
batter and bowler
so majorly
there are all-rounders in the auction
followed by bowlers then we have 17.69
percent batters and 10.11 percent wicket
keepers which is the lowest
cool
now
we are going to create another bar plot
or a bar graph that will tell us how
many players were sold and unsold
so for this i am going to use a count
plot so we'll create two bars one for
sold and the other one for unsold and
each of the bars will have different
colors
one will have orange the other one will
have pink and i am using
labels so to label the x-axis and y-axis
i have sold or unsold by label will have
number of players the title of my bar
graph would be sold versus unsold i am
given a font size of 15 and i am saying
plt.plot
now the function that you see here at
the bottom
will display the data labels for each of
the bars
let me just run it and show you the
result there you go
so i have used a figure size of 10 comma
5
all right now you can see we have a
really good
bar plot which says there were total 237
players sold and 396 players were unsold
as per the data we have
cool
now
you can also
print
the total sold and unsold values let me
show you how to do it
i'll say ipl
dot we can use the group by function
and i want to group it by
status column
and
the value that i want to measure is
the player's
count
so i'll say players
rather player and then i'm going to use
the
count function if i run this you can see
here
i've successfully grouped the unsold and
sold players the values are matching
with
the bar plot that we just created so
sold where 237 players are unsold are
396.
cool
now
we are going to see the total number of
players bought by each team again this
is going to be a count plot so basically
a bar plot
so here the condition i'm passing is
in the teams column the value shouldn't
be unsold
so
players bought mints the value should be
sold so here i am using this condition
and the rest of the things remains the
same
one improvement i have done here is i am
using x6
rotation equal to 70 degrees this
basically means the x labels would be
tilted by 70 degrees
now let's see
the bar plot there you go so here you
can see i have the title players bought
by each team on the y-axis we have the
number of players
and on the x-axis you can see the values
have been tilted by
70 degrees let me just zoom in so that
you can see better
and this is the bar plot
so the maximum a team can purchase is 25
players some of the teams have also
purchased 24 22 and 23 players let me
just
show you so
gujarat titans have totally purchased 22
players
then
delhi capitals have total 24 players in
their squad
again
lucknow supergiants have 22 players
if i scroll and see again bangalore
loyal challengers or rcb they're all
challenges bangalore have
22 players in the team
and rajasthan royals and sunrises
hyderabad have
24 and 23 players respectively in their
teams
all right
now
we will create three more columns
called
retention
base price
and base price unit for that
first of all i am creating a new column
called retention which is equal to
ipl base price let me just run it
and then
i am going to replace
these values that are present in the
list 2 crore 40 lakh 20 lakh 1 crore 30
lakh 1.5 crore
with
from auction
and i'm saying in place equal to true
let me just run it
then we are going to
treat the base price
so here
in the base price
column i'm going to replace draft pick
value as 0 so let's run that as well
and now
i'm going to split
the base price
value into two separate values called
bree spice unit and base price so
basically i'm splitting
on the space
that i have let me show you how it is
going to split
so this is let's see our
base price column
what i did was i
replaced the draft pick values to zero
and then the rest of the values will be
split into two columns called base price
unit so basically it will have the
unit
of the base price let's say crores or
lakhs
and the base underscore price column
will have the value which is 2 here 40
20 20 so on so forth
let me just scroll down
and
run that particular cell
now to create
these two columns the base price unit
column and the base underscore price
column i have used the lambda function
and i'm splitting based on the space
let's just run it
now i have replaced
retained with zero
and
let me show you the
final data frame that i have
so here you can see we have replaced
the draft pick values in the base price
column to zero
and on the right side you can see the
three different columns that i wanted to
create
so one is called retention
so zeros refer to draft pick
any other value will say
the player was picked from the auction
then you have the base price
unit so here
you can see crores
lacks
and the value base prices 2
40 so on and so forth

description to know more
now
let's check how many players were
retained and bought from the auction
by each of the teams
so i'll say
ipl let me just scroll down
dot
i'm going to use the
group by function
then i'll
say team
comma
retention
then i am going to
use the value
as
retention because i want to find the
count of
retained players
then i'll say colon
minus 1. let me run it
you can see here
the different team names because i have
grouped by team and then retention so i
have chinese super kings
from the auction they had picked
21 players and they had retained
four players
coming to delhi capitals delhi capitals
in the 2022
ipl auction they picked total 20 players
and they have retained four similarly if
i scroll down let me talk about let's
say punjab kings they have
pegged 23 players from the auction and
retained two players from
the team last year
talking about
rcb or all challenges bangalore they
have picked 19 players from the auction
and they have retained
three players
all right
now in the next cell of code
we are going to display the players in
each team
based on the different types of players
so let me just run it and show you the
result
so here i am using the same condition
the value shouldn't be equal to
unsold
and i'm going to use another parameter
called hue for the different colors so
here i have used hue
as type because i want to
show the players in each team based on
the different
types
again i have given my
title to the bar plot
and then i have the x label the y label
and my rotation is 50 degrees now
if i scroll down you can see the
different
types of players here is the legend so
blue is for buller
orange or yellow
it's for all rounder green is for batter
and red
which also looks like maroon is for
wicket keepers
and on the
x-axis you can see the different team
names
all right
now let's answer another
couple of questions so here i have
what is the highest amount spent on a
single player by each team
so to solve this question i'll say
my data frame name that is ipl
then i'm going to
say retention
equal to equal to
this should be from auction because you
want to see the highest amount spent and
not
from the retained players
then i'm going to
group
by
i'll say
team
and then
i'll say
cost
in
let me just copy it from here
cost in rupees that is in crores
and
i'll say
max
colon
-1
dot
sort underscore
values
i'll say ascending
equal to false which means i want the
sorted
result in descending order
okay
let me just
bring this to the left side and we'll
run it
there seems to be some error let me
check the error it sees
there's a spelling mistake this should
be
team
let me run it again there you go
so you can see
mumbai indians
have spent
15.25 crores
for one of the players and
this player happens to be shan kissin
then
chennai super kings have spent the
highest amount for
a player who happens to be a bowler the
name is deepak chahar they have bought
him for 14 crores kolkata knight riders
bought
shreya's air for 12.25 crores
and so on and so forth
so these are the highest amounts spent
on a single player by each of the teams
let me scroll down
now we are going to see the player
retained at
maximum value or maximum price
now if you follow ipl
the maximum
price
at which a player was retained happens
to be ravindra jadeja
so let's see at what price was he
retained
i'll say
retention
equal to equal to
i'll say
retained
then i'll say
sort underscore
values
by equal to
i'll use the
same column
cost in
rupees
that's in crores
i'll say
ascending equal to
false
dot
head
and i want to find the top player
again there's some error
let's see
where is the error
she's ascending equal to false
dot head
okay this should be
sort underscore
values
within bracket i should say
buy
i think this should be
fine now let's run it
there you go
so you can see here our result is player
name ravindra jadeja who was retained
for 16 crores by chennai super kings
cool
now the next cell of code will
display or print the top five bowlers
who have been picked in this year's ipl
based on
their cost in inr
let me just run it and show you the
result
you can see here deepak chahar went for
14 crores then we have shradler who was
bought by
delhi capitals earlier he was part of
csk
for 10.75 crores then we have prasada
krishna who has been bought by rajasthan
royals this time
last year he was with keker and he has
been bought for 10 crore similarly
lockheed ferguson has been bought by
gujarat titans
and he played for kkr last season he has
been bought for 10 crores while his base
price was too close then we have avish
khan
you can see avishkhan's base price was
just 20 lakhs and he has been bought for
10 crores by lucknow super giants again
and last year he was part of the daily
capitals
now you can replace
this value
suppose let's say you want to find the
top five batsman's picked or batters
picked with the highest amount you can
just see
batter instead of bowler and if i run
this
you can see here
sirius ayer was bought by
kolkata nitriders for 12.25 crores last
year he was part of delhi capitals
then you have
shrimran hitmayo who's from
west indies he has been
picked by the rajasthan royals for
five crores then we have rahul tripati
shikha dhaban and
particle
now if you wanted to check for
let's say all rounders
you can replace batter with all rounder
if i run this
you can see
lamb living stone has been bought by
punjab kings this season
for
11.5 crores his beast price was just one
crore and last year he was part of the
rajasthan royals
then we have a player from sri lanka
asaranga then we have hershal patel
shahrukh khan and rahul devatia who have
been
the top five all-rounders picked at
highest amount
cool
now finally
we want to
see the players who were part of the ipl
last season but were not picked for this
year's ipl
so for that what i'm doing is first i'm
renaming my
2021 squad column
this column i want to
rename it as previous team
let's run it
then
i am going to find out the unsold
players so here i am saying previous
team not equal to
not participated
and then
i am using another condition team should
be equal to equal to unsold and i'm
going to find out only the player and
the previous team
so let's run it and see the result
so here you can see
these players were part of the ipl last
season but
they haven't been picked this season and
last season they had played for let's
say suresh shrine i played for csk steve
smith was part of the delhi capitals
sakib hussain was part of kkr if i
scroll down you have david milan who
played for punjab kings in 2021
in morgan
who played for kkr he also captained kkr
but unfortunately he was
not picked this season chris lane from
australia also
remained unsold this season
and to thai we have been cutting aditya
there are other players as well
we have kane richardson dhawal kulkarni
cool so these were the players who are
part of the ipl season 2021 but
unfortunately were not picked and
remained unsold for 2022 season
cool
and that brings us to our
end of this demo session on
ipl data analysis 2022 so we learned
how to
use the different functions
and attributes that are part of
the
python libraries and we manipulated the
data we visualized the data and
answered some specific questions
formula one also known as f1 is a
motorsport defined by open wheeled
single seat race cars
it features the best drivers in the most
powerful and technically advanced cars
the sport is governed by the fia that is
international automobile federation here
10 teams comprising of two drivers each
compete in a series of races over a
period of one year to find out the
ultimate driver and a constructor
champion
in our demonstration we'll be using four
data sets let me show them one by one
these are all csv files
now this is the first data set that
we'll be using in our demo so if you
notice the data set does not have
columns
names in fact none of the data sets have
column names so while importing the data
set we will assign the column names
using the names parameter
i'll show that in a
while
now this is the results data set
the results data set has information
about
result id
then we have the race id driver id
we have
the constructor id
grid position
then we also have information about the
fastest
lap then we also have information about
rank
the fastest lap speed
and the status id
now moving on to the second data set
which is about
races
now this is the second data set which is
about races so
it has information about the race id
the year in which the race was held then
we have
the round number circuit id
then the name of the grand prix so you
can see here australia and malaysia and
chinese spanish monaco turkish british
german
and others
then we have the
date on which the gp was held or the
gone pre was
held
we have the time
and a url which basically leads to the
wikipedia page of that particular
grand prix for that year
now moving on to our third data set so
this is our third data set which is
about
drivers
now it has the driver id the name of the
driver you can see here hamilton rosberg
alonso
ryken
then we have sato
masa
button weber and all
after that we have the
number code
then we have the
phone name of the driver the surname of
the driver
and then we have the date of birth of
that particular driver we have the
nationality as well
we have the wikipedia page
for the
driver
now moving on to the last data set which
is about
constructors
so this is the fourth and the final data
set that we'll be using in our data
analysis project
so here we have the constructor id
then the constructor reference
in formula one
and this is the actual name of the
constructor so we have mclaren
we have
bmw sauber williams then we have ferrari
toyota red bull force india
we also have jordan jaguar and all
next we have the
nationality and the url
that is the wikipedia page of
that particular constructor
now let's head over to our jupyter
notebook and we'll start with our
analysis
here is my jupyter notebook that i'll be
using for this demo you can see some of
the cells are already filled this is
just to make sure we
save some time
so using these data sets that we just
saw and our libraries such as numpy
pandas matplotlib and c
we'll answer specific questions such as
the drivers and constructors who have
been the most successful throughout the
history of f1 sport
then we'll explore the impact of
starting and finishing positions and if
the speed of the cars has changed over
the years
so let's begin with our analysis
first and foremost we are going to
import all the necessary libraries so
here i am importing numpy pandas
matplotlib and cbon
and after that i am writing percentage
matplotlib inline
that is to ensure that
all the plots are embedded in line i'll
hit shift enter to run it
take some time there you go so we have
successfully imported all the libraries
now the next step is to
load the data and assign
column names
so
i'll load my
first data which is results i'll say pd
dot
read underscore
csv
i'll give my
file name which is results dot
csv
and then using the
names parameter
i'll pass in the
column names so actually i have written
the column names in a notepad let me
open that
so i have this f1
notepad created which has the column
names i will just start copying
the column names
within the names parameter i'll paste it
if i scroll to the right you can see the
different column names that
have been assigned
and
that
i'm going to say
comma
and i'll write
header equal to none
i'll close the bracket
cool
similarly let's
import the second data set which is
about
races i'll say
pd dot
read underscore csv
i'll give my
file name which is racist.csv
and then
i'll give the
names parameter this is actually names
and not name
okay
i'm going to
copy the
second line
and i'll paste it here
and again
i'll say
header
equal to
none
next
we'll import our third data set which is
about
drivers
so i'll say pd dot read underscore csv
i'll say
drivos.csv
then
again use the
names parameter
and i'll copy the
third line now which has the column
names
for the
drivers data set
here
i
need to give
another parameter which is
header
equal to
none
finally we are going to import
our constructors data set
it's a constructors equal to pd dot
read underscore csv which is the
function present in the pandas library
i'll say
constructors dot csv which is my
file name
and then again i'll use the
names
parameter
i'll go to my notepad and this time i'll
copy the
fourth line which has the column names
for the constructors data set
i'll paste it
and
here i'll give my
final parameter that is header equal to
none
all right
now
let me hit shift enter to
run it
okay we see some error here let's debug
the error it says no such file or
directory drivers dot csv
let's see
where was the issue
this should be
driver.csv
cool now we have successfully loaded the
data and assigned the
columns to the various datasets
now the
next
analysis
is to merge all the data set
so here i'll create a data frame called
df and i'll use
pd dot
merge function
first i'll use the
results data frame that we just
imported above
this one
and
i'm going to merge it with
races data frame
and from the resist data frame i am
going to take
specific columns like the
race id
then
i need the
year
after that i need
name
next
i'm going to take
the round column as well
and
i'm going to use
on parameter so
on parameter
is actually
the column that is common to both the
data frames that is results and recess
so here my common column
is going to be the race id because it is
present in both the data sets
and i would like to merge
so for that i'm going to use how so i am
going to use a left join
so
if you know sql you will be aware of
left join it takes all the rows from the
left table and only the matching rows
from the right table
again going to use the merge function so
i'll write
df equal to pd dot
merge
i'll say df comma and now i'm going to
merge the
ivor's data set
and
i'm going to select specific columns so
i'll say
driver id
make sure there are no spelling mistakes
in the
column names
then i'll say
driver
ref which is the name of the driver or
reference
comma
and then i want the
nationality of the
driver
all right
we'll give a comma i'll say on
which column i want to merge so here the
common column
is going to be the driver id
again
how is going to be a left join
into the final
merge part i'll say again df equal to pd
dot merge
i'll pass in my data frame and my final
data set which i have is about
constructors
from constructors we are going to choose
specific columns so i'll take the
constructor
id
then
i'll take
the name column
and again the
nationality column of the
manufacturer
okay
here i'll say
on
equal to
the common column i'll use
constructor id
give a comma and say how
equal to
left again
cool
make sure
you're merging it with the
right column names so let's run this
cell to merge
all the four data sets
i'll hit
click enter
oops there is some error let's see it
says constructor
id index
okay there's a spelling mistake this
should be
constructor id cool
let's run it
there you go
now
the next thing we want to do is to drop
the unnecessary columns
so i'll say df dot
drop
within the drop function
we are going to pass in the
column names i'll say
number
then we also don't want the
position column
next we have
position underscore
text
after that we have
labs
next we are going to drop
fastest
lap
then we will also drop the
status id
comma
we'll drop the
result underscore id column
then
going to drop the race underscore id
column
we'll also drop
driver underscore id column
and finally we are going to drop
the
constructor underscore id column
and
i'll say access equal to
1
and in place i'll c equal to true
because i want to remove it from my
original data frame that is df
there you go
now the next
thing i want to do is i want to rename
some of the columns so i'll say df dot
rename
i'll say
columns equal to
now we are going to pass in a dictionary
i'm going to change the
rank
to
test
underscore lab underscore rank
let me give a comma
now i'll say
name underscore x
equal to
i'll say
the
grand prix name so i'll say gp
underscore name
next column i'm going to focus is
the nationality column so i'll say
nationality underscore
x
i'll give a colon the value i'm going to
pass in is
driver nationality
all right
up next
we have one column called
underscore
y
and that i am going to change it to
constructor name
another comma
i want to say
nationality
underscore
y
colon
change it to
constructor nationality
underscore nationality
finally we have
driver
underscore ref column
and that i am going to replace with
just
driver
finally i'll say
in place
equal to
true
well
just verify if all the column names are
correct
let's run it
all right so now we have
successfully renamed
the columns
after that
in the next cell i am going to rearrange
the columns so here i am
using the same data frame and we have
just renamed the columns so starting
with your
grand prix name round driver
nationality
and others
let's run this
up next
we're going to drop the
2019 season data because
it is incomplete
so i'll say df equal to
df
then i'll say
here
not
equal to
2090
let's see how to
sort the values so i'll say df equal to
df dot sort underscore values which is
the function name
i am going to sort it by
here
followed by
round
followed by
the
position
underscore
order comma i'll say
ascending
equal to
first let's say is false
next i have true
and then
i'll have true
all right
moving ahead
now we are going to see how to replace
the
put slash
n values in
the time column with
something called nan because the time
column was not registered when a driver
did not finish a race or was lagged by
another driver
so to do this i am going to say
df dot
time
dot i'm going to use the replace
function
and here i'll say
forward slash
or backward slash
n
and i'm going to replace with
numpies nan
i'll say
in place equal to true
let me just copy this because we are
going to use the same
emitters
next i'm going to replace the
milliseconds value
milliseconds dot
replace i'll paste it here
then i'll say df dot
fastest
underscore lab underscore
rank dot
replace
paste it
next i have
df.fastest.lab
dot
time
theory please
to that i have
the next column which is
speed so i'll say fastest
underscore
lap underscore
speed dot
replace
and paste it
so here
i'm going to replace
this particular value
the
backward slash
n with
nan
let me run it
cool
step i'm going to
change the data types for
fastest underscore lab underscore speed
to float then fastest underscore lab
underscore rank to float again
now
problem here is we cannot convert it
into an integer because there are
missing values so we are going to change
it to float
again for milliseconds also we are
changing it to float values
let me run it
now
i'll reset the index
let me show you how to reset the index
i'll say df dot
reset
underscore
index
i'll say
drop
equal to
true
give a comma and say
in place equal to true
all right
that we have
done our initial
processing step of the data set
now we'll check the shape of the data
set then we see all the data sets the
total number of non-null values the
memory usage and we'll
check the head of the data set
now to see the total number of
rows and columns i'll say print df dot
shape
you can see here there are total 24
197 rows in my data set and there are
total of 15 columns
now let's use df dot
info function
so it gives me the
year the grand prix name
the round number
driver constructor name grid
position order total number of points
time
then time in milliseconds the fastest
lap rank
the fastest lap speed
the nationality of the driver the
nationality of the constructor then here
we have the
total number of non-null objects
and then you also have the memory usage
at the bottom
finally let's see the
head of the data frame so i'll see df
dot
head let's say i want to check the first
10 rows
the yuko
if i scroll down you can see here we
have the top 10 rows printed
and you have the year the grand prix
name round driver constructor name and
other columns now let me just
brief you about what these column names
stand for
so the year column that you see here is
this season that the grand prix took
place and then we have the
name of the grand prix
now the round column is the number of
the race in each season for example one
means it was the first race of the
season and then two means it was the
second race of the season so so on and
so forth
then we have the name of the driver
that we have the
name of the car constructor so you can
see ferrari mercedes red bull renault
then we have the grid that is the
starting position before the race
actually this depends on the
qualifications which occur one day
before the race
then we have the position underscore
order column this means the final
position at the end of the race
then we have the points column that is
the total number of points scored in the
race
next we have the time that is the amount
of time that took to finish the race
only the winners time is displayed and
drivers behind the winner are shown how
far behind the winner they are
then we have the milliseconds column
that is the amount of time that took to
finish the race in milliseconds
if i just scroll down
i'll just move to the
right
go to the top
then we have the fastest underscore lab
underscore rank that is the order of the
fastest lab during a race next we have
fastest lap time that is the shortest
amount of time that took to complete a
lap in the release
then we have the lap speed that is the
average speed of the
fastest lap then we have the
country to which the driver belongs to
and then we have the
constructor nationality that is the
country where the car constructor is
based out of
okay
now here i'm going to
set my figure size to 10 comma 6 this is
going to be for all the
plots that we are going to create
afterwards
cool
we'll create a data frame that will have
all the grand prix winners
so here i'm going to say
driver
underscore
winner equal to
use my data frame
df dot i'll say loc
then i'll say
df
i want
the position underscore
order
and that should be equal to 1 so which
means
the driver
1 degrees
and then
i'm going to use the
group by function
i'm going to group it by
driver
and
for values i'll say
position underscore
order
use the
count function
followed by
sort underscore
values i'll say
ascending equal to
false
change it to
to underscore
frame
dot
reset
underscore
index
what essentially i am doing here is i am
finding out
all the drivers that have participated
and
won a grand prix
next
i am going to create a
bar plot so this is going to be the
first visualization of our analysis
so i'll say
sb
which we have taken in our
analysis ideally it should be sns but sb
also will work
so i'll say sb
dot
bar plot
i'm going to say data equal to
driver underscore
winner
the y-axis i'll have
driver
in the x-axis i'll
have position
underscore
order
then i have
color equal to
green
that i'll set my
alpha value
to
0.5
or let's say
0.8
then
we are going to
give a title to our plot so i'll say plt
dot
title
let's say most
grand prix
winners in f1
then we are going to label our access so
for y label i will have
driver
name
we have
the x label
that will have
number of
grand prix wins
and i'll say plt dot
y
text
cool
let's run it
and you can see we have our first
bar plot here now the bar plot
shows that there are
a large distribution of
grand prix events
only a few drivers in history
of f1 have won over 20 grand prairie in
their careers and there are some drivers
who completely dominated the f1 racing
and have won over
50 grand priest in their careers so we
are going to focus on those
top five or top 10
drivers
in the next section so what i'm doing
here is
from the
above
result that we just got i'm going to
filter out only the
top 10 so i'm going to use the head
function
and inside that i passed in 10 if i
print it
you can see here
as per the data that we have
we have michael schumacher who
is the
position order leader with 91 gp events
then we have hamilton vettel prost sena
alonso
then we have stevert clerk and lauda
the data that we have is
not the most recent one so if you check
the actual stats hamilton has actually
overtaken michael schumacher and has
won over
103 close to 103 reeses as of now
and next we have michael somacker so
this is not the most recent data
cool
now using this data we'll create another
bar plot for the top 10
drivers so i'll say sb dot
bar plot
i'll say data equal to
the
name that we have used that is top 10
drivers so i'll say top 10
drivers
in the y axis we'll have
the
driver name
in the x axis we'll have
position
underscore
order
for the bars i'm going to use a color
equal to
let's say blue this time
i'll set my alpha value
to be
0.8
and
i'll say let's say
line
width
equal to
0.8
and i'll also give
an edge color of let's say
black
follow the same drill i'm going to give
a title to my plot so i'll say plt dot
title
most
gp
winners in a phone
will give a y label
that says
driver
name
and then i'll have
x label which will have
number of
on pre
bins
cool let me see if everything is fine
and then we'll
run this there you go
you can see we have a very nice
horizontal
bar plot that shows the
top drivers in f1 so as per our data
that we have we have michael schumacher
who has won over 91 or close to
91
races then we have hamilton vettel
alonso clark and others
all right
in the same way we are going to create
bar plot for the top constructors that
have participated in f1
so here i'm finding out
all the
constructor winners so here
i'm using my position underscore order
equal to equal to 1 and then i'm using
the group by
based on the constructor name
and then i'm finding the count of
position order and sorting the values
in
descending order and i'm changing it to
frame or to a data frame
and to create my bar plot i'm using the
bar plot function the data which is
constructor underscore winner
in the y-axis i'll have the constructor
name on the axis i'll have the position
order
so you can see here i've used color as
pink and i've given a title x label by
label
and white text
let's run it
there you go so here you can see again
the data is
widely
spread
so we have a lot of constructor names
now
our next task is to
check the
top 10 gpa constructor windows so here
i'm using the head function and finding
out the top 10 if i run it
you can see here
the manufacturing companies or the
constructors who have won the most
number of races
are ferrari
mclaren williams then we have mercedes
red bull tim lotus renault
and others
okay
now we'll convert this data into a
horizontal
bar graph or a bar chart
so that will show the bar plot for the
top 10
constructors
now let me show you how to do it
so i'll say
sb which is for c bond dot
bar plot
i'm going to say data equal to
top 10 let me just confirm
the name we have top 10 constructors
scroll down i'll say constructors
y-axis i'll have
constructor
on the x axis i'll have
position underscore order
then
i'll say
color
equal to let's say we'll use the
red color for the bars
then i'll set my
alpha to
0.8
i'll say
line width equal to
0.8
and my
edge
color i'll say
black
that i'll say plt dot
title
say
top 10
most
gp
wins
lt dot
by label would be
constructor
name
and i'll have plt dot
x label
as
number of
gp
wins
cool
let's run it
there you go so here you can see we have
ferrari at the top then we have mclaren
williams more cities i'm pretty certain
by
the end of 2021 season mercedes would
have gained a lot of wins
since hamilton
has been on the top
for mercedes for quite some time now
all right
now
finally we are going to
create a
regression plot that will
show how
two variables that is the starting
position and finishing position
vary
so to do that i am going to exclude the
data points with grid 0 because it skews
the data so 0 means that the driver
started from the
bit lane
so i'm using this function called reg
plot
to plot my
regression line
let me run it and show you the result
there you go
so if you see here
we can easily see there's a linear
relationship between the
starting and
finishing position so on the x-axis we
have the starting position on the y-axis
we have the
finishing or the finish place so which
is what is actually expected right
now we can also see that
most races had up to
25 drivers you can see the density of
the points here
but some of the recess also had over 30
drivers you can see the
light color blue dots
next
we are going to
check whether the speed of the cars
changed over the years since this data
is only available from 2004 onwards so
we have
we have taken
years that start from 2004 onwards
now let me show you the result
of this data
so essentially we are plotting the
average speed among
all teams during the fastest lap at
individual grand prix
and here on the
y axis you have the average fastest
speed in kilometer per hour and then you
have the different
gps
and you can see here the year values
now
in general what we see is there's a
decrease in the average fastest lap from
2004
till around
2015
for almost all the circuits
and again from 2015 onward the speed
started
to increase
you can see here there's an increase
after 2015 there's an increase there's
an increase here as well
you can also notice that
the speed is very different on each
track for instance if you check the
italian grand prix which is here
italian gp has the
fastest race in the calendar with
average speed exceeding over
240 kilometers per hour on the other
hand if you
talk about the
monaco grand prix let me show you if you
see here
the monaco gp is the slowest race with
average speed below
160 kilometer per hour now this is
actually expected because the monaco
grand prix
has very narrow streets and
hence the drivers cannot
drive fast in this circuit
all right
so
so now we are going to look at
healthcare market forecast
so as for
markets and markets.com
the healthcare analytics market is
projected to reach 75.1 billion us
dollars by 2026 from 21.1 billion us
dollars in 2021.
now talking about
india
statista.com
india's healthcare sector was about 160
billion u.s dollars in 2017
it was estimated to reach up to 372
billion us dollars by 2022.
as per rbc capital markets approximately
30 percent of the world's data is
generated by the healthcare industry
by 2025 the compound annual growth rate
of data in healthcare will reach 36
percent now that is six percent faster
than manufacturing ten percent faster
than financial services and eleven
percent faster than media and
entertainment
now let's see the various applications
and issues that analytics can solve in
healthcare
we will look at drug discovery staffing
and operation
and see how analytics can help predict
diseases
so talking about
drug discovery
now the drug discovery is a very long
process sometimes it takes about 12
years and costs way too much about 2.6
billion us dollars
now data analytics can increase the drug
delivery process rate in medical science
helping to gain faster approval from the
food and drug administration
it can help optimize and improve the
efficiency of clinical trials
another key development that has
happened in a number of pharmaceutical
companies like astrazeneca bayer
cleansing
and jensen research and development has
recently announced a data sharing
initiative called project data sphere
these companies have agreed to share
historical cancer research data to help
researchers in the fight against the
disease today
the database will be available online
globally and the analytics technology
would be provided by software vendor sas
now moving on
we have
staffing and operation
now this is another crucial problem that
every staff manager in hospital faces
that is the problem of staff allocations
at a given period
understanding how many people a manager
should put on a staff at any given time
period can be very challenging
if you put too many workers the risk of
having unnecessary labor costs go up
too few workers you can have poor
customer service outcomes
which can be fatal for patients
so business analysts can use data to
forecast patient admission trends at
specific times of the day and provide
insights to the staff managers to assign
the right number of staff during peak
and slow periods
next we'll talk about
predicting diseases
so business analytics can also predict
trends in the spread of illness allowing
doctors hospitals medical staff and
individuals to adequately prepare
themselves
for example in the case of coronavirus
analyzing data to predict future spikes
in cases can help hospitals ensure the
staff have enough protective equipment
and patient beds
using medical imaging and algorithms
physicians can detect diabetic
retinopathy which is a condition that
damages the eye due to diabetes and
algorithms can also help detect cancer
cells in a patient
detecting cancer at an early stage has
been a focus area in healthcare for
quite some time now
the cancer moonshot initiative by former
u.s president barack obama initiated in
his second term relies on advanced
analytical techniques to pace up the
discovery of cancer cures by identifying
the trends and treatments used worldwide
that have the highest success rate
now
let's look at the hand washing case
study in
detail so to give you some context
before the
mid 19th century
the science of bacteria was not
discovered yet
nobody knew that microorganisms could
spread diseases back then even hospital
staff did not follow basic hygiene
practices
not even doctors cared to wash their
hands
now to be honest we all realized the
importance of hand washing after the
world was hit by coronavirus pandemic
now meet
dr
ignaz simelweis
he was a hungarian-born doctor and
practiced at the vienna general
hospital's maternity clinic between 1846
and 1849
dr simelweis is regarded as the father
of infection control for discovering the
medical benefits of hand washing
dr simelweis was very disturbed by the
increasing fatality rate of mothers from
childbed fever at vienna hospital so
child bed fever is also known as
pure plural fever
it happens due to infections in the
female reproductive tract following
child birth
this child fever was an issue of concern
throughout europe with some hospitals
having over 40 percent mortality rate so
out of every 100 mothers who used to
give birth at least 40 mothers would die
in a week or two weeks time
so the demo case study i am going to
present now concerns the work of dr
ignac symbol wise in reducing the risk
of childbirth fever during childbirth in
vienna hospital during the mid 19th
century so he collected and analyzed
historical data on debts in his clinic
and established a theory
of what was contributing to increasing
deaths of mothers
now to solve a problem business analysts
would often need to collect data from
multiple sources for this demo we'll be
using three data sets that are publicly
accessible on kegel and github let me
go ahead and show you the three data
sets first
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free
visit scale up by simply learn click on
the link in the description to know more
okay so this is the first data set that
i have which is called the yearly fever
mortality data set so here you can see
the first column is about year it starts
from
1784
and it goes till
1846
the next column we have is about the
total number of births that took place
at the vienna general hospital maternity
clinic and then we have the total number
of deaths reported from child bed fever
next
then we have the
fever mortality per clinic so
in the vienna hospital
there were two separate clinics that
operated between
1833 and 1846
birth one
column represents the total number of
births that took place
in clinic one
similarly
that's one column represents the total
number of deaths that took place in
clinic 1 of the
maternity clinic at vienna general
hospital births 2 and that's 2
has the information about the births and
deaths that happened in clinic 2.
then we have the
final data set
this data set is about
monthly debts which starts from
january
1841
till
march 1849
we have the total number of births and
the total number of deaths and this
monthly underscored deaths is only for
clinic one
we'll learn in detail about clinic one
and clinic 2 at the maternity hospital
and what they represent in detail
all right
ok
so
this is my jupyter notebook which has
the
lines of code already written i am going
to
explain you each cell of code and will
explore
the hand washing case study by looking
at the outputs for each of the cells
let's start with the first cell so here
i'm going to import my first data set
which is the
yearly fever
mortality
this is a csv data set
and to
load the data set i'm using the pandas
library and the read underscore csp
function
i am using
parse underscore
dates equal to
year so this
parse underscore dates will format the
year column in the form of a date value
next
i have
set
my index to be the year column you can
see here set underscore index equal to
year and i am mentioning that in place
equal to true which means that the
original data is now modified and
updated in place
and i'm importing the data
and storing it in a variable called
yearly underscore that's
next i'm going to print my
data set
let me just
hit shift enter
we can see the result
there is an error here it says
okay this should be yearly underscore
deaths
let me run it again
there you go
so here you can see we have set the year
column as our index
you can see the year column is our index
then we have the
other two columns the total number of
births and the total number of deaths
starting from
1784
till 1846
all right
now
you can see
the values for year total births and the
total number of deaths from 1784 till
1846 in the maternity clinic of vienna
hospital where similvoice used to
practice
coming to the
next cell of code
here
we are going to calculate the
mortality rate or the mortality
percentage
for that i'm going to create
a new column called as
mortality
so here i'm mentioning my data frame
which is yearly underscore deaths that
we created above and then within square
brackets i am passing in
my new column name which is mortality
and the
formula to calculate mortality is
total
deaths
divided by
the total number of births into hundred
now let's print the result
you can see here we have added a new
column called mortality and it has given
us the
mortality rate
for each of the years starting from 1784
till 1846
now next
we are
going to find out some descriptive
statistics using the describe function
so i have used yearly underscore deaths
dot describe
if i run it you can see the
count that is the total number of rows
that are there in our
data set
then we have the
mean birth so the
average birth
that has taken place in all these years
per year is around 2268.
the total debts reported in each of the
years that is the average number of
deaths is around 93 and the mortality is
around three percent or 3.3 percent we
have the standard deviation
we have the
minimum value that is the
least births that took place in one of
the years was
284 and the maximum is 4010
then we have the 25th percentile the
50th percentile and the 75th percentile
we are going to create our first plot
that is
taught about yearly mortality rate each
year between
1784 till 1846
now here we are going to create a line
plot and for that
i'm going to import my matplotlib dot pi
plot as plt
i'm setting my figure size to be 14
comma 5
and using the plot function i am going
to create my line plot
i have given my
data value as mortality rate
i am going to use
color as green and marker as
o so o will represent as dots and after
that i am going to give a title as
mortality from child bed fever during
child birth i have given a x label as
year and y label as mortality rate
let's run and see the output
there you go
if i scroll down
you can see here we have a nice
line chart
now we can notice that the modality rate
started increasing somewhere around
1823 from here you can see a spike
and gradually the
mortality rate or fatality rate from
childbed fever started increasing from
around 1820
the reason was you can see here there
was a sharp increase after
1823
so the reason
was
around 1823
cimilweis clinic started giving lessons
on
pathological anatomy
so
pathology i guess you would know is the
branch of medicine that deals with the
study of
causes and effects of diseases
so doctors would take classes on the
corpses organs and tissues to learn the
reasons for the cause of the death
so after the post mortems then they
might deliver a baby or examine a
patient
possibly with pieces of contaminated
flesh remaining in their hands
so similar wise suspected that this
could be the reason for childbed fever
he continued with his analysis and
looked for further evidence to support
his hypothesis
not till
1832 there was only one maternity clinic
at the vienna hospital
now that had become very overcrowded so
an extension was built and two clinics
were created in
1833 you can see it here
now until
1840 both clinics were used for teaching
and training medical students and
midwives
so midwives are people who help mothers
deliver babies and take care of newborns
after childbirth
so after 1840 the physicians
that included doctors and medical
students used to operate in clinic one
and only midwives used to operate in
clinic two after eighteen forty
so similwise spotted that in clinic one
the fatality rate for mothers from
childbed fever was three times more than
those who delivered in clinic two
so you can see here in clinic one which
was the doctor's word
and for people
who
were given trainings the mortality rate
was ten percent while in clinic two
where only the midwives operated the
mortality rate was three percent
so he again believed that in clinic one
where doctors and physicians operated
they also used to handle corpses during
autopsies before operating on pregnant
women
and they never used to wash their hands
between the two jobs
but midwives in clinic 2 never went to
the autopsy room so similar spotted that
there were links between the lack of
hygiene of the doctors and the mortality
rate of the mothers
so let's analyze that data now
cool
so i am going to import my second data
set which has the information about
births and deaths in clinic one and
clinic two so here i'm importing my csv
data set and i'm storing it
in a data frame name called clinics
again i've used
parse underscore dates as year to format
the
date values i've given my
file location followed by the
file name
and dot the extension of the file which
is csv file
again i have set my index to be the year
column
and i'm printing the head of the data
frame now let me hit shift enter
okay so here you can see
1833 onwards
birth one death one that is for clinic
one then we have births two that's two
for clinic two
next
we are going to calculate the mortality
for both the clinics that is clinic one
and clinic two so what i'm doing here is
i'm creating
two columns mortality one and mortality
two so mortality one is for clinic one
then mortality two is for clinic two
again the formula is the same deaths
divided by births into 100 is the
mortality rate
let me run it
and now we are going to see the
first 10 rows from our newly created
data frame you can see here we have
added
two more columns mortality one and
mortality two
and these are the results
now if you notice
see the mortality rate
for the clinic one where
dr semelweis used to practice
or the physicians who also operated on
the
dead bodies
used to practice so the mortality rate
is high there
now let's
compare
and visualize the mortality rate
at both the clinics so here i'm again
setting my figure size to be 14 comma 5
i've used
clinics
dot index mortality one i've given a
label as clinic one
color i'm using as steel marker is
o
so this o will make sure for each of the
years we have a
dot or
a round shape
similarly for clinic 2 we have mortality
2 i'm using
blue color again marker as o
then i'm giving a legend
a title called mortality from childbed
fever during childbirth i also have a
while label called mortality rate
let's run it
now if i scroll down you can see
the mortality rate
from
1833 onwards till 1846 for both the
clinics
the teal color represents clinic one and
the blue color represents clinic two
so from this graph we can see that the
death rate at clinic 1 was significantly
higher after
1840 you can see there has
a huge spike
compared to clinic 2 where only the
midwives practiced and they never
operated on the dead bodies in the
autopsy room
so now doctor simul vice had strong
evidence to believe that the doctors
were transmitting infectious flesh or
you can say material substances from
previous operations to mothers through
their hands and this was leading to
childbirth fever
so far
we have seen in our analysis till
eighteen hundred and forty six
and dr semelweis in mid
1847 asked his colleagues and fellow
physicians at maternity clinic one to
wash their hands with chlorinated lyme
solution before attending pregnant
mothers and the results were significant
so let's see the final analysis of
clinic one where doctor symbol wise
practiced and how he was able to reduce
the mortality rate
now i am going to load the monthly
deaths data set that has information
from january 1841 till march 1849
and after 1849 his contract was
terminated and he was asked to leave the
vienna hospital i'll tell you why he was
asked to leave
a little later
let's load the final data set now
okay so
i'm going to import my final data set
which is the monthly underscore debts
dot csv i'm storing it
in a variable called monthly underscore
data let me run it
so here you can see
the
data for
all the months starting from
january 1841 till march 1849
next
i'm going to find the monthly
mortality at clinic one
so
i'm going to divide the
deaths divided by birds into 100
so here you can see we have created new
column called proportional underscore
deaths
that has the
death rate for each of the months
now the doctors in clinic one started
washing their hands in june
1847 before carrying out delivery
operations
so
we have
divided original data into two data
frames called
before washing and
then we have after washing
we will set the start of hand washing
date to
1st of june 1847
you can see here i have said
start of hand washing pandas dot 2 data
frame i am giving my
hand washing start date that is 1st of
june 1847.
or washing data frame will have all the
values that lie prior to june
1847 so here i have subset my data i'm
saying
date should be less than
a date which is 1st of june
1847 and after washing should be
greater than equal to 1st of june 1847.
we run this
i'll print my before
washing data frame you can see
it has taken all the values till
may 1847
and for after washing we have all the
values starting from june 1847 till we
have
march 1849
so we have split
months data into before and after hand
washing start date
now let's
plot our final
graph that shows the difference in the
modality rate of mothers
before and after hand washing
so here
i am setting ax which is the axis
before washing
dot plot will create a line plot i am
saying x to be date y to be proportional
deaths i'm giving my label to be
beforehand washing i'm using color
as c which is for c n
then here b represents blue
this is for after hand washing again x
should be date y should be proportional
underscore deaths
here i'm using a line style to be dotted
lines to just
you know compare the plots
i've set my while label to be proportion
that's let's run it
and you can see the
result
let me scroll down
there you go on the x-axis we have the
date on the y-axis we have the
proportion depth
the
cyan color represents before hand
washing that is the solid line and we
have the dotted lines for
after hand washing
now you can see how
starting from the summer of
1847
the proportion of deaths got reduced
significantly less than five percent you
can see here
so this was when civil wise made hand
washing
mandatory
now
we'll calculate the difference in
average monthly percentage debts before
and after hand washing so what i'm doing
is i'm creating
two variables before proportion and
after proportion
then we are going to subtract
before proportion mean minus the after
proportion mean if you see the
difference you can see here it is eight
point three percent so from
ten percent we just
reduced it to less than three percent
so this was all about the
hand washing case study that simulwise
had conducted using different data sets
so we perform this explorative data
analysis using three data sets
and you explored how using pandas and
matplotlib you can create
different charts and analyze data
yearly data
or time series data
the sad part is that with all this
exploratory analysis and the findings dr
simelweis made his superiors at vena
hospital refused to
accept his theory and he was met with a
lot of criticism
medical community rejected his discovery
in march 1849 and he was forced to leave
the vienna general hospital
one reason we can argue as business
analyst is that
statistical analysis and data
visualization were very uncommon those
days in the field of medical science
simulwise only published his data as
long tables of raw data but he couldn't
show any graphs or confidence intervals
to support his hypothesis
his ideas were considered as offense to
the medical community he hurt them
since similar wise meant that doctors
were the cause of increased deaths he
believed in another theory called
meismus which basically means some bad
component in the air was the cause of
childbed fever deaths
after
two decades
when
joseph lister and luis pasture produced
more evidence of the germ theory and
antiseptic techniques only then the
value of hand washing was appreciated
but nevertheless his work was based on
evidence supported by numbers showing
that simple hand washing by health care
workers could save millions of lives
later he did get some recognition
the budapest university where doctor
ignace simelweis used to teach
after getting terminated from vienna
general hospital is now named as
simulvice university
in january 2019
the statue of dr
semelweis was unveiled at the world
health organization by the current
director general mr trados you can see
on the right on the left we have the
state secretary of the ministry of
foreign affairs and trade
from hungary
on the 100th anniversary of his death
the government of austria issued a
postage stamp in his honor
and in march 2020 after the world was
hit by coronavirus google also
recognized wise
hand washing findings and gave him a
will doodle
that brings us to the end of our
interesting video tutorial on dr
simulvi's hand washing case study using
python i hope it was useful and
informative if you have any queries
