yeah hi everyone coming back again with
the third video covering many diagram
based questions related to ended orders
so going in detail I hope you guys are
very clear about this palette ah ginger
go is most common in the case of your
maxillary lateral incisors okay and this
is what the parotid ginger you can see
the parentage enjoy broach is filled
with in a glass and a MOS image okay
this is what the power to change Al Groh
is and I hope you know the you know that
there are two types of radical as this
one is basis and second one is true
cysts
okay so base is this it provides a bail
okay it provides is a continuation of
the root canal morphology and this is to
open into the root canal morphology
that's the bay providing it way whereas
true cyst is it's nowhere related to the
root canal root canal and it is
completely lined by epithelium so it is
called as no truces so whereas basis it
is not completely lined by epithelium
because at one point it has connection
into the root canal system so that's a
basic difference between the bassist and
truces these are the two types of
radical assist and you can clearly see a
gutta-percha is true today is the sinus
tract opening this is what the cutter
pod seandrade a graph in the sinus tract
opening and as as I have I mean like
explain you clearly that too bad
peridot ginger rules are most commonly
on the maxillary lateral incisors and
you can see there are three types of
peridot ginger grooves that is type 1
and type 2 and type 3 type 1 is a groove
is short but not beyond one third of the
kernel one third of the root whereas
type two is long beyond coronal one
third of the root but it it is shallow
corresponding to a normal or a simple
root canal system whereas type 3 is very
long it's beyond the kernel one third of
the roof deep and corresponding to a
complex root canal system it is a simple
root canal system it's a complex root
canal system so recently they have asked
the question related to type two type of
pathogen gel grew in the recent
assertion papers of end of
so we can we can predator repeat in this
session also so please make a note about
these types next course is the this is
an operation radiograph shockula's you
later graph is most commonly used to
check the palatal abscess and of course
you can clearly see the parallel abscess
in relation to the maxillary anterior
and if you clearly observe this you can
see a parrot or ginger guru here so
maxillary parrot collapses are most
common the maxillary lateral the reason
is because maximum batter is most
commonly associated with the palate a
ginger go which provides an axis for the
organisms to infect it so next course is
this is the thermo fill a type of
operating system where you have in it
alpha phase gutta-percha attached to it
these are different types of for
operating systems this is karma fill
simple field will have apical plug here
and this is Jay's quick fill where which
is connected to end of mode which is
connected to a micro motor like device
okay this is DZ 16 where EG means david
green 16 means the working tip is 16
millimeters and you have this is DZ 16
clear and this is i mean like you can
you can compare the BG 16 to 17 okay so
this is two different times
okay recently they have asked the ins
2018 they have asked the question
related to this bz 16 22 ends they have
different then it is with two numbers
they're different whereas here it is
same both ends are same so by which you
can identify and come up with the right
answer so these are all our anatomic
explorers all these are endodontic
experts which helps in identifying the
carroll orifices as well as helps in
identifying the correct angulation of
the canals this is the molar bar where
you have a long shank and is used for
calcified Karos this is in taxes per
used to prepare axis opening this is jet
bar which is a side cutting bar okay no
end cutting it has a side cutting and
it's used to and large orifice once the
axis is open this is a trans metal bar
which is which is used to break the
crown sore which is used to prepare the
axis opening through the crown this is
end of box where you can keep your files
this is bar sterilizer where you can
keep the bars incidents and keep it in
Auto Club bar sterilizer I hope you are
very good at this this is a electronic
apex locator this is a great intramural
periapical great where you can see the
grid blocks on it each side each each
each grid block is one millimeter one
millimeter in length and one millimeter
in breath this is these are endo brushes
which are all called as Navi tapes which
are used to clean the root canal
swallows your root canal systems
this is endo back once asked in the aims
these are different types of tips that
are available in endo back ok master
master delivery tape and them macro
cannula and the micro cannula which has
multiple vents which is a type of
irrigation irrigation system this is
epic sim I hope we have already
discussed about this on the groom so
this is something like this is an array
this is a moving instrument you can see
a lash here this is a moving instrument
which you can place into the periapical
region through the root canal morphology
and you can stab the system where it is
going to remove all the periodical
system similar see me you can even this
this is how you have to place it in the
root canal so once you start this is all
very epic elation where it can be used
to remove the non-responding periapical
cysts or periapical lesions I hope you
are very good at this this is SAP self
existing file
today's exam we are given this is indo
indo Phoenicia experient of Anisha this
is end of motor you'll have a buyer here
you'll have a wide extending now there
are many coordinate systems available
without wire but regularly they will
have wire and this almost looks like
your micro motor but this is the initial
operate rotary instrument which is
called as an anthro here you have an
opening like similarly like your micro
motor you will have an opening you have
to attach this to the micro motor so
easy way of identifying the anther
Geary's it looks like it micro motor
with an opening at one side but attached
to it not refined whereas your this this
is like you don't have an opening end
here so that's a way how we can
differentiate a hand piece of endo motor
with Anthony I hope you know this light
amplification by stimulated emission of
radiation will form of laser ok these
are very fine right very fine and
refined so these are silver points which
you can appreciate on the radiograph and
they can be introduced only up to 25
number preparation and they can be used
in the case of tortious and fine canals
where the temperature cannot be incident
because gutta-percha will get folded if
you insert it in the narrow canals and
the mode by which the silver consists in
layers by passing them two to three
times or three to four times over the
Bunsen burner flame okay this is a
device where you can see the device so
this is a pulse oximeter a manually made
pulse oximeter and this is a textbook
based diagram they can give because aims
people they have given already this is a
pulse oximeter textbook based picture
and I hope you guys this pulse oximeter
works on beads laughs this is what the
bees life if you want you can go ahead
this is what
lesser deployed flow meter II which
works on the du plus principal means an
echo this is the echo and the photo
detector helps in detecting the echo
this is a textbook based pick off you
ever measured applaud flow meter II
which is other type of another
other non-invasive method of detecting
the pulp vitality particularly the blood
supply okay this is a file retrieval
system we can clearly see this is a
massaman kid if it is kid if it is a man
sermon instrument which helps in remove
the file recently they have given one
question on guide okay rider kid guy
rockets are used to remove the Post
Master man kids all are used to remove
the files this is used to remove the
post this is one more system which helps
in removing the post you can see the
post removal inserted and they are
removing the post and few few important
lines relate base Thomas I hope you know
what is this Thomas miss Thomas can be
identified by methyl and blue meth elbow
is used in many situations where you can
identify the cracks also you can
identify the extra canals also with the
methyl in blue these are different types
of miss Thomas already posted on group
yesterday and aims people they have
already given many questions onto this
please please go ahead read about all
the high type service Thomas this is
meltdowns classification I get an
important area when you are talking
about the seizure of the canals so there
are three types of Melton's categories
and the shisha pecans are most common ii
mandibular molars make a note about this
and make a note about of these three
categories which is again a very
important topic ok the levels of
clinical significance they can ask you
all the levels which stands first which
stands last which study is more
clinically relevant yet they can ask you
the ascending order they can ask you the
descending order please learn about this
this is very important later of
preparation you can see a band here
right you can see a band you know almost
all the things which are used as retro
preparation files which are also called
as you can see here the word kiss
they're called as neck kiss one zero two
zero three zero four zero files which
are used for a retro clip most favorite
question of aims
I hope this flap is already done in the
previous slide please go ahead is the
most commonly used
flap that is used in the aesthetic
purpose of endodontics apical
ramifications and latin ramifications at
three millimeters 98% is of apical and
nine
under the plan telegram applications
anymore I hope you are very good at this
monoblock monoblock concept the main
important aspect is forming a single
block single cohesive on in the primary
motor block you have only one interface
and the examples of hydron MTA bio-data
polyethylene v fiber poster and core
build-up the second one where you will
have two interfaces please learn about
the examples which are damn important
there is sherry you have three
interfaces sorry three interfaces and
regularly ask his active GP and ender s
are the most commonly asked examples we
had today the sharing on a block okay
identify this red red color point to the
red color point is fenestration which is
an isolated one with a marginal bone
impact whereas white one he said a sense
where there is no marginal bone intact
this is the beans modification of
determining working length regularly you
need to go one millimeter short in the
case often a bone resorption you need to
go for 1.5 millimeter shot in the case
of bone as well as to the resorption you
need to go for 2 millimeter short of FX
empty ad again a most common last
question given by Walt Ron and it's a
mixture of mixture of tetracycline
isomer which is the doxycycline and
citric acid and a detergent okay the
detergent that is used here is tweet 88
zero most effectiveness typical is these
are different modifications of EDTA so
please learn about these modifications
already asked question is are separate
parts in reply is a combination of EDD
A+ urea peroxidase please learn about
rest all things just make a note so that
in options you can directly go for that
EDTA see see is 7th also so I feel like
you can easily manage these questions if
you have an idea or a command or what is
this actually if you can have a one day
one time reading I hope you can easily
select the options
okay this is again a method that helps
in determining the extra kennels
accurate access opening ultrasonics as I
said like method lo sham face test which
is used of sodium hypochlorite and other
methods of identifying extra canals so
just go with the slide just one time new
spur this one time reading I feel like
you can manage the things off so this is
pa pa index periodical index which was
given in neat not a names but I want you
guys to make a note P and X 1 is a
normal periodical structure to be
smaller changes 3 is changes in the bone
structure with the minimal mineral loss
and Forests periodontitis with
well-defined radiolucency and 5 is
severe periodontitis with elemental in
indicating for the expansion of the
lesion upon diagram based question you
can just have a look over this these are
the five scoring's of P I index done for
now I'm going to come up with another
video study hard all the best guys
signing off dr. stay
