cortex a72 processor which was released
in june 2019
when utilized with an adequate power
supply the pi 4 can be also be powered
using a usb c connector allowing for
more power to be delivered to downstream
peripherals
raspberry pi 4 can do everything a
desktop computer does including
accessing the internet and watching high

performance over previous generations we
have created a complete desktop
experience for the first time whether
you are editing documents browsing the
web with multiple tab opens wrangling
spreadsheets or creating a presentation
the experience will be smooth and
familiar
multiple usb ports the usb ports on your
raspberry pi 4 has been upgraded in
addition to the two usb connection there
are
two usb 3 ports which can transport data
up to 10 times quicker
quick networking
gigabit ethernet interconnected wireless
networking and bluetooth are included
