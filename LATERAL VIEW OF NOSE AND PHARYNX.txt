hello everyone in this presentation
we'll learn important things regarding
lateral wall of nose and pharynx
starting with the lateral wall of nose
the important things that you have to
keep in mind regarding lateral wall of
nose is the turbinates or the conquer so
they're superior conquer middle conquer
and inferior conquer the superior
conquer is smallest whereas the infidel
conquer is the largest out of all the
three conquer are turbinates these
conquer overlies the Miatas so the space
beneath this conquer is called as me
artists their superior middle and
inferior me artists out of all the
inferior me artists is the largest so
the structures that drains into these me
artists is very important so here you
can see starting with spin or delayed
sinus
so spin oval sinus drains into spino
with model rhesus so spinodal sinus
drains into spino a the model rhesus
whereas the posterior is the modulated
sinuses so ether model sinus is divided
into anterior middle and posterior
portion with model air sinus drains into
superior me artists there as anterior
middle maxillary sinus and frontal sinus
drains into meeting me artists here you
need to understand an important thing
middle meatus is divided in divided into
2 that is the structures that drains
into bulla its modulus and the
structures that drain into I add a semi
linens so bullet models is a rounded
elevation on which only middle is model
a sinus drains into there as hiatus a
millionairess is a semilunar sulcus into
which maxillary sense
anterior it model sinus and frontal
sinus train into whereas the structure
that drains into inferior Miatas is
nasolacrimal duct so naso like lemon
drains into inferior mirrors
so this nasolacrimal duct is guarded by
valve wash has not so it is called
guarded by value of fastener
edie inferior meters so there is
something called as Cecil backs plexus
also called as epistaxis area so it is
the area where it is a common set of
bleeding in the lateral wall of nose so
it is this area is located at anterior
inferior part of the nasal septum and
the arteries that are associated with
Kissel backs plexus are Pinot Palatine
artery anterior it small artery greater
Palatine artery and Sceptile branch of
superior level artery so these are the
arteries that are associated with
epistaxis area are also called as Kissel
bags area or Kissel bags triangle moving
on to Friday s so firings is divided
into three parts the nasal part that is
nasopharynx also called as AP pharynx
which extends from the base of the skull
to soft palate as you can see in the
diagram the oral part that is oropharynx
which extends from hard palate to hyoid
bone the laryngeal part also called as
laryngeal pharynx or hypopharynx which
extends from upper border of epiglottis
to lower border of cricoid cartilage so
the PI reformed fossa which is also
called a Smuggler's pouch or Smuggler's
fossa is located in the laryngeal
fairings this slide shows you the weak
spot between the muzzles of fairings the
main one is Kilian stations so Kilian
stations is the weakest area of pharynx
which is located between public
thoroughfare injures and longitudinal
crike of ranges so the Killians day
cells is present between pyro fairness
and Clicquot fairness whereas there is
another weak spot that is lamers
divisions which is located between
cricopharyngeal and longitudinal muzzle
of esophagus so what is the clinical
significance of these vague spots so if
the muscles that is cricopharyngeal and
thyra fringes doesn't relax what happens
is the food that we eat escapes through
this
area to form an pharyngeal pouch so
Killians Dyson's is important clinically
because it is a weakest area which leads
to the formation of pharyngeal pouch
also called as zingers diverticulum and
the muscles involved are once again it
is Theroux fairness and Clicquot
fairness the structures passing between
the constructors of fairings is also
important here you can see the gaps the
numbers are denoted with the gaps one
two three and four so the first gap is
between the base of the skull and
superior constrictor also called as
sinus of more gagney and these are the
structures passing through this gap one
whereas the gap two is between superior
constrictor and middle constrictor the
gap 3 is between middle and inferior
constrictor whereas the last gap is
between inferior constrictor and
esophagus these are the structures that
are passing between the Constructors
remember middle constrictor is
considered to be a fan-shaped in muzzles
of fairings there is one more term
called passive enriched so passive
enriched is important clinically because
the synergistic effect of passive and
still along with the soft palate makes
the food enter into oropharynx instead
of nasopharynx so passive enriched is
formed with the help of palatov
arrangers so the muscle responsible or
the muscle which forms most of the part
of passive and is palliative arranges
there is some lymphatic chain in the
pharynx which is important that is
denoted as walnuts lymphatic ring so all
days lymphatic ring consists of four
types of tonsils that is fair angel
downs and also called as arena transom
tubal towns in Palatine tonsils and
lingual tonsils
so this is the varlets chain of
lymphatic chain which consists of
or tonsils pharyngeal tubule palate and
and lingual tonsil
