hello everyone and welcome to simply
learns youtube channel today we will be
taking you through express.js
we will go through certain express js
http methods features of express js and
this will increase your enhanced
knowledge of express js
the best way to master a language is by
programming in it
so by the end of this tutorial you will
be able to implement express js in
different ways
before we begin
let me tell you that we have regular
updates on multiple technological videos
so if you are a tech geek in a
continuous hand for the latest
technological trends then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel so without further ado let's get
started and see what's in it for you
first
we will see introduction to express.js
after that we will see what is expressjs
moving ahead we will see features of
express js
after that we will see http request
types
moving ahead we will see what is rest
api and and then some hands-on
demonstration
node.js is a fast javascript runtime
environment but it does not support
request handling function http methods
or serving files so expressjs comes into
the picture
express makes the node.js code easier as
express is written in javascript it is
very easy to understand for the
developers who know javascript and till
now express is the most popular
framework of node.js
js is a lightweight framework which
gives functionality to it and makes
nodejs easy for developers
let's see what express js is
express.js is a node.js framework
designed to build apis web applications
and cross-platform mobile apps
it is very high performance fast
lightweight and unopinionated that is
there is no structural way to write a
code
express.js is used as a server-side
scripting language
now
we will discuss features of express.js
first
fast server side development
with the features of node.js express
saves a lot of time
middleware
middleware is a request handler that has
access to the application request
response cycle
routing
this refers to how an application's
endpoint urls respond to client request
templating it provides templating
engines to build dynamic content on the
web pages by creating html templates on
the server
debugging
express makes it easier as it identifies
the exact part where the bugs are
now we will see the http request types
first one is get
it is used to request data from the
server but mainly this method is used to
read data
second one is patch
it is used to update the data or to
change or replace it
third one is post
this method is used to create new or to
edit already existing data
last one is delete
this method is used to delete the data
completely from the server
now
we will see the complete architecture of
http request types
in this
client sends a request in the form of
json file and with the help of http
request
which are get post delete and patch
then
it will go to the server then server
sends back the response to the client in
the form of message to tell what
happened to your request
now we will see what is rest api
rest means representational state
transfer
rest is a popular architecture which is
used to create web services
and api is a application programming
interface which is a code that allows
two software programs to communicate
with each other
rest api is a software that allow two
applications to communicate with each
other with the help of internet and
various devices it is a standard way to
send and receive data for web services
rest api is very flexible and can handle
multiple types of calls
restful api is a very popular and very
commonly used to create apis for
evaluations
now we have hands-on demonstration on
some basics of express js
so let's get started in this tutorial i
am using vs code but before that let's
create a folder
for that you have to go to your c drive
or wherever you want to create that
folder
let's create new folder
i'm gonna name it as express
js 15
save this file
now
open your visual studio code
open that folder
here as you can see expressjs15
select folder
expressjs15
is opened here let's cut this
now go to the terminal new terminal
and write npm command
npm
turn it
y
this will create a json file for us
as you can see here
now
let's cut this
now
we will install express js for that
we will again go to the terminal
and write
npm
install
express
press enter this will take couple of
seconds to install here we go
our express is installed
now
we'll cut this
all the modules are installed in this
as you can see
let's cut this and create a file here
let's name it as
index.js enter
let's just
close this folder
so
the
index.js has been created
elsewhere
you have to delete it
created
outside this module
so we'll create it
here
not here again
yes
let's write
bonds
app
which requires
express
let's
function
port
the port which we are going to use
let's name it as 4000
let's make it
dot lesson
and the function again
name
to where it will listen to our code
function that we have created error
function
and console.log
running on board
all the same to get the data
port
okay
let's close this
yeah so our
basic
program is completed
now
what i have done here is i have created
a basic express app
now i will write the gate method
so let's get started
app dot get
okay
request
request response
now we'll send the response
sponson
let's
let's write it as
hello
this is
it
this is gate method
close this
save this
now
we will go to the terminal
and
run this file to see whether it is
working or not
so we'll write node dot
to run this file
here we go
server is running on port 4000
now
we'll go to the chrome extension
and we'll write here as
localhost
4000 here we go
it says can't get this is because get
method needs a url which we have
declared here also
so we'll copy this
get request from here and paste it to
this url
press enter
this shows us hello this is gate method
now
we'll go to the post
method let's close this terminal and
write
post method
dot
post
then post
request
request
response
fat arrow function
and here we'll write the response
hello this is
post
method
yes
this so let's save this
now we'll go to the terminal new
terminal and run this file
node
dot
server is running at
on 4000
now we'll go to chrome extension
here we'll write localhost 4000
but it can't get
so we'll write the request
post
request
and then enter as you can see
post request can't get host request
this is because post method is secure
and the data is passed in the request
body so it can't be fetched in the url
for that we need to open our
postman application
here we'll write
our
extension url
copy this
so
host method can only be faced on the
body part
so we'll paste it here
and send
hello this is post method
so
as you can see here in the postman
application you can see get post
put patch delete copy and all other
methods of express
