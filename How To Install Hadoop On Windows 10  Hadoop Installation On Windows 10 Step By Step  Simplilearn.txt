hello all hope you're all doing well so
today's topic is how to install hadoop
in windows 10. before moving please make
sure you subscribe to our channel and
press the bell icon to never miss an
update moving on to agenda
first we shall see prerequisites before
installing
after that setting environment in your
device
and finally hadoop setup so first of all
we need to install jdk for
your system
to install it you have to go to oracle
website and click on to this windows x64
version and click here to download
click on i reviewed and agree
and click on to download
you can see it is downloaded sometimes
it will ask for login and sign up so you
have to give your own email id and
password for that
so it will take some minutes to install
so prepare it to install click on next
next and
your file is being installed
so you can
install in some other folder to avoid
confusion
you can go to
this pc
and create new folder
name it as
java
and click on okay
so it is now being installed
to your system
so now you can see java essay
development kit is successfully
installed click on
close
next to download hadoop you have to
visit their official website and
click on
binary
to install hadoop you will get this
mirror link which is a tar file
and you can see it is started
downloading
and now you can see that the hadoop tarp
file is downloaded
now the next step is to
set environment variable you can go to
start menu go to settings
click on settings go to system
and click on
environment
edit environment variables
okay
now edit environment variables
click on environment variables
so now here click on new
and give
java
java underscore home
and you have to give variable value that
is part of jdk files up to bin
folder so
in environment variable
you have to
set the path for
system variables
and click on new
and give variable name and variable
value from the same jdk bin directory
so
after this click on ok and close all
this
so environment variable is set
we have to extract the
hadoop
tar file click on tar file
click on 7-zip and click on extract here
so that the star file is extracted in
your windows system
now you can see the hadoop file is
extracted
so
here these are the directories which
will be there now we have to
set up environment variables for hadoop
also before that we have to see whether
java or jdk file is being installed in
your system to do that you just have to
go to command prompt
click on command prompt and just give
the command as
java
c to check whether it is installed in
your system
here i am
after extracting how to file i am
extracting it another time because in
hadoop when we install
it and after that you will get another
tar file so we have to extract that tar
file also and we will get some errors
here so we can just ignore this error so
in our system hadoop is successfully
extracted and we can click close
so next step what you can do is just
copy the hadoop file and paste it in
another folder like c folder to avoid
confusion now that you have copied it
you can click on etc
and after that you will get
many files
like many files so we have to select
only five files and change the
configuration of that xml file
so they are one is coresight
and afterwards hdfs site and afterwards
we have to
change map reduce site
this is the xml file
and after that we have to change jan
file also
so the last file that we are going to
edit is hadoop environment
file so this will
this we will edit by using
command prompt
here all you need to do is right click
click on edit with notepad
and
write the code here to change the
configuration
so the xml files that we are going to
edit now is
coresight.xml
htfsi.xml
mapreduceside.xml and yarn.xml and
another file that we are going to edit
will be in command from
and the last file that we are going to
edit through command prompt
so first let's look at coresight.xml
so this is the code
that we are writing in codesight.xml
this is the selected code that we have
to write
after that let's move to hdfsi.xml
so before editing how to folder we have
to create two files
inside hadoop
so in this
page we have to create another folder
we can name it as
data
inside that we have to create two more
folders one is name node and another one
is data node
let me create two folders
called as
name node and data node
so in hdfs site dot xml
we are writing this code
to get the configuration
so this is the path of name node and
this is the path of data node that we
have created recently next let's see
mapreduce site file
this is also an xml file we have to
write
this much code this is a small bit of
code that we need to write
with name value and property tax
in
yarnside.xml file we have to write this
code with same name value and property
tags this is all we need to write in xml
sites now the last file that we are
going to edit is hadoop environment that
we can edit
in this
java home by giving the path of the jdk
file that we have created in environment
variables
we have to set environment variable
using
just go to system and click on this
option and you can set both environment
and path variables like how we did in
jdk after your path variables and
environment variables are set your
hadoop installation is done now we have
to check
whether hadoop installation is
successful or not to do that you have to
go to command prompt
all you need to do is
click hdfs
name node
name node
and
hyphen format
and this is the command that you need to
run to check whether hadoop is installed
properly in your system or not
so this is how you need to install
hadoop in your system thank you for
