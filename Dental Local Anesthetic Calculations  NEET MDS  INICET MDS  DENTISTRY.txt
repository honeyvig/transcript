hi everyone now i'll be talking about
the third part
of local anesthesia so it's very very
important thing that
now we'll be discussing about the
calculations
related to the local anesthesia and most
of us
we are phobic towards the numbers okay
so you're phobic towards the mathematics
so but these are very very important and
i'll try my best to make it as simple as
possible
so before going into the calculations
there are few statements
and few things that you have to learn
the first thing is
x percentage of eliminates so so many
times we heard a term like
two percentages of lignocon four
percentage of leader kind zero point
five percent is of the peak right
so what does it what does the percentage
means so x percentage
of local anesthesia means so say very
simple
make a note percentages are always
calculated for 100
okay so x percentage of
lidocaine or x percentage of a kind
means it's very simple that it contains
x grams of la
in 100 ml
of solution
it's very simple as i said percent is
always calculated for 100
x percentage means x grams of
la in 100 ml of solution
so this is the first thing that you have
to make a note most of the times
you will find this percentage what is
percentage means
the second thing that you have to find
how much amount of solution is present
in
one catalyst okay so this is regularly a
catrice and whatever we regularly used
in our oral surgery departments are
syringes okay we regularly use uh
foreign we use
2 ml syringe because syringe is
different
okay cataract is different but cataracts
will contain 1.8 ml so in most of the
situation
okay so they can ask you cataracts or in
indian scenarios they can ask you
the syringes so it's going to be
somewhere around 1.8 ml
or the 2 ml okay so i hope you
you are very clear with the amount of
solution that is present in one catalyst
and amount of solution that is present
in one syringe
the third important ok this is how the
questions will be
so how much lignochine is present in
2 ml of 2 percentage of little kind
solution so we have learned x percentage
means
x grams in 100
ml okay now it is two percentage two
percentage means
two grams in 100
ml okay so what happens if it is
1 ml according to the mathematics in the
same solution
it is going to contain 0.02 grams
but it is clearly given how much present
in 2 ml
so it is going to be 2 ml
it's going to be 0.04 grams
or if you convert that grams into
milligrams
it's going to be 40 milligrams so the
answer is
a for this particular question so
similarly they can ask
how much amount of lidocaine is present
in
one catalyst one characterise of two
percentages of lithography so one
catalyst
will almost contain the same either it
is 1.8 ml or you can consider it as
2 2 ml on the options so the question is
the same the answer is same that is
it contains how much amount of lidocaine
is present in one catalyst or how much
amount of lidocaine is present in
2 ml 2 percentage of solution i hope
you're very very clear with the first
part
the first part clearly says that x
percentage
what is x percentage means x grams of
local anesthesia is present in 100 ml of
solution
okay then how much amount of solution is
present in the catalyst
it is 1.8 so x grams in 100 ml
okay then how much amount of solution is
present in one catalysis
how much amount in 2 ml 100 ml
having x grams 2 ml is how much
is the question so that is the first
level
the second level the maximum doses of
local anesthesia
with adrenal level and without
adrenaline is again the most commonly
asked questions for example
if it is without adrenaline then it is
4.4
milligrams per kg body weight if it is
with adrenaline it is 7
milligrams per kg body weight now the
questions can be
it's very clear like they're asking per
body weight per
kg body weight so they can ask you for
40 kgs
male or something like that so what you
have to do is
if it is with adrenaline you have to
multiply 7 into 40 it's going to be
280 milligrams
okay this is the question the maximum
dosage of local anesthesia
with adrenaline in a 40 kg is male is so
1 kg we have learned it is 7 milligrams
per
1 kg now it is 40 gauges
so 7 into 40 it is 280
milligrams is the answer
so this is the maximum amount of local
anesthesia
with adrenaline that can be given to
this particular
individual who has entered the
department
next one maximum acceptable doses of
adenoline maximum acceptable doses of
adrenaline
for a normal patient and maximum
acceptable doses of adrenaline for a
cardiac patient
if it is normal patient it is 0.2
milligrams
if it is cardiac patient it is 0.4
milligrams again these are the most
commonly
asked direct single liners for you
with in a normal patient is 0.2
milligrams
in a cardiac patient is 0.04 milligrams
this is the maximum that you can give to
the particular patient
the next comes this is the next level of
question so we have learned level one
level one is x grams of l a means
x gram sorry x percentage of alia means
it is
x grams of l a in 100 ml so the next
level is
how much see this how many categories of
two percentages of lidocaine
mechanics without adrenaline are given
to an individual of 50 kgs
okay so we have learned that 50 without
adrenaline is 4.4
milligrams per kg body weight right
that is without adrenaline
so it is 50 gauges so 4.4
into 50 cages is 220
milligrams so this is the maximum that
you can
give to this particular individual okay
so now you have to calculate
the percentage so 2 percentage means 2
grams
are present in how much are present in
100 ml
now the question is now the question is
2 ml will contain how much because 2 ml
will contain
40 ml milligrams okay
so means one cat race or one syringe
one syringe is going to contain 40
milligrams
and maximum you can give to that
particular patient is 220 so how many
syringes of
local anesthesia that you can give so it
is going to be
220 by 40.
it it's going to be somewhere around 5.4
so you can give 5.4 cat raises of
solution
okay but there will be no 0.4 categories
of solution so the maximum that you can
give
to this particular patient is 5
syringes or five catalyzers sixth cannot
be given so the answer is
five five point four you don't have five
point four categorizes so six should not
be given six
will lead to overdoses so six should not
be given
so the maximum that you can give to this
particular patient is five
so they can ask you like they can ask
you what is the
what what is for four percent is they
can ask you for 70 kg something like
that so get prepared
for such type of questions so i hope you
are clear first level now this say this
is the second level of
handling the calculation based question
of local anesthesia
the next one so until now we heard ex
percentages
of lignocoin x percentage of bupivaca
and something like that
so the next level of questioning is one
is to
x means they are going to tell you about
the vaso constructor that is the
additional content like one is to one
lakh
one is to two lakh one is to three like
is a regularly asked question what does
it mean one is to x
of vasoconstrictor or one is to x
of adrenaline or one is to one lakh of
adrenaline means what does this
statement really gives an information
it is one gram of
admiring that is present in xml
okay so one gram of adrenaline that is
present in xml clearly
so if if the same is given it is one
gram
of vasoconstrictor
that is present in 1
lakh ml of la
so how much is present in 1 ml of
la so one gram
by this value they can ask you
how much is present in one solution that
is one catalyst
one catalyst will contain two ml or one
pointed so it is
one gram by 1 lakh
into 2
so this is how you have to calculate so
such
questions are also there on your basic
mcq books and of course you you'll get
exposed to such questions
uh in your daily topic specific exam
okay so this is what uh that you have to
make a note when we are talking about
the calculations related to the
local anesthesia one calculation related
to the local anesthesia
is going to be the amount of local
anesthesia that is
x percentage the second calculation is
going to be
on the number of cartridges if you know
the maximum doses
by number of number amount of local
anesthesia in each syringe
is going to give you the maximum amount
of syringes third one is
one is to x ratio this is related to
vasoconstrictor that is adrenaline this
is related to the
amount of local anesthesia so practice
these
two or three types of calculations with
different numbers
you can ask your friend to throw or
prepare a question
okay series of five or six questions and
you solve them and you prepare some four
or five questions you ask your friend to
solve them
by which you get command over the
concept one and command over the
uh number solving in your local
anesthesia uh done for now
