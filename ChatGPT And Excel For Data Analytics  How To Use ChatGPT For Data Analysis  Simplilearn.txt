let's get started and unlock the
potential of chat GPD for data analytics
together and guys if you're one of the
aspiring data analyst looking for online
training and graduating from the best
universities or a professional who
elicits to switch careers with data
analytics by learning from the experts
then try giving a short to Simply learns
Purdue postgraduate programming data
analytics in collaboration with IBM the
link is in the description box that will
navigate you to the course page where
you can find a complete overw of the
program being offered so let's get
started guys so guys an Excel data
analyst always looks for ways to improve
their efficiency and gain deeper
insights from the data that's where CH
jbt comes in handy so chat jpt is an AI
powered language model that can assist
you in various task including Excel
based data analysis and for that data
analysis let's dive into some demos to
see how it works so guys as you can see
this is the chat JT 4 and you could see
this has the support of D browsing and
Analysis and usage limits May apply like
we have the version that has some usage
limits and for the data I have
downloaded the data from the
I will provide you the link in the
description if you want to download the
same data you can and I have that in my
downloads so this is the data that we'll
be using so the first thing we'll be
doing is data cleaning and preparation
so firstly let's explore data cleaning
and preparation before diving into
analysis it's essential to ensure our
data is clean and ready for processing
so for that we will write a prompt in
chat jpt and ask him to clean the data
chat jpt he has the feature to insert
the files provide the Excel file to the
chat jpt and we'll ask him that can you
help me identify and remove duplicates
in this Excel spreadsheet so let's ask
him can you help me identify and remove
duplicates duplicates from this Excel
spreadsheet from the
provided
Excel spreadsheet you could see that J
has started generating the response and
he is telling us that he can definitely
help us with that and he is analyzing
that so you could see that J has
provided us the response so let's first
go to our
spreadsheet so this is the spreadsheet
order number quantity
ordered price of each quantity and Order
lines so you could see that first CH GT
has encountered an error and that is
with the corrector and coding mpch and
then he has loaded the spreadsheet
successfully with the second attempt and
you could see that he has provided a
like the smaller or the briefer version
of the spreadsheet that is the data set
consist of sales data with column such
as order number quantity order price
each order line sales order date status
so he asking us could you specify how
you would like to identify duplicates
for example should be consider a row a
duplicate if all its values match and
another row exactly or are there
specifically columns we should focus on
to determine duplicates so we should or
here we will be focusing on the column
section so here we want to identify
by column
section so is asking which columns they
should identify duplicates so we want
the duplicates in order
number so the CH G has started analyzing
the
spreadsheet
so you could see that CH GT has
addressed the response that they have
identified a total of
287 rows in the spreadsheet that have
duplicates based on the order number
column so this indicates that multiple
rows share the same order number
suggesting there might be different
items or transactions within the same
order would you like to proceed by
removing these duplicates while keeping
either the first or last Ence of each
order number or do you have another
approach in mind for handling these
duplicates so before identifying the
duplicates what we will do is we will
first get rid of the extra spaces so
we'll ask CH gbt
that first
find the Extra
Spaces in the
spreadsheet
and help us remove
them
so you could see that it has started
analyzing
it so he is asking us that would you
like to proceed with any further
cleaning or data manipulation yes we
going to proceed further with data
cleaning only and now we will treat all
the blank cells if there are
any now treat
all the blank
cells if there are
any so the spreadsheet contains blank
cells in the following columns with the
respective counts of blank entries that
is address line to has 2521 blank sales
than the state so depending on
preference or the requirements of data
analysis we can treat these blank cells
in several ways such as filling them
with the place holder value that is not
provided using a specific value that
makes sense for data that is example a
default state of TI but potentially
leaving them as if blanks carry
meaningful information in the context of
your data so what we'll do we will
provide a
placeholder provide a placeholder
instead that
is not provided or not applicable
okay so would see in that has responded
that it has replaced the blank cells in
the columns that is address line two
state postal code and territory with the
placeholder node provided so you could
see there's a verification sample
showing the updates so this is how you
could clean the data and now with chat
jpt you can quickly identify and
eliminate duplicates in your Excel
spreadsheet using build-in functions and
formulas saving your time and effort so
that would be done by the chat jpt and
you can download the Excel file from the
chat GPD only after that you can just
ask him that provide me the output or
the resulted spreadsheet so if we talk
about now data analysis and
visualization let's delve into that so
Excel offers powerful tools for
analyzing and visualizing data and chat
jpt can help you make the most of them
so for this also we'll write a prompt to
the chat jpt and we'll write for example
we'll write please create a pivot table
and a corresponding chart to analyze
sales performance by region so let's see
like this prompt what output does chj
show to us so let's ask him please
create a PV
table and a
corresponding chart to
analyze sales performance by
region
so you would see that jut has started
analyzing the data and the spreadsheet
and you could see that the pivot table
below shows the sales performance per
region or the territory so this table
indicates that the EMA region has the
highest Sal performance followed by
regions where the territory was not
provided then Apec and finally Japan so
now let's create a chart to visually
represent this sales performance by
region you could see that it has
provided a chart that is a b chart
illustrating the sales performance by
Tory so you could see the guys that it
has provided us the analysis and CH jpd
can guide you through the process of
creating pivot tables charts and other
visualizations in Excel enabling you to
gain valuable insights from your data
with ease so let's move to Advanced
analysis and automation so lastly we
will explore Advanced analysis and
automation so Excel capabilities extend
beyond basic functions and chat jpd can
help you leverage its full potential and
for this also we write a prompt to the
chat jpd that can you assist me in
building a forecasting model to predict
future sales based on historical data
present in the spreadsheet so let's see
what Chad j respond to us so let's ask
him can
you assist me in
building a forecasting
model to predict future
sales based on historical
data so let's see what CH J respond to
us so you could see that building a
forecasting model to BU future sales
based on historical data in several
steps so for this you have to prepare
the data select a model train the model
evaluate the model and make predictions
so let's start by preparing the data
we'll aggregate sales by order date to
create a Time series of total daily
sales then we'll choose a model based on
data's characteristics so we
will grant the permission to chat gyy to
proceed with the steps so we started
analyzing the
data so you could see that that the data
has been prepared into a Time series of
total daily sales and before choosing a
forecasting model it's helpful to
visualize the sales time series to
understand its characteristics such as
Trend and seasonality so Chad JPY has
fled a daily sales data and then he has
given the visual Trends and the possible
seasonal patterns and the next steps
would include testing for stationarity
more model selection and parameter
touring model training and then
forecasting so you could follow all
these steps with the help of chat GPT
and could create a forecasting model if
you want we can move to the next step so
you could like provide a PR to the chat
chipy that move
to or proceed with Next
Step so step by step ch will provide you
a forecasting model or it will help you
create a forecasting model as you can
see it has started analyzing it to the
augmented D Fuller that is ADF test
gives up a P value of approximately
0.0033 since this P value is less than
the common significance level of 0.05 we
can reject the null hypthesis that the
time Series has a unit meaning the time
series is stationary so you could see
that he is asking us shall we proceed
with the Sima model parameter selection
yes here is the model parameter
selection so you could select any based
on the trends and the bar graphs ploted
by the chat
CH so you could see guys that the chat
chity has analyzed the spreadsheet and
provided the response that the grid
search for the optimal Sera parameters
based on the lower a information
Criterion suggest the best fit model
uses the parameter 011 and for ARA and
01112 that is for the seasonal component
so you could see that it has provided
the model and the parameters now he's
asking us shall we move on to
forecasting future sales with this model
yes proceed with that so you could see
that with Chad G's assistance you can
build complex forecasting models in
Excel allowing you to make informed
decisions and plan for the future
effectively so chat jpt is a valuable
tool for Excel users and data analysis
offering assistance in data cleaning
analysis visualization and Automation
and by integrating chat GPT in your
Excel workflows you can enhance your
productivity and uncover new insights
from your data so you can try chat GPT
for Excel data analytics today and take
your Excel skills to the new level and
you would see that uh there's an error
in the analyzing and he has encountered
an error while trying to plot the
forecast with its confidence intervals
so this type of error can occur due to
data type issues particularly when
handling data indices in forecast and
despite the siup the forecasting process
using the ca model was completed and we
were able to generate forecast for the
next 12 months unfortunately due to the
plotting issue we couldn't visually
display it so we will ask him can you
try once
again so you could see that this time
Shar gbt has provided us the forecast
for the next 12 months that is the
forecast have been successfully plotted
along with the historical daily data so
here we have our forecast model and with
the chat G's assistance we can move with
other analysis also and with that guys
