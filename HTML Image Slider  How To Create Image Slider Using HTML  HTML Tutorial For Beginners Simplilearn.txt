hello everyone
welcome to this video on html image
slider by simply learn
in this video we'll learn how you can
create a beautiful html slider by using
just html and css a little bit of
javascript
so without further during our time let's
get started
our image slider looks something like
this
we have the background image and those
images that i have taken
for example purpose we have these radio
buttons and we click on the radio
buttons
we can go through our images one by one
also the images will change
automatically after sometimes as you can
see
so let's see how we can create this
image slider
so here in the desktop i have created
one file where i have the required
images
and html and css file
so first in the experiment style let's
add
slider
inside there i'll create another
which will be named as dim class slice
inside this big cat slides we'll add the
radio buttons
so input
the input type will be radio
and let's give this name
radio button
and we'll tag them with id radio one
so as you can see
we need four buttons here so we'll add
four radio buttons here
so just copy paste this four times
here change the id to radio 2 radio 3
and radio 4 so we can distinguish four
radio buttons
so after the creating the radio buttons
we'll add our required images so we'll
create android div and limit class
slide first
i'll create an image tag
and specify the path of the image
in a similar way we create a
four div tags for four images
so just
we'll do it simply
another with class name
slide
inside this image
2.jpg
so just save the file and let's recheck
our code
we have the radio buttons we have the
images so let's just go back to our file
and see how it looks
so if we refresh
we see we have the four radio buttons
here and some distorted images
so let's just fix this images in the css
so inside of css file
we'll add the body
and we'll set the margin to zero pixels
padding to zero
we'll set the height to say under
vertical height
we'll set the display to flip
we'll justify the content to center
we'll set the align items to center
and we'll set the background to black
so just
refresh this file
so we still need to fix these images
so just
set the slider width to
eight hundred to five
okay this there's an error we'll say
this bit not litters
we set the height
to 500 pixels
we'll set the border radius
to 10 pixels
and overflow will keep as hidden
for the slice part
we'll set the width to 500
height to 500 pixels
and display to select
so let's save the file and see how it
looks on the page
so yeah you can see the images now in a
proper size you have to fix this radio
button we have the background black
so let's fix the sims
so for the slide input
okay before starting this let's add some
more stable content here
so after adding the image we have to
create the automatic navigation button
and the manual navigation button
so after this
add another div
the class name
navigation
auto let's see
and inside this navigation auto will add
dev
truss
auto button one
we need the four button so we'll copy it
four times
and this will be my button two
this is the button three and this will
be button
outside this
will create another
navigation button so we'll name this
navigation
make sure it's spelled right navi
navigation
and inside this
we'll add our radio button usually
manually
we'll name it class
manual button
we need the code button so we'll copy it
four times
change the label to radio 2
radio 3 and radio 4
so i think
this will work enough so here we have
the navigation
okay we have a spell mistake here
div
class and navigation panel vista classic
so let's recheck our code it's a good
practice we check your code so that you
don't encounter any error so okay we
have a different slider here
and inside our zip close adder we have
the four radio button dd1 to c4
we have added our images
inside the div tags with the name slide
okay
we have created a navigation auto
the four buttons and navigation manuals
are the four buttons okay
so let's save the file and go back and
refresh it and see how it looks
okay
we have to add some css here
so inside the slides
input will get the display to done
two seconds
now we'll
add this type of image
we'll set the width to 800 pixels
and we'll set the height to say 500
pixels
okay
let's save the file and let's go back to
see how it looks right now
okay so you can see the images are
properly aligned here
we have to style our radio buttons for
here so let's go back to our css
navigation
so just add here comment manual slide
navigation
so
we'll add the first
class navigation manual
we'll set the position to absolute
then set the width to 800 pixels
will not have the height here will set
the margin
so the margin top will be
minus 40 pixels
and this will keep it as length
and the justify content
will be sent out
so let's go and
go back to the page to see how it looks
right now
okay the images are in the center you
can see
now we cannot see the radio buttons
just as now we have to add some color to
it so that the radio button will be
visible
so go back to the css
we'll add the manual button
we'll set the border
to
shape three pixels
solid and red
you can take any color you want
i will set the padding to five pixels
uh we'll set the border radius to say
nine pixels
we set the processor to point pointer so
that when whatever buttons the cursor
will look as a pointer
and we'll set the transition to one
seconds
save
go back and refresh
so now you can see the buttons are here
not properly spaced but yeah they're
here
so let's add the spacing and everything
else
so we will set the manual button
we'll set the margin
right to 40 pixels
and it's time to add the over effect so
for the manual
button
the google will be um save
background
the color
blue
so just save the file and go back and
refresh
yeah so you can see our manual buttons
are in place
when you hover over it you can see the
blue effect and when you click
nothing happens right now because we
don't have any javascript in response to
this later button
we'll add them in the end
first let's design these buttons so this
was for the manual button
now we'll add one code which will be
used when you want to save the reader
button by default
so let's understand how those video
buttons work in this file so the radio
version is used where two or more
options are identified which are
mutually exclusive and the user has to
do exactly one choice
in other words click on advanced
selected reader button will erase any of
the button that is selected on the list
previously
deliverables include lower cognitive
load as they permanently keep all the
options visible such that users can
easily analyze them
radio buttons are also simple to use for
users who have difficulty making
effective mass movements
so we'll add hash radio
dot checked
so the sign that we have added here is
more signaling combinator
it combines two sequence of simple
selectors having the same parent and the
second must come immediately after the
first
so
we add dot first
and for this we set the margin left
to zero
okay so this will be radio one
the label that we are added in our
manual buttons
we'll need four such
buttons so we'll copy this four times
one two three and four
this will be my for radio button two
and we'll set the margin left here to
minus 20 pixels
for radio button 3 then set it to say
minus 40 pixels
i'm going to forget to add
pixelation
and for the last button
we'll set it to minus 60 pixels
so all this code is for the manual
navigation button
now let's design for automatic
navigation button
so
we open dot navigation
we'll set the position to absolute
set the display to flat
we'll set the width
to 800 pixels
and we'll justify the content to the
now
so i'll add this tag to navigation auto
so
navigation okay
then set the border
to same wall that we have used here
let me shape it solid red
make sure you keep this sequencer solid
and same in both the navigation auto and
navigation manual because if you change
the color here you will see the two
manual buttons there so
for
this example let's change this to green
so when you save and go back
and refresh
yeah
but you can see the two buttons there
this is a green and this is red so if
there are two colors the
both the buttons in overlap will not too
good so we'll just keep it here red
we'll set the padding to five pixels
we'll set the border radius to 9 pixels
and we'll set the transition to 1
seconds
now same code as here which i've added
for
checking out the radio buttons
so we'll just copy this whole code
and paste it here
i'll have to tweak some things here
so the class was navigation dot auto so
we'll add here
navigation
dot
auto button one
we will filter some background
so we will delete this code
um
background let's say
any color pink
so
copy this code control c
delete this whole thing
and just change the radio button there
this will be radio button
this will be three
and this will be four
now we have all the designing in place
now we have already designing in place
let's go back to the code and refresh
so now you'll see everything
the background is that that the images
is properly aligned we have this button
so let's click
so when you click you see the images
slides this is the fourth image
third
second
and first
so
your beautiful image slider is ready
all right now is left is to add the
javascript code to this image directory
function in automatic manner
so now we'll go back to this html5
and below this dev tag
will open one script tab
and inside the script tag
we create one
variable game counter
we'll set it to 1.
open recruitment function set interval
foreign
so
c
so what the specifically does is
we have created one
variable named counter and it would
check against the id that we have
created in radio
then the radio button is
checked and it encounters
the counter will be plus plus that
quantity increased by one
so
after the counter has reached the floor
so it will get back to the starting
point that is one
so
the whole point of the score is to make
the images slide in in a loop
so just save
and go back
now when you refresh
you will see the images will move after
sometimes
specifically two seconds
now when the images reach the last stage
it goes back to the first
you can also change it by clicking here
manually
so
