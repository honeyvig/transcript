analyze the data and then make decisions
based on the
data applications of data analytics now
the sky's limit on this in today's world
almost every business Act of Life your
music on your Spotify are driven by data
analytics but some of the big players
when you go in there job hunting are
going to be your fraud analysis uh if
you want to go make a lot of money and
you're good at it and you like dealing
with numbers uh go join the banks and
track down the criminals who are
stealing money it's a lot of you know
it's a big thing to protect credit cards
protect uh sales purchases bad checks
any of those things when you can track
them down is
huge Health Care exploding uh there is
everything from trying to find cures for
uh the coid virus or any of the viruses
out there uh using your cell phone to
diagnose different ailments uh that way
you don't have to go and see the doctor
you can actually just go in there and
take a picture of the funky growth on
your arm hopefully it's not too big and
then they send it in there and the data
analyst goes in there looks at it and
says oh this is what this is this is the
profal you need to go see or don't need
to see and that's just one aspect of
healthcare uh the databases being
generated by Healthcare and getting the
right doctors and helping the doctors
analyze whether something is uh benign
or malignant if it's cancerous all those
things are now part of the ongoing
Health Care growth in data
analytics Inventory management think one
of those huge warehouses where they're
shipping out all the goods how do you
inventory that in such a way so so that
uh you maximize the stuff that's being
purchased the most near the entrance and
all the other stuff towards the back or
even pre- ship it uh so it's huge to be
able to inventory the manage your
inventory and pretty soon they'll just
have a drone come in there and start
picking up some of those boxes and move
them around
also deliver your Logistics again this
goes from uh getting from point A to
point B uh you can combine it with our
inventory so you pre- ship stuff if you
know a certain area is more likely to
purchase it how do you get it the dely
to the most destinations the quickest in
the short amount of time and then they
even pre-stack the trucks going out and
that's all done with data analytics how
do we stack all that stuff so it comes
out in the right
order targeted marketing huge industry
any kind of marketing whether you're
generating uh the right content for the
marketing who are you targeting with
that marketing researching the people
what they want so you know what products
to Market out there all those things are
huge and these are just a few examples
you can probably go Way Beyond this from
tracking forest fires to astrology and
studying the stars all of this is part
of data analytics now and plays a huge
role in all these different
areas uh City Planning is another one
you know you can see a nice organized
City like this one where you can get in
and out of the neighborhoods if you're a
fir Tru uh police officers need to be
able to get in and out you want your
tourist to be able to come in yet you
still want the place to look nice and
you have the right commercial
development the right industrial develop
El like enough residence for people to
stay all those things are part of your
City Planning again huge in data
analytics so Sky a limit on what you use
it for let's take a look at types of
data
analytics and this can be broken up in
so many ways uh but we're going to start
with looking at the most basic questions
that you're going to be asking in data
analytics and the first one is you want
descriptive analytics what has happened
hindsight uh how many cells per call
ratio coming out of the call center if
we have 500 tourists in a forest and you
have a certain temperature how many
fires were started how many times did
the police have to show up to certain
houses um all that's descriptive the
next one is predictive Predictive
Analytics is what will happen next we
want to predict uh this is great if you
want have a ice cream store and you want
to predict how many people to work at
the ice cream store in a certain day
based on the temperature coming up in
the time of the year and then one of the
biggest growing and most important parts
of the industry is now prescriptive
analytics and you can think of that as
combining the first two we have
descriptive and we have predictive then
you get pre scriptive analytics how can
we make it happen foresight what can we
change to make this work
better in all the industries we looked
at before we can start asking questions
uh especially in City development
there's a good one if we want to have
our city generate more income and we
want that income to be commercial based
uh what kind of commercial buildings do
we need to build in that area that are
going to bring people over do we need
huge warehouse sales Costco sales
buildings or do we need little mom pod
joints that are going to bring in uh
people from the country to come shop
there or do you want an industrial setup
what do you need to bring that IND
industry in there is there car industry
available in that area uh if it's not a
car industry what other Industries are
in that area all those things are
prescriptive we're guessing we're
guessing what can we do to fix it what
can we do to fix crime in area with
education what kind of education are we
going to use to help people understand
what's going on so that we lower the
rate of crime and we help our
communities grow better that's all
prescriptive it's all guessing we want
foresight into how can we make it happen
how can we make this
better and we really can't not go into
into enough detail on these three
because a lot of people stumble on this
when they come in and are doing
analytics whether you're the manager
shareholder or the uh data scientist
coming in you really need to understand
the descriptive analytics where you're
studying the total units of furniture
sold and the profit that was made in the
past uh here we go into Predictive
Analytics predicting the total units
that would sell and the profit we can
expect in the future gear up for how
many employees we need how much money
we're going to make and prescriptive
Analytics finding ways to improve the
sales and the profit so we can uh sell
maybe a different kind of furniture uh
we're going to guess at what the area is
looking for and how that marketing is
going to
change data analytics process steps so
let's take a look at some of the basic
processing and what that looks like when
you're working with this
data so there's five basic steps uh the
five steps of processing and and this
changes and there's a lot of things that
go on when they talk about um agile Pro
programming the whole concept of agile
is you take some kind of framework like
this and then you build on it depending
on what your business needs so the first
step is data
collection and usually with a large
company you might have somebody who uh
is responsible for the database
management um you might have another one
where they're pulling apis and they're
pulling data off of uh maybe the Census
Bureau uh may be something very very um
specific uh domain specific so if you're
analyzing cancerous growths and how to
understand them then the data collection
is going to be those measurements they
take from the MRI or it might be even
the MRI images they've used those also
uh so there's a lot of things with data
collection and how to control that and
make sure it has uh what you need and is
clean and you don't have Mis information
coming
in uh once you have the data collected
there's a data
preparation uh so stage two is we take
that data and we we format it into
something we can use probably one of the
biggest formats that you see is when
you're processing text how do you
process text we'll use what they call a
one hot encoder and each word is
represented uh by a a yes no kind of
setup so it' be like a long array of
bits um that's one way to prepare it and
so you know bit number one is the bit
number two is has or whatever it is
other preparations might be if you're
using Neal networks you might be um
taking integers or float numbers and
converting them to a value between zero
and one that way you don't have one of
them creating a bias in there uh so
there's a lot of different things that
go into Data preparation that is 80% of
data science so we talk about the data
analytics which is a little bit more on
the math side and they usually say talk
about a data scientist kind of being the
overall prepare of this stuff you're
going to spend 80% of your data
preparation data exploration uh that's
the fun part this is where you're
exploring things uh and it is maybe 10
to 15% of what you do with the data you
spend with the data exploration it is
probably uh the most important step
because this is where you got to start
asking questions uh if you ask your
questions wrong you're going to get some
wrong information if you're working with
a company and they want to know the
marketing values then you really got to
focus on hey how do we generate money
for this company or fraud how do we
lower the fraud rate while still
generating a profit four data modeling
this is where we start actually getting
into the data code uh which model to use
that predicts what's going to
happen uh and then result interpretation
we want to be able to interpret those
results you usually see that in your
matplot library where you create nice
beautiful images so it shows up on their
dashboard for the marketing manager or
for the CEO so they can take a quick
look and say hey I can see what's going
on there you want to reduce it to
something they can easily read uh they
don't want to hear the scientific terms
they want to see something they can use
and we'll talk about that a little bit
more when we start looking at some of
