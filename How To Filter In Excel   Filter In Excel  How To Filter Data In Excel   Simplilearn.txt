now to get started with filters in Excel
we might have to switch to the Practical
mode so we are on the Excel spreadsheet
right now so we have some employe table
and we have some another table in here
which is about department and
designation and we also have and or
right so remember the symbols and is for
star and or is for plus now we have
converted our data set into a table by
control V option and now just select all
the data and by default table will give
you the filter option here but let's say
let's try to remove this filter and now
let's say we just have a simple table
now we want to add the filter option so
the shortcut way is just selecting the
entire table going to the Home tab and
selecting the editing group and inside
that you have the filter and sort option
just select that and done you also have
the functionalities where you can select
your own departments let's say I want
only admin analytics and development I
have this table the result here or if
say I wanted some other filter and I can
get it but what if you wanted to filter
your data based on formula without using
any kind of tools let's say it's your
interview question and your interviewer
asks you give me a filter data set
without using the filter tool how can
you do that now here comes a tricky part
it's simple just use equal to filter and
there you go you have selected the
filter and now you have three param
parameters array include fmt so these
particular parameters stay for a
different meaning array is the return
array what values you want to return so
your your uh manager ask or your
interviewer asked you to give you only
the employee names which are working in
Department then your return value will
be employee column which is B which is
employee need right and if you wanted
the entire table Give me the give me all
the details of all the employees who
working in development team then you'll
be selecting the ENT ire table right now
let's select the entire table let's go
with the Second Use case I'll select the
entire hidden are as the entire table
now include this is the condition
include parameters for condition now I
wanted employees working in development
team right so I'll select the department
table and Department I mean Department
column and the department column value
should be equals to what this develop
right so get me the values of Department
table where the value is equals to
development this is my condition and the
last one is ifm this is just a written
value in case if the values are not
found right so I'll give it as not found
itself and now close the bracket enter
now you have all the employee details
who are working in development team now
let's say you wanted employees who are
working in a development team as well as
testing team now it is similar to an or
condition right so that's when you use
the or condition over here and you get
the values it's like you're giving
multiple parameters now it's not
possible to add a comma and add another
condition because this particular filter
function goes with only three parameters
now if you are adding a comma and adding
another condition it will be considered
as a fourth parameter now we won't uh
now we won't uh want that to be
happening right so we don't want that to
be happening so how do you modify the
existing condition that is the second
parameter it's really simple just use
make use you know you can just make use
of some brackets so close the bracket
and now we are looking for employees who
are working in both I mean who are
either in development or in testing
right so it's like an or condition so
for or condition The Logical symbol is
plus right so similarly again you will
be selecting the department and the
value should be equal to let's say
testing so I'll add that testing part
over here in L2 and close the bracket
there you go you have added the second
condition now next copy this testing
value and add it in cell L2 which was
our second condition I mean second part
of the condition there you go now you
have all the employees for are working
in development or testing right and
that's how you use filters in Excel
let's say you wanted to extract details
of employees who working in both uh you
know there are there might be situations
where you want uh to use and condition
so in those particular situation just
replace that plus with the and symbol
that is star symbol and that should work
and that's how you use filters in Excel
and that's how we got to the end of this
