that said let's get back to the training
session for today so Dax is basically
the data analytics expressions and in
Dax we have a lot of Dax functions
namely aggregate date and time filter so
this is filter One Financial functions
information Math logic and many more so
we are covering one after the other Dax
functionalities in our powerbi playlist
we have already covered aggregation and
date and time functions now we are going
to start with Filter functions now what
exactly is a filter this is a
straightforward question and you will be
expecting a straightforward answer right
you will be applying some filters or
conditions based on which you will try
to filter out and extract the data let's
say we have four years of data 2021 2 3
and 4 and you wanted to take a look at
the latest data from 2023 to 2024 what
you do is just apply a filter change the
dates and apply the condition that I
want the date from 2023 to 2024 and rest
everything you can leave and the data
will be extracted so as simple as that
so uh we're not just covering that basic
filter here so we will be covering some
most frequently used and latest updated
filters in PBI like the calculator
filter so there are types of filters
filters for one dedicated page and all
filters and after that some lookup
values match buy and match functions
fuzzy match offset AUD bu Partition by
range right so and window so these are
the newly updated uh filter functions
and apart from that all everything is as
the same old Power Pi so a few of them
are recently updated in the recent times
now let's get back to the um functions
which are we will be discussing today so
this is the first one which is the
filter function apart from that we will
take a look at the lookup value so when
it comes to lookup value if you are
someone who knows Excel then you might
be wondering lookup is the best maybe
one of the best features to look for
value and extract the detail so we have
multiple lookup functions which is X
lookup we have V lookup we have H lookup
and if you're not a big fan of lookup we
also have index match which is also an
alternative the best alternative to
lookup functions but when it comes to
excel it's 100% reliable but when it
comes to PBI of course we can say it is
reliable but as far as your data doesn't
have any discrepancies let's say I'll
give you a simple um use case so so
let's assume that in this use case you
are dealing with um School data so rule
number one rule number two and rule
number three so U rule number one has
someone named as Jack and role number
two has someone named Jackie right so if
you are using a fuzzy match let's say
you are don't want to okay when it comes
to fuzzy match I'll let you know what
fuzzy match does so what fuzzy match
does is let's say j a c k are the first
four letters j a k i e okay let me open
up a simple spreadsheet so I so that I
can tell you in a much better way so uh
FC one and let me also open up
fc2 so here we have uh two different
files right so here you can have some
customers data LS ballot and here we are
missing a d and in Ben feda here we are
having some case sensitivity so the
second name f is capital and here the
second name f is small so what is
happening here is there is a slight
discrepancy maybe a spelling mistake
maybe a case sensitivity right so pubi
assumes both Ben feda and the second Ben
feda are two different entities right in
such scenarios and in in a few in a few
other situations where you are dealing
with data duplications maybe uh the
username for a dedicated ID username
Jack for user ID one and user ID 2 is
also having a name as Jack right there
might be two different Jacks right so
Jack one is different and Jack two may
be different correct two people can have
same names so in such scenarios the
lookup might not work properly so in
such situations we will be using some
alternate functions there so it's like
the calculate function so we will also
have a demo on that after that we have
uh the match by so that's that's where
we'll be discussing about the fuzzy
match and we have offset so you'll be
having a deep understanding of offset if
you are some one who deals with
databases on a daily basis and that is
something new which has been covered in
powerbi and along that you have aut by
Partition by so these are the few
different functions we will be learning
today so that is the brief introduction
of this today's session now let's
quickly switch to powerbi and try some
practical demonstrations so there you go
we are in the uh report view right now
let's quickly shift to table view so
here we are dealing with uh four
different tables this is our ORD table
customers table and sales table right so
in our previous session we dealt with
data modeling where we had multiple
tables and we kind of establish a
connection right so I'll if I want to
try to establish a connection I'll just
drag and drop this matching customer IDs
with the other tables and basically get
the connection between them I can model
the data table right and if you are not
a fan of doing this manually you can
also get that done from from probi
itself from the options which is
mentioned in the previous session so um
so far so good so here we will start off
with uh you know look up values now we
have customers data correct so when you
look at the customers data we have kind
of 1 2 3 4 five six columns customer ID
customer name where does he or she
belong to where is the state country
region is it Central north right and
this is the basic information we have
and when it comes to orders we have
order ID customer ID order name order
date and when it comes to sales this is
what we have here and shipment is about
the order date and shipment shipping
mode right now what happens is you're
about to present this data to your
client or your manager and here she
wants a little more detail let's say he
doesn't know to uh build a chart build a
visualization
he just anything right so he just wanted
to add one more detail to this
particular table he wants to know which
product did to be order right so he
wanted to have the product name right in
front of customer's name so how would
you do that so it's a simple lookup
function right now here we have the
lookup function so let me erase that so
it's simple you just select the okay let
me also remove this from the model just
right click and you will be getting the
option of delete this from the model
okay let's create it from the scratch
now I just have six tables let us assume
that we wanted to add a new column here
right so it's simple you just select the
table right and after you select the
table it will be basically in the Home
tab now after you select the table you
get the table tools right and here
select the option of new column correct
so a new column will be generated now
you can maybe name the column so I'll
name it as
product
ordered equals to so lookup so it's not
a v lookup it's not a h lookup it's you
know there's no dedicated name to that
it's just named as lookup value so I
presume it's a x lookup anyways so
that's how you access the lookup
function now what you are looking for
what are you looking for basically if
you're dealing with Excel you write the
lookup function not the result right you
actually give the address or reference
of the cell where you have the value
which you are looking for but here you
are focusing on the result what you want
it to have there so we want the product
name here right we not giving a cell
reference where you have a look of value
it's not that way what you're expecting
to have in your column we are expecting
we expecting to have the product name
right so the product name various
product name so the product name is
inside sales table you can see product
name over here right so go back to your
uh look up function here you will have
the name so the table name is sales so
you have sales and you're looking for
product name press St to select there
you go now search column so search
column is let's say in Sal table you
have customer ID and product name and in
customer table you have customer ID and
customer name correct so there is a
primary key in customer table that is
customer ID and here you can reference
customer ID as a foreign key from sales
table right so what you're going to do
is you have the product name so you now
are looking for the customer ID right in
sales table in customer ID column what
customer ID is there in front of a
product name correct so okay let's not
complicate this let me open the sales
table so here you have the product name
right so now you have given the the
first lookup value you have given the uh
okay let me open the function okay so
you given you've given the required
result you've given the name now you are
pointing to this customer ID right so
you are pointing to this customer ID so
for the respective customer ID you're
trying to extract the product name so
that's the basic approach now so we have
given the first uh value now the second
one second parameter is search value
that is sales customer ID press after to
select and the last one search value so
what you're looking for so you're
looking for the customer ID from the
customers table so what you have to do
was uh customers table customer right
press stab to select now close the
bracket and if you enter you will get an
error that was expected as we discussed
before so the problem is one customer ID
might have purchased different products
correct so uh TS
2134 might have purchased um some
product from technical uh category and
some product from uh Furniture category
correct so what lookup is thinking is it
is thinking it is a duplication of the
entry so it is understanding it in this
way so I can't extract so basically
lookup will extract one value right now
here what happening what's happening is
this lookup function is trying to
extract multiple values right so that's
what it is saying a table of multiple
values was supplied where a single value
was expected correct so there is a look
around for this now basically I just
wanted to help you understand how a
lookup function Works in this particular
scenario so to get the answer for this
question we might have to you know make
things a little little different and to
try to look around for the value so we
will use calculate function for this
particular one so calculate calculate
and uh first no first non blank press
select and uh
okay so what we doing is we are
implementing a calculate function so
let's say TS 21 3 40 has three entries
so what we are doing is the first
non-blank entry so the first row we are
selecting that particular one from the
sales product name and we're going to
filter all sales and wherever the
customer ID from customer table is
equals to the customer ID from sales
table we will pick those entries and
after picking those multiple entries we
will just pick the topmost value and we
will fill the product order just now
enter and uh okay I thought we should
refresh but automatically it got
refreshed and we have the names of the
product being ordered so that's how we
use the lookup function in pobi and
there is a turn around if Cas in in case
if your powerbi is unable to detect the
look up value that's what you can do but
there is another way might be a
difficult one you might have to check
your data set and make sure that each
and every entry is unique so that's not
uh that's not something which can you
can do overnight so this is a quick work
around for your lookup formula now if we
go back to the report stage and page one
here we have filters correct so the
basic filters and you don't have uh
filter by visual there are a few more
options if you just switched back to the
introduction of this course so we had uh
new functions which is filter by
visualization filter by a few more
operations it can apply filter to a
dedicated sheet you can apply filter to
the entire uh sheets right here you can
see the option add filters to this page
alone so we have page one and page two
so if you want to add a specific filter
to overall all pages you can add such
filters over here so these are the two
filters that we already know and how
they work now let's try a new filter
which is the filter by visualization let
me try to build a donut chart and drag
region into Legends and sales into
values right now what we have here is a
visualization so whenever you try to
build a visualization onto your page you
will find a new filter over here which
is named as filter on this Vision right
so what you can do is you can just drop
down and here you have a specific
filters that you can apply and maybe if
I want to apply filters for central
region I just add it and I get a central
region filter now if I maybe I want to
add the category sales I can also do do
that and uh let's say if I want to
dedicatedly find the sales that happened
inport Central and East I can do that so
that's a new addition to power not not
so great or not so out outstanding out
of the box but this is how it basically
works just an additional tool in the
Arsenal and uh filter by page so
basically that's the filter what you are
adding and want to work on this
particular dedicated page you can do
that if you want to add a filter that
works for all the pages you can do that
over here right so this was
filter by Visual and a few more new
filters that got addition to the powerbi
and uh if we get back to uh page one
page two and Page Three page one and
data view okay this is the data view so
far we covered calculate look up filters
now let's try to uh look around a few
more editions so if you go back to this
particular documentation from Microsoft
so here we have match by okay let's uh
discuss the fuzzy match so here as we
discussed before so these are the data
sets now let me open a new uh PBI window
and try to load that
data there you go let us import the
spreadsheets so we are importing the
first FZ1 fuzzy match one just select
the sheet and load data so we're not
transforming the data it's really small
and it's uh it's something which we
created just for a demo purpose so there
there are no problems with the data set
as for as I know so there is no need for
transforming you can just directly load
the data so we have the sheet one right
here and Sheet two should be shly
loaded yeah so the first data set is
loaded now let's try the second
one there you go now we have both
sheets let's quickly go to the table
view so that we have the table view
there you go now we are trying the fuzzy
match function right for that we should
be going back to the uh report View and
here here we should transform the data
as you can see uh the column header the
first row of the column header was
supposed to be uh considered as you know
the first row of the table was supposed
to be considered as the column header
but it's not so that is something which
can be fixed in transformation right so
apart from that let's go to the
transform data that we have here and uh
here you have the merge queries options
so you can merge it as new and in this
particular dialogue box you can use this
particular option which says fuzzy match
to perform the match so what does fuzzy
match does so fuzzy match is something
which gives you a threshold let's say if
there is at least maybe some match okay
so here we have Ben ferner and Ben
ferner right so there is something which
makes it different from the other that
is the uh capital F right so the case
sensitivity is something which makes it
different and if you the other ones like
Lis so a d is missing at the end in the
second name right so we can give powerbi
some thr maybe if you find a 90% match
you can consider it as one and the same
right that's what this uh fuzzy match
does and match does right so if you are
looking for an exclusive tutorial on
Match function in Excel and match
function in powerbi we do have those
tutorials we will have them Linked In
the description box below you can have a
look now we have loaded the sheet one
and this is the sheet two so here you
can add the fuzzy match and uh you can
also choose what type of merge you want
to do deal with it I'll go with the full
out one and that's done right and here
you have the fuzzy matching options
where you can give the threshold maybe
you can give ignore case match by
combining text pass and you can give the
threshold maybe as
90% and uh maximum number of matches
optional and transformation table
optional yeah that should be good enough
and you can establish a fuzzy match so
this is uh the next part of the tutorial
and uh so far so good now what's left is
maybe we can deal with uh okay let's go
with visal documentation so far we have
done with a lookup filter filter Visual
and match and so we are left out with
offset order by Partition by and range
so let's continue with that so let's
quickly close this window and re start
our
powerbi with the file so um our data set
is loaded and we have a simple table
over here so it will explain us about
the city wise sales or orders that we
have received Now using this particular
table we will try to ingest offset
window and index into this particular
data table now what exactly do you mean
by index offset and uh window right so
so offset is something uh okay let's go
to the offcial documentation and have a
clearer understanding of offset so
offset is something which returns a
single row that is positioned either
before or after the current row within
the same table by given offset if the
current row cannot be reduced to a
single row multiple rows may be returned
so what exactly this means so offset is
something which gives you the value of
of the previous element present in the
previous row to the current row so let's
say uhct the value present in row number
two which is the number of orders
received in Chennai then you will okay
let's consider offset works if you are a
user in SQL then you know that uh uh it
works in a different way right whenever
you give offset as zero it will point to
the first row right in our case in our
use case we wanted to extract the values
from the second Ru so the offset will be
one so what we are basically trying to
do is trying to Define some formula
where the powerp will understand how the
offset operations work in a data table
right and index is something uh you
already know it was it will just index
the values you have uh in your dat set
so uh basically index will return a row
an absolute position specified by a
position parameter within specified
partition sorted by specified order if
the current partition can't be deduced
to a single partition multiple rows may
be returned so keeping it simple not to
complicated index acts like the address
to a specific row right let's say you
wanted to access the row number three if
you provide a specific index it's like
the primary key it's something which
does not change it's something which
cannot be duplicated right so you
provide an index and it'll identify the
row and pull up right so basically what
you're trying to do here is just make
PBI understand what an offset is what an
index is and what a partition or ory and
what exactly is a window right so we
will now get started with defining these
things starting with index then we will
understand the next one which is offset
followed by that we will dive into the
uh window function where we will also
use some partitions and order by
functions uh having that said let's get
started with VI so there you go uh just
select the table or go to table tools
and let's use this drop down and here
you have the new column and now we will
get started with defining the index so
column it should start yes there you go
so this is our index we are trying to
calculate the number of orders and we
are indexing the value and we are giving
a minus two which will dedicate to the
next uh upcoming second one right so so
here let's say you wanted to find out
the last second R uh this one this entry
you can find it out and in case if you
wanted to find out the last but one you
can do it and if you wanted to find out
the first then one right so that's how
it works and uh yeah so just enter and
here you are giving the data set table
name and column name enter and you have
the index right now let's go ahead with
uh the next one which is about the
offset add a new column go to column
tools so we should be creating a new
column and uh this is my offset
calculate number of orders all selected
from the table and the category so we
are specifying the offset so uh we want
to point out to the first row so we
should be uh provided as
zero let enter we will now have our
offsets
there you
go there is a slight error that should
be fixed shortly maybe some error with
the data modeling or data connections
anyways let's continue I think uh the
last function is window so there's a
circular dependency identified uh we
should resolve that so basically what
we're trying to do is we are trying to
find out the difference between the
offset and uh the number of orders we
receive now let's proceed and create a
new
measure sorry new column so here we will
be trying to create a
window so there you go so there was a
small circular dependency issue that we
just fixed and uh here we have the
window formula and basically what we're
trying to do here is identifying the
number of orders we received and what's
the difference between what's the offset
and what's the window right it's giving
the uh entries present in the current
row so this is how you can Implement uh
the index offset window and few other
latest uh build functions in powerbi
like look up and match by fuzzy match
