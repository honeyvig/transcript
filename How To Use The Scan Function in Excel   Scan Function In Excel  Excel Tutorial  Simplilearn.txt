to find a data analytics program that
fits your experience and areas of
Interest now without further delay let's
get started so what exactly is a scan
function in Excel so scan function acts
as a function that helps you to do a lot
of things for example do a running total
of your numbers or sales or profits and
also act like a filter to dedicatedly
act as a filter and count specific sales
records or specific profit records of a
dedicated month year or month on month
you know something like that so
basically the scan function in Excel
progressively applied a Lambda which is
an additional function inside the scan
function to each element in an array and
returns an array of intermediate values
this function is particularly useful for
generating running totals cumulative
statistics or constructing sequences
based on array elements and specified
operations now let me quickly switch
back to excel workbook so here we have
the Excel workbook right so here we have
uh two columns one is for running total
and one is to calculate the running
total with scan so first we will execute
the running total with scan and then
I'll give you a shortcut method to find
out your running totals apart from that
if you can see here in the columns G to
K we have additional details so remember
I told you that it can also work as a
filter to count dedicated data from
provided Lambda month or something right
so we will also execute something like
that using a filter now let's quickly
start with the scan function over here
scan function now initial value whenever
you're calculating running total start
with zero and after that you will add
zero to the first element that is 79.2
followed by that you will add 79.2 plus
42822 so initially scan will have the
value zero but when it comes to cell
reference E3 the initial value will
change from 0 to
79.2 right then it will add
79.2 to the next element which is in C3
that happens to be
42822 then or the running total of the
first two cells so that's how it
basically works now we have given the
initial value as zero followed by that
we have to give an array so our array is
in the C column which is about the sales
so just hold control and shift and use
the lower Arrow key to select the entire
array comma and here the function so in
initially you can work with the you know
directly adding the some function here
but in few situations it may not work
that's when you take the help of Lambda
you can give some random names to your
values let's go with the X comma y comma
the function which is addition right so
just give x + y and close the bracket
for Lambda and another closing bracket
for scan function now enter there you go
you have your running total so the
running total is
17,42
345 now let's try to find the running
total of U month let's say maybe
February maybe January or something like
that right so here we will add the okay
let me add
another now we will have the lookup
value here
and here you can add cou mon now equals
to let's go with the filter function now
the first uh requirement is array so
give the arrays basically your table
here you can just place your cursor on
the corner so that you can get an
inclined Arrow where you can just select
the entire
table let us go with the manual process
just control shift lower Arrow key so
that you can select the entire data set
that you want to give it and that's your
aring now
comma now we want to calculate uh let's
say the sales that happened in the month
of February correct so you can use the
month function to extract the month
now the month data is in the same table
you can get the first array here close
the month function is equal to the
lookup month over here and close the
filter now add the month here so the
month we're looking at is February month
just enter two and there you go now you
have the values or sales that happened
in the month of February Okay small
mistake here let's try to change the
date data
type so that you have the perfect date
right now uh this is completely Dynamic
and if I add the month march here it'll
give me the saes that happened in the
month of March and similarly let's try
for me there you go so now as discussed
before let me give you a quick uh
shortcut to find the running total which
is also Dynamic just go to the cell C2
select the cell shift control lower
Arrow key or control shift lower Arrow
key now here you can see a small popup
which looks like flash fi just open that
and here you can see various options go
to the totals option and here you can
just scroll yeah there you go you found
the running option just click on the
running uh total and you have it over
here right and let's say I change some
values here I change 79 to
805 and U this is dynamic it will also
give you the dynamic
results there you go right so that's how
you can use so you can see the same
number we have with the scan function as
well as the shortcut method and with
that we have come to an end of this
