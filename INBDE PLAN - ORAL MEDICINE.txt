happiness
this is dr srikant from team imbd concur
now i'm just here to give a glance about
the subject oral pattern oral medicine
okay
so before you start this particular
subject that is
oral path and oral medicine of course
you are well familiar with this oral
path
which is your third year subject whereas
medicine is a final year subject right
it's a fourth year subject but if you
just have a glance and just analyze your
stuff related to the integrated national
boards which is available for you
in online okay so they regularly like
ignore or not very specifically they
never mention this oral path
okay the reason is very simple because
the overall path will always get
integrated with oral medicine
okay so in oral medicine they talk about
the few futures which are there in
oral pathology this is what and a part
of oral pathology will get integrated
with other subjects like your general
path because
general path uh when i talk about
national boards part one and part two
is very very important but now it is
being integrated to
integrated national boards there are
high chances that they may ignore few
concepts of the general path and they
may focus
more on the clinical features that that
will be covered in your
general medicine and in your oral
medicine so oral medicine
indirectly is going to be a combination
of your oral path
and oral medicine a part of a
general path a part of world
microbiology
a few such things will be covered
integratedly here for example if we take
the bacterial viral infections or if we
list out the fungal infections or if you
listed the spread of the
oral infections all these they move
around with a part of
microbiology here that is you can
consider it as oral microbiology because
general microbiology is very different
when you talk about oral microbiology
okay so such things will be a
combination of both
and in many futures like when you're
talking about this
cysts of orientogenic origin okay or you
talk about the salivary glands
or you talk about the diseases of bones
and joints
okay or you talk about physical and
chemical injuries most of these are
interconnected with the radiology part
of radiology okay so make sure
radiology is again you you you can
consider radiology as a two parts
okay one is part one and part two part
one will be focusing
more on the general aspect means what is
radiation what is radiation therapy
how the how the x-ray is being formed
how you are going to fix
it what is your developer what is your
fixer
and all those things how you take extra
oral radiography how you take intraoral
radiography or parallel angle technique
biceptic angle technique different
techniques of extra world
different techniques of extrovert all
this comes under the general part
general part will be discussing along
with radiology in the schedule
but now we will be talking about the
diagnosis related stuff of radiology
so radiology related to the diagnosis
means every disease
has one or less radiographic features
which we'll be discussing along with the
pathologies in the oral medicine i hope
you're very clear right so
a part of oral radiology will also be
integrated here
so this is how we have prepared these
integrated videos which covers the
cases which covers the radiographic
features which covers the diagram based
questions and everything because
nowadays if you see integrated national
words most of
them are concerned with the patient box
okay in the last online session uh
for the probate students of integrated
national birds we have discussed what is
this patient box how they are asking
questions because
patient box questions are very
conceptual things
if you are strong in the concept it is
easy for you to handle the question and
go with the right answer right
so we have discussed how the patient box
questions and everything will be there
so keeping all those in mind this chart
was prepared
okay and i want you guys to go ahead
with the schedule so i have given a
beautiful schedule covering this
uh subject because this subject is one
of the core subject
in the list of integrated national
boards which you cannot skip
you cannot go to the examination like uh
if you talk with
your seniors who are done with the
national boards if i talk with my alumni
students
because national birds is just like a
passer fail exam
okay means when you are planning to go
for exam in a critical situation
you can ignore few subjects even then
even if you ignore one or two minor
subjects even then you crack the exam
you come back and crack the exam
students simply telling that sir we
are not done with two or three subjects
or i'm not a hundred percent sure of my
preparation but uh
for the gods grace i have done with my
exam i got the results sir this is the
past
so most of them they this is a very
common thing but that we regularly hear
but
make a note if you are doing that
this subject cannot be ignored you
cannot leave this subject and go to the
examination because this subject
is going to be high scoring subject and
of course
interesting and easy right so
what my concern is uh you can just
follow the schedule the schedule which
was given to you
and we have
videos okay you have smart videos
smart videos covering all these subjects
and of course i want you guys to finish
i got along with the smart videos i want
you guys to finish the
dental decks parts of this oral medicine
uh hardly you have like uh i mean like
the topics what i have segregated hardly
you have
12 to 15 cards each maximum is 12 to 15
sometimes you find like two to three
cards related to each subject
but make sure you try to integrate the
cards to that of the
video discussions what are available on
your website
right so that is first four most
important thing that you have to make
you know
and if you open your mass base part two
most based part to book okay so you
don't have a specific
subject called as oral medicine but you
have something called as oral diagnosis
so your mass base part two oral
diagnosis has to be again integrated
okay it's something like it's something
like it's going to be like a shortcut
okay for example they're talking about
amyloid blastoma they focus on key
important things clinical features
they move to the radiographic futures
talk about few radiographic features
then move to the treatment plan this is
going to be five or ten lines maximum
then they shift to the next one if
they're talking about cysts radical
assist how it occurs
clinical features and followed by the
treatment simple like we regularly
follow the same pattern okay for example
if you're talking about a disease
make sure uh the other names of the
disease means the synonyms of the
disease
followed by ethiology of the disease
followed by any classification release
related to the disease severity
classification some
sometimes you have a severity
classification so before i mean like if
it is up to this size
this is small this is large this is like
you have the severity-based
classification or sometimes
a disease may have a normal
classification it is divided into
classical type
or idiopathic type some some
classifications will they do that then
after i want you guys to move to the
clinical features
very specifically you should focus on
oral clinical features because most of
your
patient box questions i was talking
about something called as patient
box questions most of your patient box
questions will move around the clinical
features followed by
add a note about the radiographical
features or any
any microbiological features or
biochemistry
related investigations and followed by
the treatment plan this is this is a
regular thing this is what the pattern
that is being
followed in this specific book which you
should not miss that is most best
part okay so these are the two mandatory
things i want you guys to do in the
round one and integrate them with the
smart videos
that is more than sufficient so every
topic
which was listed in the previous slide
we try to provide as
many mcqs as possible and specifically
i'll try to add our cues
i'll try to add rqs that are the recent
questions which are taken from different
sources okay
so they will be added and of course as i
already mentioned you have
two live classes each of two end of
hours the dates of these live classes
will be updated very soon on to the
permanent groups
of this integrated national board
students okay so
we'll update you about the live classes
live classes mostly will try to solve
the patient box questions okay and uh
you you'll get more often like questions
related to the
recent recent things like things which
are being asked in the exam
okay recently in the recent sessions all
those things will be covered in the
arcades and during this session of
that is the oral medicine and oral
pathology we are going to have in a
session by dr sirisha
uh she's going to explain you all the
stuff related to the processing of your
processing the first step of processing
of your
integrated national boards what are the
steps that you have to take what are the
things that you have to follow
and a few suggestions about improving
your profile will be started by
dr sireesha during during this
particular subject
okay so i'm done for now signing off dr
srikanth from team imbd conquer
