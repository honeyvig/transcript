imagine you are trying to figure out
what most people in your neighborhood
love to eat for Desert you could ask
everyone right but how do you make sense
of all of these answers that's where
statistics comes in it's like your
personal data detective helping you
gather organize and analyze all the
information to spot patterns and Trends
with Statistics you can easily discover
if most people love ice cream or if
brownies are the hidden favorite all
about turning numbers and facts into
useful insights helping you make smarter
decisions and understand the bigger
picture hello guys welcome back to
Simply learns YouTube channel and today
I will work you through the basic
understanding of descriptive statistics
inferential statistics frequency
statistics and curosis statistics and
more then I will take you through the
differences among the various types by
the end of the video you will know for
all you want to know about statistics
and its types without any further delay
let's get into the video first things
first let us understand what statistics
actually is statistics is a branch of
mathematics that help us collect
organize and analyze data understand
patterns Trends and make decisions it's
like having a big group of information
and breaking it down to learn something
useful for example if we survey 100
people about their favorite fruit status
statistics help us figure out what most
people like what fruit is least liked
and how confident we are about these
results here after we have a basic idea
of Statistics let us get into the
various types of Statistics the first
one is descriptive statistics
descriptive statistics is a branch of
Statistics that focuses on summarizing
and describing the main features of a
data set this is further divided into
measures of central tendency measures of
spread and data distribution let's start
with measures of central tendency and
this is further divided into three types
the first one is mean the average of all
data points the second one is median the
middle value when data is arranged in
order the third one is mode the most
frequently occurring value let's break
down the measures of central tendency
mean median and mode with an example
imagine you have the following scores
from a math test taken by seven students
72 85 91 89 85 76 and 90 now you want to
calculate the mean now to calculate the
mean you have to add up all the scores
and divide by the number of students
therefore the mean is 84 it means the
average scores of the students is 84 now
moving on to find the median to find the
median we need to take the same example
and we have to arrange the scores in
ascending order the median is the middle
value so in this case the middle value
is 85 since it is the fourth number in a
list of seven so half of the students
scored above 85 and half scored below 85
now moving on the next is to calculate
the mode the mode is a score that
appears most often so we take the same
example and we see that 85 occurs twice
more than any other score so the most
common score in the test is 85 just a

now moving on on to the next that is the
measures of spread unlike central
tendency which tells you whether the
data is centered spread tells you how
scattered the data is it is three
components range variance and standard
deviation range it is the difference
between the highest and the lowest
values in the set and variance it
measures how much each score deviates
from the mean and standard deviation it
is the square root of variance let's use
an example to understand measures of
spread range variance and standard
deviation which help us understand how
spread out or disperse the data is
consider the test course of five
students now we want to find the range
therefore the range is the difference
between the highest and the lowest
values in the data set that is 85 - 65
is equal to 20 the scores span range of
20 points from 65 to 85 now moving on we
want to find the variance for the same
example
the variance measures how much each
score deviates from the mean on average
squared first we calculate the mean so
to calculate the mean we take the total
of the scores divided by the total
number of scores and that is equal to 75
next we find the square differences from
the mean for each score and here it is
65 - 75 whole squ is equal to - 10 whole
square and that is equal to 100 and in
this way we per form the same for each
score now the sum of the square
differences divided by the number of
data points is the variance and that is
taking the total of the squared
differences divided by five that is
equal to 50 the variance is 50 meaning
that on average the square differences
from the mean are 50 now moving on to
find the standard deviation the standard
deviation is a square root of the
variance it tells us how spread out the
data is in the the same units as the
original data the standard deviation is
the root over of 50 that is
approximately equal to
7.07 now moving on the third major
subdivision is data distribution let us
use an example to explain data
distribution which tells us how data
points are sprayed or organized across a
range of values imagine you have the
following test scores for 20 students
one way to understand data distribution
is by creating a histogram the histogram
groups the scores into ranges or beans
and shows how many scores fall into each
range for this data set we could create
bins like 50 to 60 there are three
students 61 to 70 there are seven
students and 71 to 80 we have five
students and in this way 81 to 90 we
have three students and 91 to 100 we
have two students now moving on to the
normal distribution the second one under
the data distribution in some cases data
follows an normal distribution which
forms a bell shaped curve and this means
most data points are around the mean
with fewer data points As you move away
from the mean in either direction and
normal distribution curve it means most
data points are around the mean with
fewer data points As you move away from
the mean in either direction in a normal
distribution the mean median and mode
are the same data is symmetrically
spread around the center now moving on
in our example the scores are somewhat
concentr red around 70 to 80 but the
distribution is not perfectly normal
because there are most students scoring
higher that is the right skew therefore
for skewed distribution sked
distribution if if a data set is not
symmetrical we have C distribution and
that is further divided into two the
right skew that is the positive skew and
the left skew that is the negative skew
in right skew more data points are on
the lower side with fewer higher values
and in the left skew more data points
are on the higher side with fewer low
values moving on in our test score
example we have a slightly right skew
distribution because there are more
students with lower scores that is to 55
to 70 compared to higher scores that is
9200 and this is known as right skew
distribution now moving on to the second
type of Statistics that is inferential
statistics it uses sample data to to
make predictions and generalizations
about a larger population allowing
researchers to draw conclusions beyond
the immediate data set inferential
statistics comprises several techniques
for drawing conclusions here are some
common
types hypothesis testing second one is
confidence intervals and the third one
is regression
analysis now moving on to hypothesis
testing hypothesis testing is a statical
method used to determine whether there
is enough evidence in a sample of data
to support a specific Claim about a
population let's work through the
process of testing whether a new
teaching method improves student test
scores breaking it down step by step
with some explanations to make it easier
to follow step number one is hypothesis
we always start by stating what we want
to test in this case we want to see if
the new teaching method helps students
score better compared to the traditional
one to do this we set up two hypothesis
0 that is the null hypothesis and that
is the average test score with the new
method is equal to 75 this means that
the new method has no impact and there
is no improvement in the test scores H1
that is the alternative hypothesis the
average test score with the new method
is greater than 75 this suggests that
the new method does improve test scores
in simple terms we are trying to figure
out if the new method makes any
difference compared to what we normally
expect which is a score of 75 now moving
on to the next step that is significance
level next we need to decide how
confident we want to be in our
conclusion the significance level helps
us measure this it tells us the
probability of mistakenly rejecting the
null hypothesis when it's actually true
type one error a common choice for this
significance level is 0.05 or 5% this
means we are willing to accept a 5%
chance of making a mistake by rejecting
the null hypothesis when it is true so
we said Alpha is equal to
0.05 step three collect data now we need
some actual data to test let's say we
taught 30 students using the new method
and their average test score came out to
be 78 this is our sample data and we
will compare it to the population mean
which is 75 the traditional method score
now moving on to the next St that is
perform statistical test the T Test with
the data in hand we need to perform a
statistical test for this test we will
use a t test which is which will help us
compare the sample means 78 to the
population mean 75 the T Test checks if
the difference between the two means is
significant or if it could just be due
to random chance moving on to the next
step that is P value the P value from
the T Test is a number that tells us the
probability of getting the sample data
if the null hypothesis is true let's say
the T Test gives us a P value of 0.03
this means there is 3% chance of seeing
this level of improvement if the new
method doesn't actually improve scores
now moving on to the last step that is
decision now we compare the P value to
our significant level Alpha if the P
value is smaller than 0.04 five it means
the results are statistically
significant and we can reject the null
hypothesis in our case the P value is
0.03 Which is less than
0.05 so we reject the null hypothesis
now moving on to the second part that is
confidence interval a confidence
interval is a range that tells us how
sure we are about an estimate from
sample data it gives a range of values
whether the true member likely false for
example
suppose you survey 100 men in a city to
estimate the average height the average
height from your sample is 175 cm and
the standard deviation is 10 cm you want
to calculate 95% confidence interval to
estimate the true average height of all
men in the city now let's move on to the
steps sample mean the sample average is
175 CM the standard error is calculated
as 10 by root over of 100 that is equal
to 1 now the confidence interval formula
for a 95% confidence level use the
critical value 1.96 the confidence
interval is 175 +us 1.96 into 1 that is
equal to 175 + - 1.96 the result the 95%
confidence interval is 173.04 comma
average height of all men in the city is
173.04
CM and
role that is the independent variable
and sales is what you want to predict by
analyzing the past data regression helps
finding a pattern or relationship for
example you might discover that for
every $100 you spend on Advertising your
sales increase
by100 this means you are positive
relationship between advertising and
sales now if you plan to spend $1 500 on
Advertising You can predict an increase
in the sales by applying that
relationship regression analysis gives
you a formula or model to make such
predictions based on the pattern you
identified in short regression helps you
logically predict how changes in one
factor affect another next I will be
talking about is frequency statistics in
statistics frequency refers to how often
something occurs in a data set it simply
counts how many times each value or
event appears frequency is useful for
for understanding the distribution or
pattern of data let's say you surveyed
10 people about their favorite food and
the results were four people chose
apples three people chose bananas two
people chose oranges and one person
chose grapes let here's how frequency
Works apples have a frequency of four as
four person chose it bananas have a
frequency of three oranges have a
frequency of two and grape has a
frequency of one
in this simple example frequency helps
you see that apples were the most
popular fruit Choice while grapes were
the least popular last but not the least
let's talk about curosis statistics
curosis is a statistical term that
describes the shape of the distribution
of data especially how the data is
concentrated in the tales it helps us
understand if the data has more or fewer
extreme values compared to a normal
distribution it is further divided into
high kosis and low kosis high High kosis
has more extreme values and in low kosis
the data has fewer extreme values in
short high kosis means more extreme
Heights while low kosis means more
consistent evenly spread Heights by now
you be curious to know about the
differences among all the types of
Statistics so here we go differentiating
them on the basis of purpose descriptive
statistics summarizes the main features
of a data set for example mean median
and standard deviation inferential
statistics makes predictions or
generalizations about the population
based on Sample data frequency statistic
counts when specific values or events
occur in the data State curosis
describes the shape of the distribution
focusing on the tales and extreme values
differentiating them on the basis of
data Focus descriptive statistics deals
with the entire data set at hand
inferential statistics uses a sample to
infer conclusions about a larger
population statistics focuses on the
frequency of individual values or
categories cusis focuses on whether the
data has many or few extreme values now
differentiating them on the basis of
common metrics in descriptive statistics
is the mean median mode and standard
deviation and range and in inferential
statistics there hypothesis testing
confidential intervals regression
analysis in statistics there frequency
counts frequency tables histograms bars
and charts in gsis gsis value high kosis
is equal to more extreme values and low
kosis is equal to fewer extremes now
differentiating on the basis of
complexity complexity in descriptive
statistic is simple and straightforward
summarizes the observed data and in
inferential statistics it is more
complex and in statistics it is simple
counting and displaying of occurrences
kosis it is requires statistical
analysis to determine the distribution
tailedness now finally differentiating
them on the basis of visualization
descriptive statistics it is the box
plots pyur and summary tables
inferential statistics it is confidence
intervals regression lines P values and
more and in statistics it is Bard
histograms frequency tables and GTO says
it is histograms distribution plots to
visualize outliers so here is a question
