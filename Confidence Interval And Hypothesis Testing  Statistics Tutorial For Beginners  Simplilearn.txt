hello everyone
welcome to simply learn
maths and statistics for data science
are essential because these topics form
the basic foundation of all the machine
learning algorithms
in fact
mathematics and statistics is behind
everything
from shapes patterns colors and
algorithms
so today we'll discuss two important
topics of statistics that is confidence
interval and hypothesis testing
we'll discuss how to use it when to use
it and the real life application of the
same
but before we begin if you haven't
already subscribed to our channel please
do so so that you never miss an update
let's move forward
estimation and confidence interval
using descriptive and influential
statistics you can make two types of
estimate about the population one is
point estimate and other is interval
estimate
a point estimate is a single value
estimate of a parameter for instance a
sample mean is a point estimate of a
population mean
an interval estimate gives you a range
of values where the parameter is
expected to lie
a confidence interval is the most common
type of interval estimate
both the types of estimate are important
for gathering a clear idea of where a
parameter is likely to lie the
confidence interval is a range of values
it is expressed as a percentage and it
is expected to contain the best estimate
of a statistical parameter
the two most frequently used confidence
interval are 95 percent and 99
a confidence interval of 95 percent mean
that it is 95 percent certain that our
population parameter lies in between
this confidence interval
now what is level of confidence
with respect to estimation problems
alpha refers to the likelihood that a
true population parameter lies outside
the confidence interval the level of
confidence is denoted by 1 minus alpha
and it is usually 90 95 or 99
alpha is usually expressed as a
proportion so if the confidence level is
95 percent then alpha will be equal to 1
minus
0.95 that is 0.05 now let's move on to
discuss what this confidence level means
a 95 confidence interval of the mean is
a range with an upper and lower number
calculated from a sample
because the true population mean is
unknown this range describes the
possible values that a mean could be
if multiple samples are drawn from the
same population and a 95 percent ci
calculated for each sample we would
expect the population mean to be found
within 95 of these confidence intervals
95 percent of the sample means for a
specified sample size will lie within
1.96 standard deviations of the
hypothesis population mean similarly for
99 percent confidence interval 99
percent of the sample means will lie
within the 2.5 standard deviations from
the population mean
now let's see how you can calculate the
interval estimates
the interval estimate can be calculated
by adding and subtracting the margin of
error to the point estimate
it gives us the idea of how close a
point estimate is to the value of
parameter
the general form of the interval
estimate is
x bar plus minus margin of error
to calculate the interval estimate we
have the formula x bar plus minus z
s divided by root n
where x bar is the sample mean z is the
number of standard deviations from the
sample mean s is the standard deviation
and n is the size of the sample
now that we have discussed the interval
estimate and the margin of error let's
understand all this concept with the
help of an example
suppose a student measuring the boiling
temperature of a certain liquid observes
the readings on six different samples of
the liquid
he calculates the sample mean to be
103.4
and if he knows that the standard
deviation of this procedure is 1.2
degrees
we have to calculate the confidence
interval of the population mean at a 95
confidence interval so using this
formula of interval estimate
x bar plus minus z into s by root n
we'll find the confidence interval
here
x bar is one zero three point four and z
value is one point nine six
corresponding to ninety five percent
confidence interval
and standard deviation is one point two
divided by root 6 which is sample size
so calculating we'll get the value to be
102.47 and 104.33
which shows that it is 95 percent
certain that our population parameter
lies between this confidence interval
what is hypothesis testing
hypothesis testing or significance
testing is a method for testing a claim
or hypothesis about a parameter in a
population using data measured in a
sample the purpose of the hypothesis
testing is to check if there is enough
statistical evidence in favor of
hypothesis that we have claimed
now we will move on to the research
question
a research problem is a broad issue that
you would like to address through your
research
it identifies a difficult doubt or area
of concern in the theory or in practice
that requires thought and investigation
research objectives are clear statements
of what you aim to achieve through your
research
there are specific actions that you will
take and act as a milestone that will
help you complete your research a
research question is a specific concern
that you will answer through research it
is derived from a research problem but
is based on a study design
when you narrow down on a research
problem to a specific idea that points
towards a feasible way to investigate or
address the research problems we will
get a research question
now
what you should really take care of is
this slight difference between the
research question and the hypothesis
hypothesis makes prediction about
experimental outcome whereas research
question does not
let's understand with the help of an
example suppose your research question
is how many hours per day a student
spends on a gaming and you want the
answer for that
another recent question may be
do the college students with more study
hours can achieve the higher gpa than
the students who do not put in more
hours for study
these questions can be answered by
framing a hypothesis so let's understand
what a hypothesis is
a hypothesis is a temptative statement
about the relationship between two or
more variables
it is a specific testable predictions
about what you expect to happen in a
study the hypothesis is a prediction but
it involves more than a guess
most of the time a hypothesis begins
with a question which is then explored
through background research
hypothesis translates the research
question into a prediction of expected
outcomes
unless you are creating an explanatory
study a hypothesis should always explain
what to expect to happen
so as in the period side we have framed
the question that how many hours per
student spend on a gaming related to
this question we can create a hypothesis
that students who spend more time on
gaming are socially alienated
so there are some good criteria for a
good hypothesis let's discuss what are
those
a hypothesis should be compatible with
the current knowledge in the area and it
should follow the logical consistency it
should not be inconsistent in places
a good hypothesis must be shaded briefly
and clearly
and it should be testable now we'll
understand what a null hypothesis and
alternative hypothesis is
the null hypothesis is the assumption
that an event will not occur
a null hypothesis has no bearing on the
study's outcome unless it is rejected
h naught is a symbol for null hypothesis
the alternating hypothesis or a research
hypothesis is a logical opposite of the
null hypothesis
the acceptance of the alternating
hypothesis follows the rejection of the
null hypothesis
let's understand the null hypothesis
with the help of an example suppose we
have a research hypothesis that a
duration of an advertisement on the tv
channels is positively related to the
sales of the product
the more the duration the more the sales
of that product
so the null hypothesis of this
assumption would be
the duration of the advertisement on the
tv channels are not related to the sales
of the product they're not related at
all now we'll move on to the test
statistics that i frequently discussed
when creating hypothesis testing
the test statistics is a number
calculated from the statistical test of
a hypothesis it shows how close your
observed data matches the distribution
expected under the null hypothesis of
data statistical test
the distribution of the data is how
often each observation occurs and can be
described by central tendency and
variation around the central tendencies
the test statistics summarizes your
observed data into a single number using
the central tendency variation sample
size and the other number of predictable
variables in your statistical model
there are broadly three capsule
statistical tests
different statistical tests have
slightly different ways of calculating
these test statistics but the underlying
hypothesis and interpretation of the
test statistics stay the same
so the first one is a t-test
a t-test is a statistical test that is
used to compare the means of two groups
it is often used in hypothesis testing
to determine whether a process or
treatment actually has an effect on the
population of interest or whether the
two groups are different from one
another the null hypothesis is that the
true difference between these group
means is zero and the alternative
hypothesis is that the true difference
is different from zero
now let's move on to the test
the tests are statistical way of testing
a hypothesis that either we know the
population variance or we don't know the
population variance but our sample size
is greater than 30. we perform the z
test when we want to compare a sample
mean in the population mean
the next is an f test the f test or the
f statistics is simply a ratio of two
variances
variances is a measure of dispersion or
how far the data are scattered from the
mean larger values represent the greater
dispersion despite being a ratio of
variances you can use a f test in a wide
variety of situation
f test can assess the equality of
variances however by changing the
variances that are included in the ratio
the f test became a very flexible test
now that we have discussed all the
theories related to the hypothesis
testing let's take an example to
understand them more clearly
consider a study on a group of students
whether students receive a special
learning aid to the online videos on
science
it is hypothesized that after viewing
these online videos the group of
students score better than the one who
have not seen the videos
so in this case a research hypothesis
will be students who have received a
special science learning videos will
score high in a science competency test
and its null hypothesis will be the
special science learning videos made no
impact on the scores of the students
now we will discuss what a significance
level is
level of significance or significance
level refers to a criterion of judgment
upon which a decision is made regarding
the values stated in the null hypothesis
this criteria is based on the
probability of obtaining a statistic
measured in a sample if the values
stated in null hypothesis were true
generally the criterion of the level of
significance is typically set at 5
or 0.05
this value of significance level can
also be taken as one percent or 10
depending upon your requirement
if the result obtained from the study
indicates the probability lower than the
significance level so in this case a
researcher can reject null hypothesis
otherwise if the result of the study
indicates the probability higher than
the significance level the researcher
can support the null hypothesis so with
this we have come to an end to this
