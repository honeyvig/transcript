hello everyone
welcome to this tutorial on css advanced
functions by simply learn
in this video we are going to learn some
of the more advanced features that can
be used to optimize your web page and
add some extra features to it
so let's get started so the first
function we are going to discuss is css
sudo class
a css sudo class is a keyword added to a
selector that specifies the special
state of the selected elements
sudo class lets you apply a style to an
element not only in relation to the
content of the documentary but also in
relation to external factors like
history of the navigator the status of
its content or the position of the mouse
like hover which lets you know if the
mouse is over an element or not
so
the first sudo class we are going to
discuss is css hover
this sudo class is used to add a special
effect to an element when our mouse
pointer is over it
let's work an example to understand how
this works
so we are on our sublime text editor and
we have added a standard wallet to it
so first i'll create a box element
we get the div class box
let's save this and see right now what
is the status of our page
so as you can see we have this
simply learn tag and the heading that we
have given and the color changes when
you hover over me
now add a style tag to define the
styling of the box
so
we'll keep the background color of the
box as
pen
keep the width to 300 pixels
and height
to 200 pixels
we'll set the margin to auto
let's keep the font size to 40 pixels so
that we can see the text clearly
and will align the text to the center
just save and go back to the page
now you can see
we have this box with the tag the color
changes when you hover over me
now to add the hoover effect you just
have to mention the class
with semicolon and hover so we'll
mention the class box
with a semicolon and hover
will mention the background color to
which the box will change any over our
mouse
so we will keep the background color to
say a cn color
just save and go back to the page
so if you refresh and when you hover
over it you can see the color changes
so
this is how the pseudo hover class works
the next photo class we are going to
discuss is an active pseudo class
the active sudo class represents an
element that has been activated by the
user either by pointing a device or by a
touchscreen device
let's work on an example to understand
how to use the active class to change
the color of active elements the
possible values could be any color name
in any valid format
so we'll use the same example with some
minor changes
first
let's change this text here
we'll keep it to click here
to see the effects
we keep this part as same and instead of
over here we will use the active pseudo
class so
we type active and we'll keep the
background clear to sean
let's text align this h1 to the center
when you refresh and go back
so
you see here it is click here to see the
effects now
to see the difference now you can see
when we are hovering over it the color
does not change it instead of it when we
click on it the color changes
so
this is how the active hover class works
the next advanced property we are going
to discuss is a css pseudo elements
a css sudo element is a keyword added to
a selector that lets you style a
specific part of the selected element
you can use one sudo class element in a
selector
it must appear after the simple
selectors in the statement
as a rule double column should be used
instead of a single column this
distributions the pseudo classes from
the pseudo element so the first pseudo
element we are going to discuss is the
first letter sudo element this pseudo
element applies tied to the first letter
of the first line of the block level
element
let's work out an example to understand
this better
just delete everything
so let's add some content to the body
and we'll add an h1
which says welcome
to simply learn
and we'll add an h2
which says
this is an example
of first
letter
sudo element
let's add a style tag
we align the text in the body to the
center so we'll use text align
center
let's just give proper spacing here
now to this h1
tag we'll add the first letter sudo so
to add the first letter sudo element
just use the double column and type
first
letter
we'll keep the font family of the first
letter assay lucida
calligraphy
there's a spelling mistake
we will keep the font size to 3
centimeters
we'll keep the color to red
and just add a text shadow
for better animation
so we'll keep the text shadow to 5
pixels
8 pixels
and pixels and color cn
now when you save and go back
just refresh
so this wc is a first letter pseudo
element
as you can see we have chained this
first letter with the proper shadowing
of a cn color and a different font size
so this is how the first letters
pseudo element works the next one we are
going to discuss the before pseudo
element
the before sudo element can be used to
insert some content before the content
of an element
let's work out an example
so just add the standard waller plate
inside the body
let's add
welcome to simply learn
we'll add the text inside the queue tag
the queue tag defines a short quotation
so inside the queue tag
we'll add welcome
closed
and again queue tag
simply learn
now that we have the text inside the
body let's add the styling
so we'll keep the font size to of all
the
text to 30 pixels
this is the all selector we have used
font size 30 pixels
now before the text we are going to add
some symbols so we will use double
column q before
we'll add the content with sun symbol
like this
will keep the color of this
symbol to blue
and we'll use the after sudo class to
add the content
like this
we'll keep this color to red
now that we have everything in place
let's go back to see how it looks
you can see the symbols before and after
our text so this is how the before
studio element works
so the next function we are going to
discuss is css loader
the css loader is an animation that
shows the wizard about the page when it
is loading
it is helpful when a page takes some
seconds to load the page content it is
similar to the buffer sign so let's see
how to create a
loader
so i hope you remember the concept of
the keyframes and animations
if you want to revise the concepts you
can watch the previous videos on the
keyframes and animations from the
playlist
so
let's create the loader
we have the standard wall applied
so inside the body tag
just add the center tag and inside it
will add one h1 which says
welcome to simply learn
we'll add
five div tags with the class a1 a2 a3 a4
and a5
just copy paste it five times
so this is a1 a2
a3 a4
and a5
let's open our style tag
inside our style tag we'll first add
color to our h1
so
let's keep the color
of our h1 to orange
now comes the div tag
so for the div tags
we'll keep the display to block
keep the position to absolute
we set the width and height to 10 pixels
each so width 10 pixels
and height 10 pixels
we'll use the cat function to determine
the left margin so to use the calc
function to add calc
fifty percent
and minus one em
the calc function performs a calculation
to be used as a property value
will keep the border radius to say 1.3
am
em is related to the font size of the
element
1.3 em means 1.3 times the size of the
current font
we'll use the transform origin function
with the value one point three em
and two em
the transfer margin property allows you
to change the position of the
transformed elements
2d transformations can change the x and
y axis
keep the animation
to rotate
i will keep the animation iteration
count
infinite
i will keep the animation duration to 2
seconds
let's save and go back to the page to
see how it looks at this point
so as you can see we have our heading
and
you cannot see it but we have a loader
ready
and we just have to add some keyframes
and animations here
so
let's define
keyframes
with the name of the animation rotate
so at zero percent
we use a transform
function to rotate it to
zero degrees
just copy copy this
at hundred percent when it's complete
it'll rotate to the complete 360 degrees
so here we give the value 360 degrees
now let's design each of the
classes here that we have defined
so
dot a1
the animation delay
will be of 0.1 seconds
so for each of the classes that we have
here we have to define them with a
different color
so that when the loader appears we can
see them clearly with the different
colors so
for this
a1 let's keep the background color to
say san
just copy paste it
so that we don't have to write down code
again and again
three
four and five
let's make changes here
so for the a2
we want it
to appear after 0.2 seconds
with the color pink
let's keep this to 0.3 seconds
the color purple
0.4 seconds
green
0.5 seconds let's color black
we kept the animation delay to so close
like 0.1 seconds point two seconds point
c seconds so that the
loader appears in a complete sync with
each other
so just save the file and refresh and go
back to the page
now you can see this is the loader we
have our heading and
this is like a buffer
and it will show when you have some
content to load
so with this we come to an end of this
