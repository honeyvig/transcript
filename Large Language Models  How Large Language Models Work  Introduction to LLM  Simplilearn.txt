without any further Ado let's get
started so let's start with large
language models and large language
models are Advanced AI systems that are
designed to understand generate and
manipulate human language and they're
trained on v data sets and use deep
learning techniques to predict and
generate text so this enables them to
perform a variety of tasks such as
translation summarization and even
creative writing now we'll delve into
the evolution of these models from the
early forms to the Revolutionary
Transformer models so we'll start from
RNN to Transformers so human see text as
words sentences and paragraphs but for
computers text is just a sequence of
characters initially Rec neural networks
that are rnns were used to help machines
understand text and these models process
one word at a time which sometimes leads
to forgetting earlier parts of the
sequence but there's a game changer
there comes transform former models in
2017 the introduction of the Transformer
model revolutionized this field unlike
RNN Transformers use an attention
mechanism allowing them to consider the
entire sentence or paragraph
simultaneously rather than one word at a
time this approach significantly
improves context understanding so now
we'll see how Transformers work so
Transformers first organize text into
words or subwords and these tokens are
then encoded into numerical
presentations and converted into
embeddings which future capture their
meanings the encoder pre-processes these
embeddings to create a context Vector
that represents the entire input we'll
understand this with the help of an
example so here's an example and the
sentence is as she said this she looked
down at her hands so now first we'll
convert into tokenization the sentence
is broken down into smaller pieces
called tokens as you can see on the
screen we have shifted all the words and
provided into inverted commas now we'll
process with encoding so each of these
tokens is then converted into a
numerical representation think of it as
giving each word a unique number and now
we'll process with embeddings so these
numbers are then turned into vectors
which are multi-dimensional
representations that capture the meaning
of each token for instance the word she
and her might have similar vectors
because they often appear in similar
context now we'll process with context
vector so the encoder pre-processes all
these vectors together to understand the
entire sentence it creates a context
Vector which is like a summary of the
meaning of the whole sentence and at
last we have Auto regressive generation
so using the context Vector the decoder
can start generating new text it might
predict the next word in a sequence
based on the context if it has learned
for example given the context it might
generate the word and next leading to a
continuation of the sentence now let's
break down the Transformer architecture
and understand how all these processes
are coming so this is the diagram for
Transformers and this architecture
comprises an encoder and a decoder each
with multiple layers so starting with
the encoder the first layer is input
embedding so the input text is tokenized
and converted into embeddings that is
Vector representation and after that we
have positional encoding this is the
second layer this adds information about
the position of each token in the
sequence and after that we have multi
head attention that's a layer and it
allows the model to focus on different
parts of the input sequence
simultaneously capturing various aspects
of the input and after that we have ADD
and gome layer so this adds the input of
the previous layer and normalizes the
result and then we have feed forward
layer so this is a fully connected feed
forward Network that pre-processes or
processes the attention outputs and
after that we have again the ADD and
gome layer this adds the input of the
previous layer and normalizes the result
again so this structure is represented n
times that is indicated by NX and now
we'll move to decoder so decoder has the
first layer that is output embedding
this is similar to input embedding but
for the Target sequence and after that
we have positional and coding layer this
adds positional information to the
Target sequence and then we have mask
multi-ad attention this processes the
target sequence while masking future
tokens to prevent the model from looking
ahead and then we have add a norm layer
this adds the input of the previous
layer and normalizes the result then we
have multi-ad attention this attends to
the encoder's output allowing the
decoder to focus on relevant parts of
the input sequence and then we have ADD
and nor layer this adds the input of the
previous layer and normalizes the result
and then we have feed forward layer
another fully connected feed forward
Network and then we have add an Norm
layer this adds the input of the
previous layer and normalizes the result
and at last we have linear and soft next
layer so the final layer that convert
the decoder output into probabilities
predicting the next token in the
sequence so this was all the process
flow and the encoder processes the
entire input sequence creating a set of
encoded representations and the decoder
generates the output sequence step by
step using the encoded input and
previously generated output tokens now
talking about why Transformers can
predict text so there are two mainly
reasons number one is redid dency in
language and the next is entropy and
predictability now talking about the key
Concepts number one is attention
mechanism so it enables a model to weigh
the importance of different tokens in
the input sequence improving context
understanding then we have positional
encoding it helps the model understand
the order of tokens which is crucial for
meaning in language then we have
multi-head tension it improves the
model's ability to capture different
relationships in the data by focusing on
various parts of the sequence
simultaneously this architecture allows
the transform model to handle long
sequences and complex language task
effectively making it a Cornerstone of
modern NLP applications now that we have
understood how Transformers work let's
discuss what makes large language models
so popular and the capabilities so a
large language model is a type of
artificial intelligence algorithm that
uses deep learning techniques and large
data sets to understand summarize
generate and predict new content they
are a subset of generative AI
specifically designed to create text
based content content now talking about
its historical context so language is
crucial for communication but in AI
language models serve to communicate and
generate Concepts one of the earliest AI
language models are Alisa that debuted
in 1966 and then we have modern llms
like GB3 and Megaton Turing nlg 530b
that are vastly expand on this idea of
billions of parameters allowing them to
understand and generate text more
effectively now we'll see the examples
number one as we have discussed that is
gbd3 that is released by open AI in June
2020 and this model has 175 billion
parameters and can generate taxt and
code from short prompts it's highly
versatile and can perform a wide range
of language task and after that we have
Megatron Touring nlg 530b that is
developed by Nvidia and Microsoft and
this model boast 530 billion parameters
and it excels in reading comprehension
and natural language INF frence making
it one of the most powerful L&M to date
so now we explore the various
capabilities of these large language
models and how they are utilized so
starting with the capabilities so the
capabilities start with generation so
they can create stories marketing
content and more for instance gbd3 can
write a coherent article or generate
creative writing pieces then we have
summarization so condensing legal
documents meeting notes or any lengthy
text into concise summaries this is
particularly useful in legal and
corporate settings and then we have
translation as a capability
so converting text from one language to
another or even translating text into
code this makes llms invaluable in
Global Communication and software
development now we'll move to
classification it can analyze text to
determine sentiment classify topics or
identify toxic language this can help in
moderating online content and
understanding customer feedback and
after that we have another capability
that is chat boards so building virtual
assistant and Q&A systems that can
interact with users in a human like
manner that provides customer support or
general information so these were all
the capabilities now we look at some
real world applications of llms across
various Industries and we'll start with
Healthcare so llms are used to predict
protein structures uncover disease
patterns and analyze medical text and
patient records this can lead to
breakthroughs in medical research and
personalized Healthcare then we have
retail as real world application it can
enhance customer service through dynamic
boards that can handle inquiries provide
recommendations and improve the shopping
experience and then we have real world
application in software development and
after that we have software development
so llms assist developers in writing
code debugging anyone teaching robots to
perform physical task and then we have
Finance as dual World application so
llms can summarize earning calls
creating meeting transcript and
analyzing financial documents to provide
insights and support decision making and
then we have marketing as real world
application it's can organize customer
feedback segmenting products and
generating compelling marketing content
now that we have seen the applications
let's understand how large language
models work and the learning techniques
they use so large language model work
with training with unsupervised learning
so llms are trained using unsupervised
learning which means they learn from
large data sets without label data they
find patterns and relationships in the
data enabling them to perform various
tasks like text generation summarization
and translation and there are three
types of learning learning for the llms
and you'll see number one is zero short
learning so zero short learning llms can
perform task they were not specifically
trained for and thanks to the extensive
training data for this and then we have
one short learning so they can learn
from a single example to improve their
performance on a specific task then we
have few short learning so learning from
a few examples enhancing their ability
to generalize and perform task
accurately and then we have
customization techniques for lnms number
one custom ation technique is prompt
tuning so adjusting the prompts or
instructions given to the model to guide
its response more effectively and number
second is finetuning so retraining the
model on specific data sets to improve
its accuracy for certain task then we
have adapters so adding smaller Network
to the model allowing it to adapt to
specific task without needing to retrain
the entire model that's the adapters and
the customization technique for llms now
we'll move to the types of large
language models and number one type is
encoded only models so these models are
excellent for understanding task such as
classification and sentiment analysis an
example is bird that is bir directional
and coder representations from
Transformers now moving to second type
of large language model that is decoder
only models so these models are great at
generating text such as writing stories
or articles an example is gbd3 that is
generative pre-trained Transformer 3 and
then we have third type of large
language model that is encoder decoder
model these models combine understanding
and generation making them ideal for
task like translation and summarization
an example is T5 that is textto text
transfer Transformer now we'll move to
advantages and challenges of large
language models so starting with
advantages number one is extensibility
so llm serve as a foundation for various
customized use cases allowing for
adaption to numerous tasks then comes
flexibility llms apply across diverse
task and deployments from chat boards to
content creation and then we have
performance so llms provide high speed
low latency responses making them
efficient and responsive and the
accuracy so there's improved accuracy
with more parameters and larger training
data set and the ease of training it
utilizes label data which accelerates
the training process and then comes
efficiency so llms automate routine task
saving time and resources and now coming
to challenges so number one challenge is
development cost so it requires
significant investment in hardware and
large data sets and then comes
operational cost so high ongoing
expenses for running and maintaining
llms then there comes bias so it's
potential for inheriting biases present
in the training data then comes ethical
concerns there are issues around data
privacy and generating harmful content
then comes explainability so there's a
difficulty in explaining how the models
generate the results and then there's
the last challenge that is hallucination
so there's a risk of generating
inaccurate or nonsensical responses from
the llms now talking about the future of
large language models the future of llms
is very promising with continuous
improvements in accuracy efficiency and
applications businesses will
increasingly leverage llms for various
tasks enhancing productivity and
Innovation so in conclusion so large
language models are transforming the AI
landscape by understanding and
generating humanik text while they come
with challenges their potential to
revolutionize various Industries is
immense so stay tuned for more a
