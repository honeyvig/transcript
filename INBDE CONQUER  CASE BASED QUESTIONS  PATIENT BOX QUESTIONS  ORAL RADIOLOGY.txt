hello everyone
this is dr pratyusha chava from team
inbd conquer
so today we'll be basically discussing
about patient boxes now what are patient
boxes dr sythi must have given you an
update about what patient boxes are
we have so many subjects right in
dentistry
so in each with respect to each subject
they present case scenarios to you in
the form of a box
now what will that box have that box
will have basic demographic data of the
patient the name age of the patient okay
sex of the patient right what is the
chief complaint and what is the
background history and what are the
presenting features
sometimes along with all these they
might or might not give you a clinical
picture of the patient
so you have to read the patient box
completely try to understand the
information given by them then if a
picture is given you have to look at the
picture
then try to analyze after that based on
that patient box they will give you a
question
and that question will have four options
among the options you have to select
which is the correct one
so doctor said he must have already
presented about 20 odd cases in a
previous presentation i will be
continuing the subject i will be dealing
with this oral medicine oral radiology
and oral pathology together i have
combined all these three together so
that you have an idea of the
histological as well as the radiological
presentation of a certain disease if it
is given to you so today myself i will
be discussing ten such questions with
you okay so let us start this
interesting discussion
one thing i will tell you is please when
i am giving putting forward the case if
i say case one and i give you the
patient box you don't wait for me to
give you the answer you analyze and come
to a conclusion as to what this case
could be then it will be easy for you
also then you and me both of us together
will discuss the
case and we'll discuss the important
points related to that disease
okay so be energetic throughout the
video and please concentrate let us
start
a 20
i'm sorry yeah
a 20 year old male patient so the
patient data says patient is 20 year old
male right
chief complaint what is the chief
complaint presence with a
please
be very attentive painless swelling
of the right maxilla so here the right
maxilla and the frontal bone as well
of the right maxilla and the frontal
bone of the left side here can you see
this
okay so the right maxilla is enlarged
and the left side of the frontal bone
and left side of the face has been
enlarged
okay for the past two years
right
so background history he has been
hospitalized multiple times for broken
bones so here only you should be
understanding so that that is something
related to a bone pathology
right
then the clinical findings says that
the patient presented with facial
asymmetry it is very evident extra oral
examination revealed well-defined bony
heart swelling of the right maxillary
region right there was also involvement
of the left frontal bone which showed
prominence as it is very clear in the
clinical picture
intraorally also there is enlargement of
the right side of the palate
right can you see here intraorally can
you see this huge expansion right
and there is also extension
medial actually how the buccal alveolar
plate
is extended can you see this bony heart
spelling is causing extension towards
the buccal side as well
from one seven one one two one seven
from here till here as i mark the extent
of the lesion
alkaline phosphatase was raised to 300
units per liter
increased alp
so we know it's a bony pathology we know
there is increased alp and we know that
multiple bones are involved and it is
causing swelling now if you got the
answer keep the answer with you let us
let me pose the question now question
what is the radiographic feature you can
find in this patient
a the lesions are usually radiolucent
well circumscribed and may have a cotton
wool appearance
b
lesions are usually saucer shaped
radiolucency
see lesions are usually radiopic not
well circumscribed and may have a ground
glass appearance
d the lesions are usually well
demarcated unilocular or multilocular
radiolucencies
now what is the answer bony pathology
causing extensive expansion of the jaws
and the other involved bones like
frontal bone causing facial asymmetry
with increased alkaline phosphatase
causing buccal expansion of the cortex
you all are right
everybody i think would have guessed it
by now it is fibrous dysplasia
now when you have guested that it is
fibrous dysplasia what should be the
answer what is the radiographic
presentation of fibrous dysplasia
ultimately your answer goes to answer c
okay so it the lesions may be radio
opaque from reducing to radio opaque
usually it varies and it can be ah usual
presentation is that of a ground glass
appearance now what are what how does
fibrous displacement occur fibrils
displacer is basically when a connective
tissue will
replace the medullary bone okay there is
formation of extensive collagen okay and
usually it is because of mutations of
gnas one gene
right and what are the forms we have
monostatic right
mono polyostatic
right and craniofacial form
right monoostatic is the most common
form it is around 85 percent you see
monoostatic form right usually presence
in puberty and males are more affected
than
sorry females are more affected than
males and usually this monostatic
fibrous dysplasia is seen in the
maxillary region as we saw our patient
also had expansion of the right maxilla
right and polyostatic as the name
suggests apart from jaws
other parts of the body bones are also
involved where you see pathological
fractures because the osteoid material
of the bone is replaced by connective
tissue that is the reason why there is
an increase in alkaline phosphatase
serum alkaline phosphatase so this
poliostatic fibrous dysplasia is
associated with multiple pathological
factor factors in our case in the
background history the patient had gone
frequently to the hospital because of
multiple fractures of the bones so that
also is an additive uh feature how you
diagnose fibrous dysplasia right and
also apart from increased alkaline
phosphatase please remember you also see
hypophosphatemia
okay hypophosphatemia is also seen
in uh
fibrous dysplasia now one craniofacial
fibrous dysplasia is again associated
with the skull as well right so uh what
are the syndromes associated one more
thing they can ask you is what are the
possible syndromes that you can see with
the fibrous dysplasia so first thing
that has to go into your mind is make
you an albright syndrome
okay mccune albright syndrome where you
see fibrous disease dysplasia associated
with
pigmentations all throughout the body
now those pigmentations what are they
called they are called as caffeiol
pigmentations right
caffeiol pigmentations make you albright
syndrome and also this
polyostatic fibrous dysplasia with the
caffeine pigmentation and certain
endocrine abnormalities also you can see
in mecune albright syndrome right so
it's fibrous dysplasia
endocrine abnormalities right and what
is the other type of syndrome jeffy
lichenstein syndrome
right
jeffy lichtstein since syndrome
in this also you see multiple bony
lesions with caffeine pigmentation so
please remember these two uh syndromes
make you an albright syndrome and
jeffrey lichtenstein syndrome so
radiological feature as i told you it's
ground glass appearance where you see
that the bony trabeculae are displaced
are resolved and connective tissue is
formed that is the reason why you get
that dot dot dot dot dot appearance can
anybody tell me what is this appearance
also called as apart from the ground
ground glass
yes you are right it's called as po the
orange okay
so this also they can give you for the
orange appearance like the appearance of
an orange skin peel you see multiple
pores will be present on the orange skin
so that is how it's called as pure the
orange
appearance okay and one more thing i
want to tell you radiological feature
there is something called as rind sign
ri nd sign
okay ring sign is nothing but when this
bone is undergoing resorption centrally
you see radiolucency and periphery
peripherally it is surrounded by a radio
opaque margin okay so this thick sly
rotating margin with central
radiolucency will give the appearance of
a rinse sign so you see rinse sign you
see ground glass and also you see per
day orange appearance radiographically
okay
and also one more syndrome that i forgot
to mention is major broad syndrome maser
broad syndrome is nothing but
intramuscular mixomas associated with
fibrous dysplasia
okay so you have fibrous dysplasia with
intramuscular mixoma so you have mecun
albright you have master broads and you
have jeffy lichtenstein syndrome okay
three syndromes three types of
radiological presentations ground glass
body orange or
you have rin sign also and also because
of this extensive expansion of the
facial bones it gives a leonine feces
okay leo nine appearance like a lion
that is why it is called as leontiasis
ossia where do you see leon diaz's
aussie appearance you see in fibrous
dysplasia so i hope this case one
patient box if they give you this these
all can be possibilities also of
questions okay
in instead of asking this question they
can ask you okay if they give you uh
like for the orange appearance or if
they give you ring sign you should be
able to answer or if they reframe the
question and they give you apart from
serum uh alkaline phosphatase increase
what is the other thing you see you see
hypophosphatemia so like this you should
be able to answer i hope fibrous
dysplasia is clear to you let's go to
the next question
case two please be attentive listen to
me listen to this i think you can
diagnose it it is it is a relatively
easy one okay 52 year old male right
chief complain swelling on right side of
okay can you see this filling
swelling on right side of palette for
the past five years so it is a long
duration right
i usually do this whenever i'm reading
or analyzing a case is case based
question i underline important things
and think okay long duration acute
chronic pain associated symptomatic
symptom less so like that you have to
think it it makes in uh narrowing down
your diagnosis okay so you can exclude
you can follow that exclusion principle
and based on that you can narrow your
diagnosis right so let us see the
background history of the patient the
patient had undergone surgical treatment
for a bony swelling at lower border of
the mandible for about 30 years back
so 30 years back he underwent some
surgery at the lower border of the
mandible he had a bony swelling so these
bony swellings are not unusual first it
was in mandible then now he is
presenting with maxilla okay past
medical history revealed chronic bowel
upset
in the form of abdominal cramps and
diarrhea so now you know that systemic
involvement is there multiple systems
are involved it is not only
confined to oral cavity we have some
problem with the intestine or g
gastrointestinal system as well next
family history revealed that now we are
coming we family history when it says
that we come to a conclusion that it
could be genetic also right so family
history revealed that both sons of the
patient had bony spellings of the job
so
we came to know it's a chronic thing
okay
systems are involved and also it is
familiar okay so this is how you narrow
next let us see the clinical findings on
examination multiple small nodular
spellings were seen on the forehead
okay
nodular swellings were seen on the
forehead so if we see now we had gi also
we have skin involvement also here right
intra oral examination revealed
spellings on right and left side of the
palette panoramic radiograph was
obtained this is the opg of the patient
if you can see
it revealed multiple impacted teeth okay
with respect to so many things okay and
you can also see that is the density of
the mandible and maxilla is it normal no
you can see multiple radio opacities
here all throughout the mandible can you
see the radio opacities so you have
multiple impacted teeth with multiple
radio opaque lesions all throughout
maxilla and mandible
gi there is some problem with the gi
okay abdominal cramps diarrhea is there
on the skin also you can see small
nodular spellings okay okay
let's come
what is the most serious complication he
should be concerned with
when consulting his physician
a odentomas
b osteomas
c epidermoid cyst b multiple polyps that
affect the large intestine now what is
your answer it is a syndrome what is
that syndrome it is guard nerd syndrome
gardener syndrome
now gardner syndrome is a very very very
very important
syndrome this is probably the first
syndrome that i learned when i was
preparing for my post graduation
because this syndrome is so important
that they can ask you questions in any
form okay they can ask you based on
presentations okay which are the
components of sin gardner syndrome like
a case a case presentation like how i
have given here okay they can ask you
many things now what is that that we
have to be concerned as a dental uh
physician what is that about gardner
syndrome that we should take care when
we are referring that patient it is
d multiple polyposes because
almost hundred percent of
intestinal polyps can cause colorectal
adenocarcinoma
okay
adreno carcinoma very very very very
important this is a pre-cancerous stage
okay which can lead to colorectal
adrenal carcinoma that is why we as
dental physicians should be careful if
we can get a case of gardner syndrome in
our dental office we have to refer the
patient for follow-up visits to a
gastroenterologist now what are the
components of gardner syndrome i
launched it by a small mnemonic called
as dop c
d stands for desmoid tumors
okay o stands for osteomas
p stands for polyposis of intestine
s stands for sebaceous cysts
and i stands for multiple impacted
supernumerary teeth
okay impacted
supernumerary teeth very very important
please take it
as a sure short question okay
so this is very important garner
syndrome you should know in and out okay
so this polyposis of intestine is very
important because of its potential to
transform into malignancy okay apart
from that also in females
around 100 fold
risk is there for thyroid carcinoma
okay thyroid carcinoma
right and one more thing can i ask you
this presentation of multiple impacted
supernumerary teeth where do you see
other than gardeners you also see in
kedo-cranial dysplasia
okay
so these are your important takeaway
points from this case presentation so
far so clear now let us go to the
next case case three
okay
so please pay attention 13 year old boy
patient data right chief complaint is
spelling in relation to right cheek
again
right that gradually increased in size
over a period of two months
okay so short duration relatively not
that long right
he has seen a neurologist and reveals he
has some calcified structures in the
brain
so people who looking at the case uh
pictures and looking at this if you have
come to our diagnosis just hold on okay
clinical findings thorough general
examination revealed relative
macrocephaly
okay with hypertalorism
okay hypertelorism was seen
palmar and plantar pits can you see the
pits here
on the hand and on the legs so palmar
and plantar pitting was see
radiography of the skull was taken which
revealed macrocephaly
and also
cervical thoracic spine extra lumbar
spine x-ray was taken it revealed bifid
rip
okay
my feet drip spina bifida right and also
scoliosis some vertebral anomaly
scoliosis x-ray is not with us we can
just see the bifid rib here in this
x-ray okay
and
panoramic radiograph revealed three
well-defined radiolucencies with the
slerotic borders
i am not sure if we are able to
appreciate here here okay and here the
radiolucences are here
okay clear with the case so we have seen
that there is some phase anomaly on
skeletal aluminium in the form of
expansion of the maxilla right
anterior maxilla posterior both
mandibles huge regulation seeds are seen
and palmar plantar paintings are seen
also he's saying that he has some
calcified structure in the brain and
with the rib you see spina bifida
and at the back in the vertebral column
you see scoliosis right
yes the panoramic radiograph may rightly
reveal now what are these radiolucencies
that you are seeing diagnose them is it
an osteoma
be
keratocystic orangogenic tumor c
odentoma or d denteger is cyst now give
me the diagnosis what is the diagnosis
yes it is knee void basal cell
carcinoma syndrome also called as
garland gall syndrome
okay again very very important very very
important garland gault syndrome nevoid
basal cell carcinoma syndrome it also
indicates
that apart from
dental anomalies like okay so what is
the answer what is the dental anomaly
that you see in void basal cell
carcinoma syndrome yes you all are right
it is
kot keratosistic odentogenic
so those huge radiolucences that you are
seeing are kots now what are the things
that comprise of nemoid basal cell
carcinoma syndrome how do you diagnose
garlic or syndrome there are certain
criteria major and minor criteria so in
major criteria
major and minor
okay
so usually to diagnose they should be
two major criteria or a combination of
one major criteria plus two minor
criteria please remember this ok so in
major criteria you should have more than
two basal cell carcinomas
then you should have okc's
then palma plantar pitting
okay palmer plantar pitting
there should be more than three
pits followed by hyperkeratosis okay
then calcification of fox cerebri as he
already mentioned brain calcification
okay that should be present right
bifid rib
right so these ore our major criteria
now what are the other minor criteria as
we can see you see macrocephaly we we
have microcephaly in our patient right
frontal bossing
frontal passing
okay
hypertelorism
hypertylerism
ok
and sometimes syndactyly also
okay so these are all our components of
new world basal cell carcinoma syndrome
why are we alternate is very concerned
with the syndrome because we can see
multiple keratosistic organogenic tumors
that are present in the jaws okay so we
have to be concerned okay sometimes this
patient can also have congenital
blindness as well
right so radiographically you see bifid
rips okay you can see syndactyly you can
diagnose macrocephaly you can diagnose
calcification of fox cerebri okay and
also they have vertebral anomalies in
the form of scoliosis
okay
which our patient had so almost this
case is presented in such a way that
almost many of these major and minor
criterias are covered
okay clear about nemoid basal cell
carcinoma syndrome also called as
garland gall syndrome
okay let's go to the next one
right case 4
55 year old woman
okay
swelling of the left side of the face
since two years
okay
and pain while chewing food since three
months
this is the only thing he gives so since
two years if it is of a chronic duration
definitely it must have been a painless
swelling that is why she didn't bother
to come to the dentist so this is how
you should analyze right
background history patient had altered
sensation paresthesia
okay
paresthesia
over the left cheek region
she was also habit history also was
there
now when i say habit don't jump into the
conclusion that it is squamous cell
carcinoma look at the mucosa mucosa is
very very normal here coming to that now
habit always does not indicate that you
can see something related to that like
leukoplakia hydroplakia or oral squamous
cell carcinoma it is not that okay just
see the findings and look at the picture
then think about it clinical findings
on examination there was a solitary
ill-defined diffuse spelling over the
left middle and lower third of the face
which you can see
intra-oral examination revealed
ill-defined solitary swelling in the
left lower posterior buccal vestibule
with the smooth surface there was no
ulceration there there was no varuka's
appearance okay that means he's
indirectly telling you that
dear it is not
cancer right
so with a smooth surface and mucosa was
stretched similar to adjacent mucosal
color with no secondary changes
whatsoever
it was non tender hard in consistency
okay heart inconsistency think that bone
is involved think about it okay with
buccal and lingual plate expansion very
clear bony swelling mucosa is not
involved something is happening in the
bone which is causing that swelling
3 7 3 8 are missing okay can you see
only 3 6 is present 3 7 3 8 are not
there
now what is the most likely radiographic
presentation in this case scenario
do you see a cotton wool
do you see a podi orange do you see a
soap bubble appearance or do you see a
ground glass appearance can you diagnose
this
don't think
can you diagnose i think you must be
thinking somewhere missing t directly
jump into dentistry cyst okay look at
the patient
analyze
okay i can i can uh uh if you are
thinking about dentist and can you think
of another one which could be possibly
mandibular rama spelling most common
common mandibular rama swelling in that
age patient what is the diagnosis that
you can think of
okay it is
ameloblastoma okay amyloblastoma
you people can get confused with
amiloblastoma and denture resist also
but then you have to consider other
factors as well so this case is a case
of ameloblastoma right and what is the
appearance so bubble appearance right
usually in third and seventh decade of
life amyloblastoma presence okay and it
is a painless slow growing swelling as
we all know because it is present in
since a long time so it is the most
common odentogenic tumor in
with relation to mandibular ramus area
please remember this very very important
okay which causes bucco lingual
expansion as we saw in our case so you
have what are the types you have you
have
multicystic
unisystic
ok
and extra oscis
multistick is usually 85 percent
unicystic is 15 percent and extra
ostrich is around one percent okay so
these types basically you should
remember okay what is the radiological
presentation you see a multi-locular
appearance okay
multi-locular radiolucency
in the form of soap bubble
okay
or
honeycomb
okay if either of these are given it
will be your answer so bubble or
honeycomb appearance okay and malignant
usually this amyloblastoma has very
rarely but it can transform into
malignancy when such malignancy is
present you can see that malignant
amyloblastoma is spreading to lungs also
this is also very important what is the
most common organ in which you can see
malignant amyloblastoma your answer
should be lungs okay so it is the second
most common orientogenic tumor the first
being odentoma followed by odentoma
second most common is amiloblastoma
right and histologically also there are
various types what are the various types
histologically you see follicular you
see granular acanthomatous
okay basal cell desmoplastic and
flexiform ameloblastoma okay so
histologically also the various variants
you should be aware of okay how
does a amyloblastoma appear
radiologically you see a multi-ocular
radiolucency with a honeycomb or a soap
bubble appearance
okay so clear about
ameloblastoma right let's go to the next
case next patient box
okay
case five okay
77 year old woman
okay chief complaint is complaints of
dysphagia vomiting shortness of breath
and weight loss for one month
right background history there is
nothing significant about the background
history
clinical findings physical examination
revealed conjunctival power
shaped nails right
angular kilitis and smooth tongue so
based on all this you definitely must be
thinking it is some kind of anemia you
are right it is some kind of anemia
now apart from that they also did the
gastrointestinal endoscopy can you see
here
endoscopy picture it revealed
that there is a web here
yes gi endoscopy said that there is a
web okay
here also they also did a barium swallow
followed by that both detected webs okay
in the upper portion of esophagus
okay i think you must have diagnosed it
by now
what disease does she have
aplastic anemia
plummer vinson syndrome
punishes anemia cushing's syndrome yes
you all are right it is plummer vincent
syndrome what are the components of
promovinson syndrome you have iron
deficiency anemia
okay you have colonical
you have atrophy of
buccal mucosa tongue right
and you also have dysphagia
which by which our patient had so our
patient had everything in this
okay so it helps us in clearly
diagnosing that it is a clear cut case
of plummer vincent syndrome what are the
other names of plummer vinson syndrome
it is also called as paterson
brown
kelly syndrome
okay
so apart from this iron deficiency
anemia you see esophageal web formation
okay which causes the dysphasia so it is
very difficult for patient to take in
that
take in food because of dysphagia and
also there will be excessive burning
sensation because of loss of papillae
atrophy of the tongue which causes
weight loss ultimately nutrition of the
patient is compromised because of
decreased food intake that is why weight
loss also you can see which a patient
had so like this you have to think about
all the symptoms that are presented in
the case box and then come to a
conclusion so ah
dysphagia was there iron deficiency was
that atrophy was there okay all this was
a component of plummer vinson syndrome
also also you can see parasthesias at
the later stage
okay and the tongue is called as a
beefy red tongue okay please remember
this beefy red and bald tongue the
tongue appearance okay it is also called
as hunter's glossitis or moeller's
glottal glossitis that inflammation of
the tongue is called as hunters
glossitis or molars glossitis and in the
blood in the spirit what do you see you
see whole
whole jolly bodies
okay
cabbage rings
okay and apart from a decreased iron you
can see increase in bilirubin
and lactate dehydrogenase
okay these are the other components so
questions can be
framed on these also that is the reason
i am asking you okay that is the reason
i am telling you all these points also
so if they instead of that if they frame
what is the uh typical uh presentation
in the blood smear if a if if taken from
this patient so you should go for hobel
jolie bodies cabbage rings okay
all this right clear about this plummer
vinson syndrome let's go to the next one
next case case number six
right 55 year old male patient
right he complains of swelling in the
right corner of the lip region can you
see this this is the corner of the lip
there is some swelling in the oral
cavity
background
history the lesion was first noticed
four months ago
which increased in size gradually
any history of dental or facial trauma
was not reported
right
the lesion was found to be painless
except on digital pressure
now what are the clinical findings
lesion was about four into five
centimeter in size it was pink in color
at the corner of the mouth okay
it was firm and sessile
no stock form and cesar these two are
very important right
radiograph of that area revealed no bony
involvement
right
the lesion was firm in consistency cell
as i told you connective tissue contain
numerous blood vessels
which surrounded by plump vibrating
proliferating
endothelial cells okay and there is a
dense chronic inflammatory cells like
lymphocyte plasma cells macrophages are
present in the connective tissue it's a
very simple case
your diagnosis
name the most frequently and name this
most frequently encountered intraoral
benign neoplasm of connective tissue
origin is it a leomyosarcoma is it a
fibroma is it a leomyoma or a
rhabdomyoma your answer is fibroma
corner of the lip all of us many of us
have that habit of
what you do you cheek biting very common
no so because of that constant
irritation because of that
pressure from the occlusal forces there
will be formation of fibrous tissue in
the form of a spelling okay firm fibrous
swelling so usually it is cecile in some
cases very rare cases it can be
pedicular pedunculated also so it is the
most common benign tumor that you can
see most common tumor in oral cavity is
fibroma and it is benign
okay
it's also called as irritation fibroma
traumatic fibroma or focal fibrous
hyperplasia no matter what name you call
it by it is the most common tumor
secondary to that constant irritating
force that you see because of excessive
occlusal forces on the cheek because of
the cheek biting ok so
histopathologically as we see we see
huge number of fibrocytes ok
ok so collagen fibers also can be seen
right
and also there will be ready plaque
flattening okay
flattening
this can be seen so clear with this case
fibromya it's a relatively simple case
so you should be able to you should be
in a position to be able to diagnose if
they give you this
let's go to case number seven okay uh
old gentleman right 65 year old patient
complaining of inability to open mouth
pain and difficulty in swallowing with
the swelling in relation to lower jaw as
well as the neck
for the past four days so it means it is
acute so mostly i will think of an
infection
right i will go my brain will go in that
direction infectious okay
then background history an infected
third molar had been extracted three
days earlier so there was some procedure
that was done three days ago okay
followed by which he developed some huge
swelling which is causing difficulty in
opening mouth eating okay and severe
pain okay at the presentation clinically
patient had fever of 100 degree
fahrenheit pulse of 80 beats per minute
blood pressure was 100 by 70 respiratory
rate was 22 per
minute so it increased respiration right
mouth opening was limited to 1.5
centimeter so decreased mouth opening
extra oral swelling was indurated and
non-fluctuant with involvement of
submandibular and sublingual region
okay can you see the ceiling here also
it went from here till the neck region
true statement about the severe
spreading infection is
it involves submental and sublingual
spaces only
it involves submandibular submental
sublingual spaces unilaterally
involves submandibular and sublingual
spaces only
involves submandibular submental and
sublingual spaces bilaterally your
answer is d and all of you are correct i
think you must have guessed it by now it
is ludwigs and now okay
save your board like spelling of the
mouth causing difficulty in breathing
okay because of epiglottal edema
okay the infection goes and spreads to
the epic lotus causing that difficulty
in opening mouth okay epic glottal edema
is a very serious complication and also
another serious complication is
cavernous sinus thrombosis which can
occur okay so this can compromise the
airway of the patient that is the reason
why we have to be very very careful when
we treat a case of ludwig's angina so it
is usually rapid in outside and it
involves bilaterally both the sublingual
submental as well as the submandibular
spaces that is the reason it spreads to
the neck it is a huge indurated swelling
okay intuited spelling and it does not
compress there is no compressibility
there is no reducibility and when you
feel the skin on the temperature skin of
the
swelling also you can feel it warm why
because of the inflammation there will
be increased temperature that is the
reason why you can see that high the
skin also will give that pinkish
appearance okay pinkish appearance
temperature will be high huge board like
swelling can be seen
okay and typically the patient will have
that open mouth appearance okay they can
ask you this also where do you see this
open-mouthed appearance in which
infection it is ludwig's and china okay
so there'll be elevation of the tongue
also drooling from the sides right
christmas can be seen fever dysphagia
dyspnea tachycardia right glottal edema
epiglottis edema right and what do you
see you first you have to ah secure the
airway of the patient followed by that
you can do an incision drainage and put
the patient on antibiotics so this is
very very very very important space
infection with relation to dentistry
okay please be very attentive right so
ludwig's antenna can be one of your
question
coming to case number eight
tired please don't be because all these
cases are going to help you in your inbd
preparation okay
please be attentive we have
eight nine ten three more cases to go
right case number eight
81 year old male
okay
he complains of increased volume in the
mandibular symphysis region can you see
this
which had evolved over the period of
seven months again something chronic
something bony okay
chronic lesion
there was no significant background
history
clinical finding suggested that the
swelling was hard in consistency with no
alteration in the local cutaneous tissue
and patient complained of paresthesia of
the lower lip
the lateral panoramic radiograph of the
skull showed an extensive or the lateral
radiographic skull
showed osteolytic lesions in the skull
and also the panoramic radiograph showed
multiple punched out radiolucencies
ill-defined punched out radiolucencies
can you see throughout the border of the
mandible histological analysis revealed
plasma cytoid cells
with round eccentric nuclei
fine granular chromatin and evident
nucleolus
so we know that it is something related
to plasma cell right
plasma cell disorder when we know that
it is something related to plasma cell
causing punched punched out bony
radiolucencies okay and also causing a
huge bony swelling okay what can we
think an elderly patient you will refer
this patient to the physician suspecting
of what disease is it non-hodgkin's
lymphoma hodgkin's lymphoma multiple
myeloma langerhans cell histiocytosis
so what is your answer plasma cell
directly close your eyes go for multiple
myeloma
multiple myeloma is the plasma cell
tumor
right plasma cell tumor usually you see
in african american patients okay most
commonly and males are most commonly
affected than females usually in 60 to
70 years of age
okay in jaws are usually affected in 30
percent of cases
okay usually in posterior mandible but
our patient had anterior mandibular
swelling right and this punched out
lucencies is the pathognomic appearance
punched out radio lucencies right and
also there is one more very peculiar
diagnostic feature that means if i say
that see this is present you can say
ma'am it's multiple myeloma what is that
yes you are right in urine you see
something what do you see ben's jones
proteins right ben stones proteins
okay also you can see monoclonal
monoclonal gamma pathy
okay m spike it is main spike monoglonal
gamma pattern
okay
intraorally one more important thing i
want to tell you is
you can see in amyloidosis also in in
tongue
and oral mucosa okay please remember
this is one additive point that i am
telling you amyloid deposition also can
occur as a part of your plasma
plasma cell tumors like
so i like a multiple myeloma
okay clear about multiple myeloma
let's go to the next question case
number nine oh huge lesion on the tongue
right
26 year old female patient
main complaint
is there is a tongue lesion i have a
huge tongue lesion so she has come
so background is three she has been
smoking
for eight years two to three cigarettes
per day but does not consume alcohol
there is no weight chain weight loss or
night sweats are not there so basically
the doctor asked to rule out your
hodgkin's lymphoma right
so that is also ruled out that is not
there right clinical findings give that
there is a 15 into 20 to 15 millimeter
lesion ok which is exophytic okay with a
central ulcer appearing to infiltrate
the tongue musculature right
oral mucosa also showed some signs of
leukoedema
okay
there was no limitation of mouth opening
and normal dentition was apparent now
here i am presenting that huge exophytic
lesion on the tongue associated with the
habit history so what should you think
of very good i think everybody will
think of squamous cell carcinoma because
it is the single most common causative
etiol causative thing when an etiology
like smoking or beetle nut showing is
present if you have any etiologies like
that
and you see a huge exophytic ulcer in
the oral cavity you have to first and
only think of squamous cell carcinoma so
what is the most likely diagnosis is it
adenoid cystic carcinoma muco epidermoid
carcinoma basal cell carcinoma squamous
cell carcinoma your answer is squamous
cell carcinoma so squamous cell
carcinoma is the most common type of
oral cancer around 90 percent of cases
you see oral cancer is squamous cell
carcinoma males are commonly affected
than females and lower lip is the
most common site actually
okay
and the site if if that parmesal
carcinoma is present in a particular
site which has least favorable prognosis
that is floor of the mouth
floor of the mouth has
least prognosis
okay please remember this because these
are also very very important points okay
lower lip is the most common side it is
the most common tumor okay of oral
cavity right and
one more thing is uh floor of the mouth
has least favorable prognosis right
you can also see like in this patient
usually did not have any pre-cancerous
presentation in the form of leukoplakia
or erythroplakia but you can see those
also developing usually it progresses
from a leukoplakia to a cancer but this
patient we did not get to see any such
appearance of leukoplakia but please
look out for leukoplakia also if such a
case is given to you paresthesias are
also seen so apart from tobacco
also certain viruses like hpv 16 and 18
can cause
oral squamous cell carcinoma
right so this is very very important and
very easy to diagnose when they give you
a condition like this it is definitely
going to be oral spam a cell carcinoma
so clear about that case
so today this is the last case for this
presentation we have come to the end
okay so let us score a 6 with this also
it's case number 10
right a very simple case i put at the
end 58 year old caucasian female okay
complains of acute pain burning and
mastication and feeding difficulties
right she is a heavy smoker
and clinically when you see you saw you
see inter-crossed streaks of web-like
aspect they found on the buccal mucosa
okay typical of we can't striate ah
victims
has told me so where you can see
completely oral lichen plan is right
also clinical examination revealed that
she had such lesions in the genital area
as well usually you see lichen planners
it's an autoimmune condition which can
affect other parts of the body also like
skin and also in the genital area
especially in females females are most
commonly affected and you can see lichen
plane is associated with genital areas
as well so this will help us in
diagnosing better also on the skin in
this patient you saw something called as
purple plaques were seen
okay with white proriatic lines on both
upper and lower limbs
so
i you diagnosed that it is a oral lichen
planus now what is the question i am
asking you what is the characteristic
histological presentation of this
disease
colloid bodies
highland bodies
max dose of spaces
civic bodies all of the upper what is
your answer your answer should be all of
the upper so this is oral lichen planus
it is an autoimmune disorder
right you see you see we can stray
okay on the buccal mucosa where you see
web like interlacing white
lesions
okay on both usually it is bilateral but
it is not a thing that it has to be
bilateral map or like in planets that
did not give bilateral not necessarily i
myself in my career i have seen many
cases where you have you can see
unilateral uh like in planets as well so
it is by being bilateral is not
pathognomic of diagnosing oral like in
planets please remember that okay so
females are usually more
more affected than males okay and what
are the types you see reticular like in
planners erosive
bullets
popular atrophic and clock like six
types of clinical presentations based on
how they appear clinically they are
divided like that okay and you as you
know buccal mucosa is the most common
area of presentation and histological
presentation is very important because
you diagnosed it only after doing a
biopsy so what do you see histologically
you see something related to keratin
what is that hyperkeratosis
hyper keratosis is very important it can
be ortho or para keratosis
okay and what i have not mentioned here
is you also see saw tooth ready picks
ok
and there is degeneration of basal layer
basal layer
okay then you see colloid bodies you see
collide bodies or civic bodies are one
and the same you see highland bodies
highland bodies and collide bodies are
basically uh
given those name based on where they are
present if they're present in the
epithelium they're called as highland
bodies or colloid bodies if they're
present in connective tissue they are
called as so if they're called as color
or civil bodies if they're present in
connective tissue they're called as
highland bodies so they're just based on
the differentiation based on location
where they are present they are given
that name you see max joseph spaces also
so all these are histological
presentations of oral lichen planners
and also they can ask you one more
question what are the five piece or the
six piece associated with lichen planus
so what are the piece you see through
rytic itching polygonal they are usually
polygonal
purple in color plaque like
okay and planar
okay so these are the usually purple
proritic polygonal planar blacklight and
uh
that's it right
proritic polygonal planar purple plaque
like popular so these are the six piece
of oral lichen planus
okay
so this is the thing
so in this presentation i have discussed
ten beautiful patient boxes okay and i
have given all the pictures along with
it it is not necessary please be careful
that they can give you picture always
when they ask you in your inbda exams
they can also give you without a picture
so please if if a picture is there
definitely it will be useful in
diagnosing but even if you don't have a
clinical or a radiological picture
please look at the
patient box please write try to read
each and every data and narrow down the
diagnosis like i have explained how you
have to do it okay and then read the
question properly answer it okay i hope
and i pray that you people do very well
in your exams okay and i hope that these
will be very helpful to you in your
preparation okay thank you so much take
