hello and welcome to this session on i
traders in python
today we are gonna talk about how to use
and build iterators in python
iterators is a very important concept
across all programming languages because
it's a necessity
and you will feel the need wherever you
will have to loop across different
elements lists arrays and etc so today
we are going to talk about how
iterators are used in python and what
are the nitty gritties
now what's in it for us today
we are going to talk about what is a
python nitrater what are iterables right
what are the iterable objects
how an iterator works
and then we will also discuss about how
to throw a stop iteration exception
basically when you reach the end of a
list
then you can throw a stop iteration
exception and we will see that with an
example
now what is a python iterator
python nitrator is an object that can
traverse through iterable objects in
python like lists tuples dictionaries
sets
and returns data one element at a time
so basically you can traverse through
these layers one at a time and then you
can use it as per your custom
requirement but iterator as an object is
available to you is a tool available to
you in order to traverse through each
and every element
now
they have implemented within for loops
comprehensions generators in python
implicitly they are not visible up front
but they are hidden in plain sight so
basically when you're using loops when
you're using generators comprehensions
implicitly
python is actually converting them in
the backend in an iterator object and
giving you the results
now what are iterables on which you can
iterate
lists tuples dictionaries sets as i
mentioned are all iterables or iterable
objects other than these you can't
perform any iteration if you have not
created an object of list tuple or
dictionary or set then of course your
write variable will not be of any use
and
these objects internally possess an item
method iter method which is used to get
an iterator a handle to a nitrater and
then you can start
looping it or you can start accessing
the elements of the iterator
now how iterator works
python iterator implements internally
these two methods which we are seeing on
the screen underscore underscore item
underscore underscore brackets and
underscore underscore next underscore
underscore bracket
now these two methods are implicitly
implemented by python for any internal
implicit iterator
object
but if you have to write your own custom
iterator then you need to override these
methods and i'll show you in my examples
in jupyter notebook
the iterator object is initialized using
the either method so basically whenever
you have to create an iterator object
you need to initialize it with iter and
then use next method in order to
traverse through it
now stop iteration exception so as i
mentioned when we reach the end of an
iterable right like suppose you have a
list or a set which has a length of four
when you have ended the fourth element
and you're trying to access something
beyond fourth element which is fifth
then of course you can implicitly raise
a stop iteration exception or python
will throw it so we will see that with
an example but you will get a stop
iteration exception
now so to prevent in order to
handle it
or
manage it in your course we use top
iteration statement to raise an error
you can raise your customer error so you
can catch this exception
and then raise your custom error in the
underscore underscore next method
so now let's uh support everything with
our examples
let's start with a very basic
example of an iterator
now let me create a list
with just four
numbers
and
as i said i'm going to initialize my
iterator with item method so now i have
created a list and now i am initializing
it with item okay
now using next i'm gonna print my first
element four okay so it means the iter
internally has given me handle to the
first element
and now as many times i move print next
i am moving to the next element
so now i'm also going to show you a
different syntax this is a syntax but
the output will be same it's a different
syntax to invoke underscore next so it's
output is going to be same but the
syntax is only the difference over here
so you're going to get access to the
next element and then
my fourth element just 33 now i have
traversed through all my four elements
now what will happen if i again do next
i have ended i am at the end of my list
so i will get an exception of stop ice
iteration right and this is thrown by
python
now let's take another interesting
example if i want to perform iteration
on strings
so i have created a variable and i have
initialized it with geeks
and now i have created an iterator on
top of this
string variable and i'm going to
traverse it
till the time i end reach the end of my
string
so let me
hydrate it and i'm going to iterate till
the time i get the stop iteration
exception
so also i'm actually explaining here how
to cleanly handle the exception
accept
and then break if i get the exception
i'll break out of this program
and here you get the result
all the letters of my string geeks has
been printed individually
and i think it's a very important
example interesting example that how a
string has been converted now point to
be noted over here is
that python has internally invoked
underscore underscore iter and
underscore underscore next methods which
it has implicitly implemented for string
iterators so you don't need to do
anything
now let's take another example to how to
traverse through a list
using for
loop
so i'm going to leave for object in list
and just print the list this is
without an iterator i'm just printing my
list so i'm just trying to show the
difference that if you use a nitrater or
you do not but how you can access the
elements in the list
now let's take an example of how i can
write my own custom iterator
okay so i'm
creating a class where i'm overriding
the init method
basically initializing in his
initialization of my class where i'm
gonna initialize a variable max with 0
and then
i am overriding this is the most
important point over here i am
overriding iter
method
and then
i am writing another overriding the
underscore underscore next method
where i am adding
6 to my number and then incrementing my
loop
so that
i
can move further
so in this underscore next method i am
just
moving beyond adding 6 and till the time
i reach the max variable
so when i'll invoke my class
i am passing 9 so it means that i should
not
go beyond
10 basically i should start my iteration
from 6 and will not go beyond 10 9 plus
1
so i should get numbers which are
between 6 to 10 as per my expectation
now before we diagnose the output most
important point is that how you have
converted your class to an iterator over
here
you in order to invoke make an uh class
in nitrater it is mandatory you override
it ar and next methods which you have
done over here
so now let's print
okay
so six so my
number started with zero initialize with
0 and i added
6 to it so my first result is 6
and now if i keep printing i will get 1
value incremented
7
eight
nine
and
10 right so this is the expected output
right
now
another example on the same lines i'm
gonna print the first 20 numbers using
my iterator
so i am
gonna overwrite the iter method and
underscore underscore next method my
numbers now in this
underscore underscore next method i am
just incrementing my number y one
not by six and i'm gonna stop at the
limit twenty
so like i showed in my previous example
i'm gonna initialize first my class
and then
initialize my iterator and just then
gonna run a for loop on it
and here is the response output i have
printed the first 20 numbers because i
have created this limit
so i am initializing with 1
and going till the max 20 number
but the point is it's not the output
which is more important over here the
most important concept over here is that
you have created your own iterator and
leveraged it
i hope you had a great learning session
and i look forward to meeting you in my
next session thank you
