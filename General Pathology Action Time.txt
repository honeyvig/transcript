hi Venus I'm back here to give a
detailed description of what you need to
learn or what you need to focus when
you're taking general pathology okay so
come to the neat blueprint okay so if
you see need blueprint general pathology
has a radius of seven marks okay along
with microbiology genital pathology is
going to carry 14 marks so average of
seven marks is given for general path
okay so apart from this if you just have
an analysis of the recent PGA and Ames
as well as the jitmoud it has a decent
Vettes okay for in in PGA okay 400 marks
100 MCQs pathology has a radius of two
to four marks and in jipner also it has
a rough Waiters of around four marks to
five marks as general pathology in
majority of the times the question comes
with the combination of oral pathology
in most of the times it is very
difficult for analysis of the pathology
related specific questions okay so in
Ames it has a rough weight as of more
than ten marks okay so this is how you
need to segregate your time basing upon
the wait days of MCQs or basing upon the
importance of a particular subject in
your examination for example if a
subject is carrying more weight is okay
the subject is carrying more weight as
you need to spend more time in cracking
those marks if subject is carrying less
weight is you have to give a bit less
important
to the subject this is how smartly how
to modify your preparation okay
previously when we used to prepare okay
we don't have this rate is segregation
or analysis segregation so we regularly
used to keep like one week or ten days
for general path same goes one week or
ten days for Peter one week or 10 days
for consonant oh okay but now as there
is a drift in the preparation lots of
analysis are going behind the screen by
the Mentors okay mentors are doing lots
of cool work to make the subject simple
and smart okay so with this analysis and
everything I can say you need to be very
specific in finishing general path as
fast as possible and you need to move to
the further subjects and before going
into the schedule of general pathology I
just want to tell you okay tell you a
very important thing like there are many
many topics ok many many topics which
are common for many subjects for example
if I am talking about blood or if I am
talking about disorders of the blood
okay so if you if you come to the first
year subject like physiology okay in
physiology we talk about blood that is
the normal physiology of the blood will
be discussed in the physiology the next
comes in the second year you talk about
drugs which are used in the blood or
drugs which are act which acts on the
blood platelets or RBC or white WBC or
any any sort of drugs which comes in the
blood okay will be discussed in the form
of collagen and the basic pathology
point of view of blood related stuff
will be discussed in the general path
and few aspects about the black pictures
in infections will be discussed in your
microbiology goes to the third year okay
again you have played we talk about
diseases of blood and everything in your
general medicine more to the final layer
okay in fine layer we talk about blood
in your oral path and oral medicine or
oral medicine in radiology we talk about
blood of course barriers related to the
surgery we talk about blood so they are
common things for most of your subjects
I'm taking this into consideration I can
clearly say there are many things which
are common for general path oral path
and general path and general medicine so
regularly your general pathology has to
be done in combination with oral
pathology oral medicine and channel
medicine but due to some compromised
schedules or to do some compromising or
mode of preparation we segregate every
subject we don't read conceptual reading
we never go for a conceptual reading we
go for a subject vice reading so taking
all these into consideration
I have prepared few topics in your
schedule which are only specific to
general pathology whereas few other
topics of general pathology which we are
going to learn in combination with other
subjects I have skipped all those things
because reading the same thing again
from general pathology point again from
general medicine point again from any
other subject point will kill your time
and will make your preparation
incomplete okay you you you may not be
perfect with the topic but you read the
same topic many many many times which is
not a smart reparation according to me
so to my point of view these are the
topics which are limited only to the
journey path okay so 21st that is
tomorrow we're going to have a June
class for the people who are starting
their proceedings okay it's not for all
it is for the people who are starting
the proceedings we'll have an
interaction with them and old bad
students okay you're going to have a
paper discussion you want to have your
general surgery paper discussion this is
for the old bad students and the new bad
students which are going to start the
preparation from tomorrow they're going
to have an
direction with a specific mentor about
the touts clarity about the preparation
goals XY
so from 22nd officially we are going to
start general pathology okay so for
general pathology as all these subjects
are all these topics are very specific
to general pathology every topic has a
rating of five you need to be utmost
clear with each and every topic in this
in this list okay so what book to be
followed
I I prefer that if there are many other
high end books but to our level as as a
dental student point of view you're
Harsha Mohan is more than sufficient
textbook of pathology by Hirsch Mohan
sir is more than sufficient to get the
perfect concepts okay you have your
dental version yes well and good if you
don't have your dental version if you
have the general version or any any any
of the versions you can pick and you can
start your preparation that is more than
sufficient but make a note Harsha Mohan
textbook of general pathology is just a
reference book whenever you are not
clear with the concepts whenever you
want to be perfect with the concepts
whenever you have time open the book and
read but in the regular scenario you
should be focused more on the
preparation because we have a limited
time but we need to complete the
syllabus so the target of us for this
particular schedule is the grand exam
which is which will be on general
pathology and specific will be on 31st
month and so you have how many days to
crack the subject one two three four
five six seven days preparation with
today's revision so you have nine days
to crack this general pathology
take it so how you need to handle okay
so in our UC life okay if you remember
like what we have what you have done or
I have done when I'm doing the second
medias when I'm handling the
general path most of we are familiar
with all these topics that is cell
injury where we talking about necrosis
apoptosis and all these things
inflammatory mediators and how the
inflammation acute chronic what are the
differences and everything hemodynamics
how edema is formed all those flowcharts
and everything and of course we learn
about the cancer preventing say Jane's
cancer promoting genes Pro oncogenes all
these everything the only topic which we
are not clear with is the genetics
genetics is of less important for a
dental student in your general pathology
pointer so genetics will mostly move
around the genes gene numbers gene names
which causes cancer which are specific
markers tumor markers all these genes
the mode of transmission the mode of
occurrence different types of
abnormalities of genes all your trisomy
is mono zoom is all your all all such
things which are at microscope level
like if you know that Down syndrome is
also called as trisomy of 21 but what
microscopically happens what is trisomy
21 in specific what is microscopic view
of all the things will be learned in
genetics and genes in general pathology
which is very specific to this subject
okay G's will learn in May the other
subjects like you can talk about genes
and biochemistry but I made genetics
very specific to that of general
pathology okay and most of other topics
what I have mentioned are very common
things but you need to learn the concept
behind the thing okay which may or may
not be bounced as a question for you but
make sure you as a conker's you as the
students of MDS conquer family should be
very strong in each and every aspect
okay what my target is like I just want
to prepare you okay I want to make your
armamentarium in such a way that you
should get questions you should get
answers for all 240 questions in the
examination nothing is unimportant
according to me
I want you to be perfect with the
concepts so that you can handle the
stress in the examination hall in the
most easiest way so this is how the plan
whew diagram based aspects are important
okay but don't go to the level of a
medical student where they will ask the
pathology specimens which are very very
less concern for a dental student so
what we have some limitations and we
need to take the limitations into
consideration okay
learn but learn up to the level okay
don't go beyond that because as already
discussed the weight is of these subject
is not that great because you cannot
differentiate an overall path question
from general path question so try your
best to cover as many things as possible
so apart from this there is one more
topic which is very specific and
important to general pathology that is
the diseases of blood in general
pathology point okay so almost the same
as general medicine point or you have
the same topic in your oral path oral
medicine also okay so I'll be focusing
more when I'm talking about the medical
aspect that is general medicine I am
talking talking or taking discussions on
general medicine I will be covering all
those blood and every I mean like the
system specific like if I'm talking
about GI T few pathology aspects of GRE
so such things will be covered along
with the general medicine or will pass
on oral medicine okay so please try to
be more focused on these topics and try
to be perfect because we have only seven
days and of course it is covered 19
where we were locked down we have
limitations so please try to be safe and
secured at home by following the
precautions but make sure you your best
shot for this upcoming nine days to make
your end of the meal okay that is the
last place we are in the last phase of
me to be best for your preparation so as
always says always says this preparation
or what you're doing should be your best
and should be your last
and make a note many Fela subject is
boring like for example if if you talk
to me to me the most boring subject is
Anatomy
I feel Anatomy is boring to me I feel
like biochemistry is boring to me I feel
the general path is boring to me
there are few other subjects which are
boring to me so what I do and I I come
across a boring subject which has the
waiters in the examination which which
is going to decide you're wrong rank
which is going to decide your fate your
outcome your success your college your
department and and and this simple
scores which are going to decide your
life totally okay so what I do is but I
want to inject something into my body I
just love it and first love it I add
some love towards it so people who feel
like Board of general path first and now
to it make your conscious now general
path make your conscious loud Chandra
pharmacology so if you feel like tricky
subjects love them more and probably
preferably this is this is going to be
last time in your life time you may read
general path of course you read in your
final MDS or your first MDS for your
basic paper but that most important you
go to general path will be very very
limited hardly you may read half a day
in your future for the examinations in
there
once you enter into the MDS half at a
maximum so so this is going to be last
born between you and general path so
give your best shot for jungle path now
jungle path okay so signing off from
team MDS conquer stay safe at home enjoy
gentle that
