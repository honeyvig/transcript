hey guys welcome to yet another
interesting and informative video by
simply learn in today's video we're
gonna be learning all about heap data
structure in c but before we begin if
you haven't subscribed to our channel
already make sure to hit the subscribe
button and the bell icon to never miss
an update so now without any further
delay let's begin
this session will help you understand
what heap data structure is in c
after that let us know the types of heap
data structure followed by heap
insertion and deletion operation
now let's begin by understanding what
heap data structure in c is
the first thing to know is what is a hip
hip is a free pull or memory storage
space to store data dynamically
in program memory the memory is divided
into code data stack and hip
so when program variables are allocated
dynamically it is stored in the heap
memory storage we quickly store the
elements in a hip to access the maximum
or minimum elements of the data
structure
and
in c programming heap is a complete tree
based data structure following a
specific order a heap consists of a root
node parent node and a child node
the way roots are necessary for a tree
similarly a root node is very important
in a hip
the element of a root node is always
greater than or equal to the other tree
nodes or it can be smaller than or equal
to its child node
suppose we have an array of elements 7 5
6 2 and 3
and the index starts from 0 up to 4. so
with this let's implement a tree based
data structure
as you can see the highest element is
our root node followed by the children
nodes
node element 5 and 6 are the child nodes
of node 7 whereas note 5 is a parent
node of 2 and 3 and if it is required to
insert a few more elements in a hip it
starts inserting from left to right
and let the root node index be 0 and
goes up to the elements present in a hip
now we know what a heap data structure
is and why heap is used in c programming
let's move ahead and understand the
types of heap data structure in c
there are two types of heaps maxip and
min hip
in a max heap
the elements of the root node must be
greater than or equal to the elements of
its children's node
now let's see its example
in this particular example 7 is the
largest element than other elements in
the node so when you see towards down
the hip parent node element is greater
than its children node for example root
node 7 is greater than 5 and 6 and 5 is
greater than its children node 2 and 3.
minip is just opposite of max hip
the root node element of a min hip is
lesser than or equal to its children
node for example
2 is lesser than all other nodes in a
hip the parent node 3 is lesser than its
children node 6 and 7.
so i think you understood maxip and min
hip well
ok so let us move on to the max hip
implementation
here we have an example
the hip elements are 7 2 6 5 and 3.
now look at the steps to implement a hip
let the root node index be i the current
element and set the current element i to
be the largest
in this given example a parent node of 5
and 3 which is 2 is lesser than its
children node so happify the hip
the left child index is given in terms
of 2 i plus 1 and the right child index
is 2 i plus 2.
by considering this example the index of
node 2 is 1
so by calculating the left child index
2i plus 1 whereas i is equal to 1 so 2
into 1 is equal to 2 plus 1 is equal to
3
swap the element with the index node 3
that is swap the elements 2 and 5. so
now the parent node is greater than is
children node
and finally the tree is hepified
now let's have a look at the hip
insertion operation
let's insert one new element into the
hip
for example if the element is 7 to be
inserted then it will be inserted from
left to right at the bottom of the hip
since the parent node element is less
than its child node that is 6 is less
than 7 so we must happify
so the next step is to happify the tree
by swapping the elements
and finally the element is added to the
hip
next is a hip deletion
operation suppose we want to delete one
element from the hip
so let's consider element 5 to be
deleted and to delete element 5 swap the
element with the last node element 7
and finally remove the last element from
the hip
now let's run this simple program using
hip data structure
so in this program we are going to
insert and apply the heap elements to
organize the data of a heap max we have
swap function in which we are going to
swap the elements between parent node
and child node
following we have a heap function
it first checks whether the size is
equal to 1 it means there is only one
element in the hip
else it will set the current element i
to be largest
as i discussed before the left node
index is given in terms of 2 into i plus
1 and right node is 2 into i plus 2
and if left node is less than the size
of hip and greater than the largest then
it will set the left node to be largest
similarly we do for the right node
and then we have an insertion function
to insert the elements in the hip
using if condition it will first check
the size of it if it is 0
then array index of 0 will be the new
element
and then increase the size by 1.
else array size is new element so once
we insert the element into the hip we
are calling a heap function to organize
the data that means to happify
and once the data is happified
we have a print function it will print
all the array elements
and then inside the main function
we are giving the values to insert the
elements and they are 10
3
4
2 and 6
and finally it will print the hepifed
maxhip elements
so now let's run the program and see the
output
as you can see the happy find maxip
elements are 10 6 4 2 and 3.
so now let's try to insert one more
element and see the output
so let's insert the element 8
save the program and run
and here we go
the element 8 is successfully inserted
in our next program let's try to perform
deletion operation
so let's try to delete one element from
the hip so for that we have a deletion
function
if number to be deleted is equal to the
array of index
then swap the element with the last node
so
calling the heap function to helpify the
elements and display it
and inside the main function
we are going to mention
the element to be deleted that is 6
so now let's run it
as you can see the element 6 is deleted
successfully
and the elements after deleting are 10 4
8 2 and 3.
and with this we have come to the end of
the session on the hip data structure in
c
i hope this session was informative and
interesting until next time thank you
