let's get started we will first discuss
the job role first let's discuss about
data scientist data scientists are
skilled professionals who understand the
business challenges and opportunities
and develop the best solution using
modern tools and techniques they use
statistical methods data visualization
techniques and machine learning
algorithms to build predictive models
and solve complex problems data
scientists derive meaningful information
from messy and unstructured data they
also communicate important information
and insights to Business Leaders and
various stakeholders data scientists are
primarily problem solvers data
scientists seek to determine the
questions that need answers and devise
different approaches to try and solve
the problem some of the data related
tasks that a data scientist might tackle
on a day-to-day basis include perform
ad-hoc data mining use various
statistical methods and data
visualization techniques to design and
evaluate Advanced statistical models
from vast amounts of data build AI
models using various algorithms and
inbuilt libraries or to make tedious
tasks and generate insights using
machine learning models next let's
proceed with discussing about data
analyst a data analyst is a skilled
professional who collects data from
multiple sources organizes and perform
analysis on it businesses generate data
in the form of log files customer
information transaction data Etc data
analyst job is to transform these
valuable business data into actionable
insights data analysts use data
manipulation techniques to analyze and
interpret complex data sets to help
businesses and organizations make better
decisions some of the data related tasks
that a data scientist might tackle on a
day-to-day basis include delivering
reports examining patterns gather data
from various databases and warehouses
filter and clean it write complex SQL
queries and scripts to collect store
manipulate and reduce data from rdbms
such as MySQL server Oracle database and
MySQL so far we have a comfortable
understanding of the job roles of data
scientist and data analyst next we'll
proceed with learning about the skills
required to become a data scientist and
also the skills required to become a
data analyst so first let's begin with
data scientist statistics and
probability data scientists must be
provisioned in statistics and
probability to understand and analyze
data machine learning and deep learning
data scientists need to be familiar with
machine learning and deep learning
algorithms to build predictive models
programming data scientists must be
proficient in programming languages such
as python R and SQL to manipulate and
analyze data data visualization data
scientists need to be able to visualize
data to communicate their findings to
others so far we cover the significant
skills required by a data scientist
let's proceed with those required by a
data analyst starting with business
intelligence data analysts must be
familiar with business intelligence
tools to analyze data and identify
Trends communication data analysts need
to be able to communicate their findings
to Technical and non-technical audiences
collaboration data analysts need to be
able to collaborate with other data
scientists and genius and business
stakeholders attention to detail data
analysts need to be detail-oriented to
identify data errors and ensure their
findings accuracy if you have paid
attention to the skills discussed you
can see that a few go hand in hand with
both roads skills like data
visualization Tableau power bi Excel
Proficiency in Python R and SQL are some
skills the professionals need as an
essential prerequisite also bachelor's
degree in computer science engineering
or equivalent is advantageous however
with the skills discussed we made it
halfway through the session now before
we move on to the next part let's hear
