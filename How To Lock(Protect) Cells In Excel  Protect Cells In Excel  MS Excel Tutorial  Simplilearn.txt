hey everyone welcome to simply learn's
youtube channel in this session we will
learn how to protect and lock cells in
excel now why do we need to lock or
protect cells in excel
let us imagine that there is an excel
sheet with really confidential data and
you need to pass that data to your
subordinate or your currently to make
some minor edits
now let us imagine that the edits are
supposed to be done to only one or two
columns and the rest of the columns
should be left as they are
now there is a huge possibility that
sometimes unknowingly or unwillingly
there might be some edits done by your
colleague or your subordinate so to
avoid such kind of unexpected mistakes
you might want to protect and lock
yourselves that you don't want your
subordinate or your colleague to edit
so before we begin be kind enough to get
subscribed to our youtube channel and
don't forget to hit that bell icon to
stay updated on the latest it trends and
tech content
now without further ado let's get
started with our one point agenda that
is lock or protect cells in excel now
let's get back into the practical mode
and start our microsoft excel
now we are on the microsoft excel and
this particular spreadsheet is related
to employee details
yeah now the screen is visible a bit
better now let us imagine that this is
our confidential data
and you want to edit only two columns
that is the designation column and phone
number column now let us imagine that
the company has finished one annual year
and now there are some promotions
happening in the company and let us also
imagine that the phone numbers of the
employees provided by the company have
undergone some changes so now the minor
edits that you want to make are related
to the designation column and phone
number column now you can see that all
the columns that is the blood group new
salary salary hike current salary and
name of the employee serial number
employee number everything is editable
so in such kind of scenarios when you
pass on this data there might be a
possibility where your colleague or
subordinate might end up making some
mistakes right so you want to avoid that
so you can do that by locking the cells
now let us rename this sheet
now the sheet has been renamed
successfully so now you can log the
cells by the following process
so in this process you have two major
steps first one is to log the cells and
the next one is to protect the cells by
a password
now when you select all the cells in
this particular sheet you can just click
on this edge here and you have all the
cells selected and now right click
somewhere on the sheet and you can see
an option called format cells
so in this particular option you have
some options provided which is number
alignment font and you want to go into
the protection part so you can see
by default excel
keeps all the cells locked
now we want the phone number and
designation to be unlocked okay so let's
cancel it for now and get back to the
sheet and select the columns d
and i
and now let's right click
and
go into format cells
and in the protection option make sure
that you uncheck the locked icon
now select ok and now
okay so you cannot include the merge the
cell fine we have a cell here which is
merged okay let's remove that
okay now again select the entire column
right click
get into format cells
and uncheck the lock option select ok
now we have finished the first part that
is
locking all the cells which you don't
want to get edit and unlocking the cells
where you want to make some edits now
the second stage is protecting the sheet
now right click on the sheet name and
you can see an option called protect
sheet click that and now here you can
see select log cells and also select
unlock cells so let us provide a
password here so
let us use some simple password so that
we don't forget that so i will be
selecting one two three
and now select ok
re-enter the password to proceed now let
us type one two three again now select
ok and now the sheet is protected
now we have successfully
locked and protected all the cells in
excel
now let us verify that the cells you
wanted to protect are really protected
and locked or not so we have unlocked
phone number and designation and
everything else is locked now let me try
and edit the blood group so when i
double click or try to edit this
particular sheet then i'll be receiving
a warning from excel it says the cell or
chart you're trying to change is on a
protected sheet to make a change
unprotect the sheet you might be
requested to enter a password
so
it says that this particular cell is
locked and you cannot edit it now let us
try to edit the phone numbers which we
kept as unlocked
so you can see i can really edit the
unlocked cell here now let me try to
change this phone number let me enter
some random phone number
so you can see the cell is editable
now let us go through the designation
column and try to
edit this particular column now since i
said that there's a promotion happening
in the company so the deputy ceo is now
the current ceo of the company
and the software developer happens to
become the semia software developer
and the tester as well let us imagine
that he will become the senior
and so on
okay
so this proves that this particular
sheet is editable not the entire sheet
but only the sense that we kept in the
analog mode
okay
now this is how you lock and protect
your cells in excel
with that we have come to an end of this
tutorial on how to lock and protect
yourselves in excel if you have any
