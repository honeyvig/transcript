description box and pin comment so let's
get started so guys this is the
Microsoft co-pilot on the screen and you
could see that Microsoft co-pilot is an
Innovative gen tool that offers a
vertile and userfriendly experience
across various platforms and there are
three ways to access it that is first
directly within windows and then the
edge browser and as a standalone web
tool accessible via bank or any
dedicated website or browser so you
could see here this is the icon so this
is for the co-pilot only and if we open
the edge browser you will get an icon
here so here also you can access it or
else you could search on the web that is
copilot and you will get
it here only so you could see we have
clicked on the first link and here is a
Microsoft co-pilot and for Windows 11
users copilot can be quickly accessed
through an icon that is next to the
search box as you can see here that is
the co-pilot pre verion and this
provides a persistent right hand pan for
seamless multitasking and in Edge
co-pilot enhances browsing with a
dedicated pain for immediate assistance
featuring Advanced functionalities like
web page summarization additionally
anyone can utilize co-pilot VI Bing or
any web portal requiring only a
Microsoft ID for Access and is
compatible with multiple browsers on
Windows and Mac OS so this broad
accessibility caters to diverse user
preferences and workflow
making copilot a highly adaptable AI
assistant and if we talk about its
features or first we'll see the pro
version that is co-pilot Pro so here you
could see that that the Microsoft
co-pilot Pro it's available for
individuals or the creators and power
users looking to off for co-pilot Pro so
you could have it for 2,000 Rupees per
user per month so as I'm assessing the
website from India you could see the
amount in rupees and we convert into
dollars so the dollar amount is $20 per
month and you could use the free version
of co-pilot and then we have the
co-pilot for businesses and in India the
pricing varies from around
2,495 and that to you have to give an
annual commitment and the price in
dollars is around $30 per month and for
that also you have to give the annual
commitment so let's have an overview of
let's get back to co-pilot Pro so you
could see that you would get the answers
faster with the co-pilot Pro you can
unlock co-pilot in your favorite apps
that is you could experience it in Word
Excel PowerPoint and Outlook and a whole
new way with built-in co-pilot features
so with the co-pilot basic version or
the free version you won't be having the
accessible version in all these apps but
with the co-pilot Pro you could have it
and you can create and design better
than ever that is you could create image
is that is a way more enhanced and
informative than the free version and
this tool also uses the D 3 and you have
the 100 daily boost with designer and
here's the comparison between the
co-pilot and the co-pilot Pro so in this
the co-pilot you would have access to
the gp4 and gp4 turbo during non peak
times whereas in co-pilot Pro you have
the access to gp4 and gp4 turbo even
during P cars that is for the faster
performance and here
you could use co-pilot for the web in
Windows Mac OS and iPad OS and you could
use text voice and images in
conversational search and you can create
and edit AI images with 15 boost per day
with designer and you could use plugins
and gpds and if you talk about the
co-pilot Pro you have the gb4 and gb4
Turbo with all the times and then we
have individual needs and interest you
could use the gpds own co-pilot gpts and
then we have have the productivity apps
like word excel PowerPoint and Outlook
you could integrate the co-pilot in that
if you have the pro version and you
could generate Unique Images that we
have already talked about and here you
could see that they have given us the
experience AI in Word Excel powerport
and Outlook like never before so this
was about an overview of the co-pilot so
let's move and have a hands on co-pilot
we'll run some prompts and see what we
can do with the co-pilot so let's start
with the summarization and we will open
the simply learn website for articles
and ask copilot to summarize it for us
so we have the software development
articles okay the front end one we'll
copy the link and get back to
copilot and ask
him so it has already
starting giving us the summary of it and
now we can ask
him can you
summarize the
article provided in the
link so you could see that it has
provided the summarization in a very
concise manner you would also ask him
that you could provide
us that provide this in around
400 words or 300
words so the co-pilot will do that for
you and like you could use it for the
more creative version that is this is
best for genetic imaginative responses
such as drafting marketing copy or
brainstorming ideas that is not ideal
for work related task or you could use
it for more precise version that is you
could ask him to deliver concise fact
focused responses suitable for task
requiring straightforward information we
have different versions also for the
co-pilot uh as you could see there's a
conversational style so the more
creative version is best for generating
imaginative responses such as drafting
marketing copy or brainstorming ideas
that is not ideal for work related task
so first talk about more balanced
version so this offers a mix of creative
and precise responses and that is useful
for planning or seeking recommendations
and then comes the more precise one
that delivers concise fact focused
responses suitable for task requiring
straightforward information so you would
see or use accordingly and we have
created a web page summary now we'll ask
him to create a first draft so first we
will ask him to draft an email so
co-pilot can assist in crafting initial
drafts for various documents like emails
for marketing pitches that allows
customization in terms of tone format
and English so here we will ask
him write a first
draft for an
email
for asking
you group
manager
[Music]
to to
provide
permission to install
coffee
machine so let's
see you would see that the copilot has
started generating the
response
and for the first St of the email he has
provided us the subject then the de
group manager name and I hope this email
finds well and I'm writing to request
permission for the installation of a p
machine and here the key Point
supporting this request and then the
proposed coffee machine options so these
are the options that could be installed
and then the implementation plan like if
approved we appro or we propose placing
the coffee machine in the common area
that if the proposal gets approved you
could have an area dedicated for the
coffee machine so you could see that how
beautifully it has crafted the response
and then you could use another feature
that is
you could insert
images add an image here so let's search
for an image and ask him so we'll search
for Tower of
Piza and let's ask him about that so we
will copy an image for that copy the
image and let's paste it
here okay it's not taking as a paste so
we have to upload it so let's get back
there and we'll save
this and the
downloads and the
Articles we'll name it
as to of P that is a JP
image let's go back to Coop
pilot and we'll upload the image here
mov to the downloads articles the Tower
of Pisa and let's ask the
co-pilot can you
describe what is
depicted in the
image
and if there
is
something
famous about
it so let's see how will the co-pilot
respond to us so you could see that it's
analyzing the
image so here's the response generated
by the co-pilot that is design and
purpose so the Leaning Tower p is the
campan a freestanding belt Tower so it
has recog the image and provided that it
is the Tower of Pizza only and the
height and the width and its weight and
the history and lean and the
architectural
controversy so you could see that it has
very well recognized the image and
provided all the information about it so
using co-pilot can initially be somewhat
Airy but its response are often
humanlike so you could see that it has
provided us a very good responses during
the summarization process or Drafting
and email or just recognizing an image
this was about the free version so you
could provide prompts to the co-pilot
and it will work for you and here's one
thing that you shouldn't be fooled by
the co-pilot's hallucination because
Coop pilot appears to be all seeing all
knowing font of information and able to
pull out the most AR facts on request
but that's not the case in truth it's
most like a not always reliable because
it's a a selftaught polymath who when
converted with a question he can't
answer so it can make something up in
order to appear more knowledgeable than
he really is so keep that in mind and
don't blindly trust the co-pilot and
then we have to check for the co-pilot
plag rism because what it provides is
not fully plag rism free so you have to
keep that also in mind and you could
also generate the images with the
Microsoft image creator and that is a
very good function if you have the
co-pilot pro version so with that guys
we have come to the end of this session
and I hope you guys will find the
prompts for the co-pilot and use it and
see how well it respond to you so if you
