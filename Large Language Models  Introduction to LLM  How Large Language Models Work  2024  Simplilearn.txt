hello everyone I am M and welcome to
today's video where we dive into the
fascinating world of large language
models llms if you ever wondered how
machine learning can Now understand and
generate humanlike text you are in the
right place from chat boards like chat
GPD to AI assistant that power search
engines llms are transforming how we
interact with technology one of the most
exciting advancement in this space is
Google Gemini or openi chg a cutting as
large language model designed to push
the boundaries of what AI can achieve in
this video we will explore what llms are
how they work and why models like gini
are critical for the future of AI Google
Gemini is part of a new wave of AI
models that are smarter faster and more
efficient it is designed to understand
context better offer more accurate
responses and integrate deeply into
service like Google search and Google
Assistant providing more humanik
interactions so we will break down the
science behind llms including their
massive training data set Transformer
architecture and how models like Gemini
use deep learning Innovation to change
Industries plus we will compare Google
Gemini to other popular llm such as open
aity models showing how each of these
Technologies is used to power chat
boards virtual assistants and other AI
driven application by end of this video
you will have a clear understanding of
how large language models like chamini
work their key features and what they
mean for their future

whether you're making a switch or aiming

learn a ml from the industry experts I
simply postgraduate program in and
machine learning from P University in
collaboration with ibia this score

forget to check out the course link from
the description box below and the pin
comment so without any further Ado let's
get started so what are the large
language models large language models
like CH GPD 4 Genera pre-trained
Transformer 4 o and Google Gemini are
sophisticated AI system designed to
comprehend and generate humanik text
these models are built using deep
learning techniques and are trained on
was data set collected from the internet
they leverage self attention mechanism
to analyze relationship between words or
tokens allowing them to capture context
and produce coherent relevant responses
llms have significant application
including powering virtual assistant
chat boards content creation language
translation and supporting research and
decision making their ability to
generate fluent and contextually
appropriate text has advanced natural
language processing and improved human
computer interaction so now let's see
what are large language model used for
large language models are utilized in
scenarios with limited or no domain
specific data available for training
these scenarios include both few short
and zero short training approaches which
rely on the models strong inductive bias
and its capability to derive meaningful
representation from a small amount of
data or even no data at all so now let's
see how are large language model trained
large language models typically undergo
pre-training on a board all encompassing
data set that shares statical
similarities with the data set is
specific to the Target task the
objective of pretaining is to enable the
model toire high level feature that can
later be applied during the fine tuning
phase for specific task so there are
some training processes of llm which
involves several steps the first one is
text pre-processing the textual data is
transformed into a numerical
representation that the llm model can
effectively process this conversion may
be involved techniques like tokenization
and coding and creating input sequences
the second one is random parameter
initialization the models parameter are
initialized randomly before the training
process begins the third one is input
numerical data the numerical
representation of the text data is fed
into the model of processing the model's
architecture typically based on
Transformers allows it to capture the
conceptual relationship between the
words or tokens in the next the fourth
one is loss function calculation a loss
function calculation measure the
discrepency between the models
prediction and the actual next word or
token in a sentex the llm model aims to
minimize this LW during training the
fifth one is parameter optimization the
models parameter are registered through
optimization technique this involves
calculating gradient and updating the
parameters accordingly gradually
improving the model's performance the
last one is addative training the
training process is repeated over
multiple iteration or EPO until the
models output achieve a satisfactory
level of accuracy on that given task or
data set by following this training
process large language model learn to
capture linguistic patterns understand
context and generate coherent responses
enabling them to excel at various
language related tasks the next topic is
how do large language models work so
large language models leverage deep
neural network to generate output based
on patterns learn from the training data
typically a large language model adopts
a Transformer architecture which enables
the model to identify relationship
between words in a sentence irrespective
of their position in the sequence in
contrast to RNs that rely on recurrence
to capture token relationship
Transformer neural network employ self
attention as their primary mechanism
self attention calculates attention
scores that determine the importance of
each token with respect to the Token in
the text sequence facilitating the
modeling of integrate relationship
within the data next let's see
application of large language models
large language models have a wide range
of application across various domains so
here are some notable application the
first one is natural language processing
NLP large language models are used to
improve natural language understanding
tasks such as sentiment analysis name
entity recognition text classification
and language modeling the second one is
chatboard and virtual assistant LGE
language models power conversational
agents chat Bots and virtual assistant
providing more interactive and humanik
user interaction the third one is
machine translation L language models
have been used for automatic language
translation enabling text translation
between different languages with
improved accuracy the fourth one is
sentiment analysis llms can analyze and
classify the sentiment or emotion
expressed in a piece of text which is
valuable for market research brand
monitoring and social media analysis the
fifth one is content recommendation
these models can be employed to provide
personalized content recommendations
enhancing user experience and engagement
on platforms such as News website or
streaming services so these application
highlight the potential impact of large
language models in various domains for
improving language understanding
Automation and interaction between
humans and computers with this we have
