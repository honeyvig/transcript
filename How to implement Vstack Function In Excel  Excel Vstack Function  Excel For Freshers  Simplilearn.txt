hey everyone welcome to simply learn's
youtube channel in this session we will
be learning about vstack in excel but
before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have daily updates on multiple
technologies so if you're a tech geek in
a continuous hunt for latest
technological trends then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit that
bell icon to never miss an update from
simply done
now what exactly is we stack
so let's get started with a practical
mode now we are on our excel sheet here
you can see the employee names and
employee ids of different employees from
different zones let us imagine that the
blue one is from east green one is from
west and the black one is from or the
purple one is from
south and the orange one is from north
so
this data is a little small but what if
we had a data with hundreds or thousands
of rows including all the employee names
employee ids or another relevant data
type like sales of an employee and his
employee id
and he was supposed to combine all the
data from all the four different zones
into one single sheet it would consume a
lot of time right so
recently
microsoft has released some
latest updates based on arrays and datas
so one of those is vstack function in
excel so how to use it
since it is a latest function i
recommend you to go to the file menu and
in the file menu you can navigate to
account and in the account you can see
the option of update options
then you can select update now and your
microsoft office will be updated to the
latest version and you will get access
to the latest functions in excel and all
the other office related things like
powerpoint presentation etc
now we are going to implement the vstack
function in excel it is completely
simple all you need to do is equals to
stack
and then select the data
remember to select the data from column
a
and cell 2 or the row 2. we are not
selecting the employee and employee id
we are just selecting the data now
separate them by comma then again this
one here this set and again this one
and again lastly this particular last
set
now close the bracket and press enter
and there you go you have all the
employee names and their respective
employee ids all together in one data
set
so this is how you use vstack function
in excel and there are also few more new
updates from microsoft excel and we will
discuss on them sooner if you have any
queries regarding any of the topics
covered in this session or if you feel
