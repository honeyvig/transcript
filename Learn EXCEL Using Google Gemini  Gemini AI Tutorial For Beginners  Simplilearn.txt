month day example right so enter today
date in a Cell let's say cell one okay
so Excel is now
here okay so what he saying so what it's
saying enter today's date in a Cell
let's say cell A1 you can type directly
that is 2024 this this okay let me copy
it
directly okay and paste it
here
okay okay or use today
function okay fine or else you can write
today function right like this so if I
want to write
here equals to
today enter see you can see the same dat
exact
dat or in another cell that is D1 I
either enter the following formula you
can use this formula date year A1 month
this this this okay so what it will do
so this part extra the ear sell from A1
which has already did this then
month from sell this from sell this so
this is how you can learn any formula
using
Excel
okay so I will WR
write give
me
example
of data in which I can learn
basic basic
formulas of
excel okay so we will learn we will sort
some try to formulas of excel so this
is our you
know particular data set so as you can
see export two sheets so either you can
go directly to the sheets and you can
say sheets and uh this Excel are both
same okay so after that what you can do
you can okay first let me try to copy
it okay if possible okay I'm not
sure uh no it came in once and
only yeah so I can
directly so it's creating
spreadsheet fine open
sheets so yeah so this is the data so
now we're learning with formulas so this
data allows you to learn practice of
what I just copy
everything copy it and P
to
fine so now the thing is that I want to
learn some function so calculate the
total quantity of each product sold by
using the sum function on the quantity
sold column okay so what you have to do
formula in cell E2 for chocolo chips
cake right equals to Su B2 okay so I can
write here in which column E2 column E2
column equals to
sum
E2
B2 enter it's 50 as you can see 50 is
here okay so this is how you can learn
you can uh learn average function okay
let me copy it directly from
here and you can paste it anywhere
okay okay
average of
C2 then C5 okay
fine White's coming like
this okay
E5
right see watch the
issue okay what I can do equals to
average average of
average okay my
bad average
of
this comma this comma this comma this
okay okay so because of dollar it's
happening okay so this is how you can
learn you can find across all using
function the price unit column formula
in cell
E5 E5 e 5 if I will copy
it so this is how you
can okay because of dollar is
happening okay see how it will work now
see because of dollar is happening so
now the average of C2 to C5 is two okay
so this is how you can learn you can
multiply you can apply V look up so
these are some additional tips from the
uh Gemini okay
