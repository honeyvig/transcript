developer then we'll see the difference
between front-end and back-end web
development following that we'll see how
one can become a front-end web developer
following that we'll cover HTML we'll
cover everything about HTML and then
we'll move to CSS for CSS we'll cover a
number of topics like CSS colors CSS
background images then we'll cover CSS
selector CSS Box model CSS flexbox and
CSS grid layout following that will

web development following that we'll
cover what is document object model in
JavaScript and then we'll move on to the
row map of becoming a back-end developer
after that will cover Technologies like
angular and will also see angular
routing following that will cover react
node.js and what is Django after that
we'll cover the Django tutorial followed

add in your resume once we are done with
all this we'll cover interview questions
related to HTML then we'll move on and
cover interview questions about CSS then
we'll cover JavaScript interview
questions followed by angular and react
interview questions
well then in this video by going through
node.js interview questions so sit back
grab your favorite beverage and let's
dive into the world of full stack web
development hey everyone
I'm sure you're all aware that every
application that we use today has
something called the front end which is
the user interface and the back end
which is the software that accesses data
for us and finally we have the database
to store the data
now these three together form something
called as the full stack so hi guys
welcome to this video on what is full
stack by simply learn but before we
begin if you haven't subscribed to our
Channel already make sure to hit the
Subscribe button and the bell icon to
never miss an update so here's what's in
store for you first we'll have a look at
what front-end development is
then we'll see some of the front-end
languages
then we'll move on to some front-end
libraries and Frameworks
then we'll see what back-end development
is understand some of the popularly used
back-end languages and Frameworks and
finally we'll have a look at the
database
so now what exactly is front end every
time you open a website it has several
UI components and once you click on a
particular icon say sign in in this case
you get navigated to the sign in or the
login page right so what happens is that
all of these items facilitate navigation
and utility
these are collectively called as the
front end so the front end is the
visible part of the website or the web
application which is responsible for
user experience the user directly
interacts with the front-end portion of
the website or the web application
so now let's have a look at some of the
front-end languages so I'm sure you've
heard of HTML CSS in JavaScript so these
are collectively called the front-end
languages when it comes to HTML it
defines the structure of websites and
formats the web pages it also defines
text documentation
so let's look at a simple example if
getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit skillup by simply learn click
on the link in the description to know
more
so here I've made use of the H1 tag
which is the heading tag in HTML and
I've displayed the message hello welcome
so correspondingly my website displays
the same message
so HTML is responsible or defines what
is being shown on the website next up is
CSS now CSS is a style sheet that allows
you to alter and style different web
components beat size font spacing Etc it
makes the content on the website look
more decorative correct so now if you
have a look at the code here I've added
some styling I've changed the font style
to italic I've made the text bold and
I've changed the color to red and again
correspondingly all the changes are seen
on the website
moving on we have JavaScript now
JavaScript is a very powerful
client-side scripting language and it is
mainly used for enhancing the
interaction of a user with the web page
so again if you have a look at the code
here I've created a form wherein the
user can enter their name and I've also
displayed the message please enter your
name as a result an input box is made
available where the user can type in
their name now this is facilitated by
JavaScript so as I mentioned earlier it
is used to make web pages interactive
and bring the web applications to life
so next let's have a look at some
front-end Frameworks and libraries now
most of these are JavaScript Frameworks
and libraries first we have react then
there's angular there's view there's
jQuery and then there's bootstrap now
all of these help develop the front end
of the application however when it comes
to react angular in view it's not
necessary that you must know everything
to create a website one of them will be
sufficient however the usage of react is
on the rise and most of the developers
prefer using react jQuery and bootstrap
are also powerful Frameworks that can be
used used to create interactive web
pages now that you know what front-end
development is you must be wondering how
the data is being fetched and how this
data is being presented in front of you
on your screen correct now this is all
facilitated by the back end of the
application so let's understand what
back-end development is
now back end basically refers to the
server-side development of the
application
it is responsible for managing all the
database with the help of queries and
apis so every time the user makes a
request it queries the database and
retrieves the data from the database and
presents it to the user
and lastly it ensures data consistency
so now let's have a look at some
back-end languages and Frameworks
firstly we have node node and express.js
are packages provided by JavaScript
then there's python which is a very
popularly used language python
Frameworks like Django and flask are
popularly used to create the backend of
applications
then there's Java and Java provides
spring and Java server faces which are
also used for backend development then
there's c-sharp which provides
Frameworks like asp.net core and asp.net
MVC and other popularly used back-end
languages are PHP there's Pearl and Ruby
database is the collection of
interrelated data which helps an
efficient retrieval insertion and
deletion of data from database and
organizes the data in the form of tables
views schemas reports now some of the
commonly used database Management
systems are MySQL there's postgresql
there's Microsoft SQL Server this Oracle
database and then there's mongodb but
how can we assembly learn help you if
you wish to make a career as a full
stack developer then a certification
will come in handy for that you could
head to our official website and look
for full stack development courses now
we offer the full step Java developer
Masters program
we also provide the postgraduate program
in full stacked web development and we
also provide the full stack web
developer mean stack Masters program you
can go ahead and click on the program
and have a look at the overview if this
suits your requirements you can go ahead
and purchase the course is how to become
a full stack developer so let's begin
so here are the topics that we're going
to be discussing so first we'll see what
will stack development is who is a full
stack developer then we'll move on to
the responsibilities and then we'll dive
into the detailed roadmap and then also
let you know about the salaries of full
stack Developers
and finally how you can get
certifications
all right now what exactly is full stack
development now consider a web
application
let's see Instagram
so every time you refresh the page new
images are loaded
so this is what the user experiences
right new images are loaded onto his
feed
but what exactly happens behind the
scenes is that the back end fetches new
images from the Instagram servers and
these images are then loaded onto your
Instagram feed right the app is so easy
to use and leaves to users extremely
satisfied
in case of any application there's
always the front end the back end and
the database so the process of building
all of these aspects for an application
is called Full stack development
so I hope you understood what exactly
full stack development is
so moving on
let's see who a full stack developer is
now basically a full stack developer
works with both front end and the back
end of an application
he has to be familiar with languages
like HTML CSS JavaScript and also one or
more backend Frameworks at node.js and
python
now these developers have got all the
web development skills to build websites
and applications from start to finish
now that we've understood what exactly a
full set developer does let's look at
some of his responsibilities
now the first responsibility is
developing the front end so as discussed
they must be able to develop the user
interface for the users with the help of
HTML and CSS
next up is design the back end now this
is also the most crucial part of app
development they should be able to
design robust back-end architecture to
ensure the smooth functioning of
fetching and updation
next up is to design database and
servers now databases and servers must
be resilient to any outages and must
maintain consistency
next up is cross-platform compatibility
now depending on the platforms there
could be some discrepancy and alteration
in the functioning of an application
right it's crucial to make sure that the
applications behave accordingly on all
these platforms
next up is developing apis depending on
the planned architecture the developer
must be able to develop apis
the application must also be responsive
and interactive and keep the user
completely engaged
and lastly it should meet all the
technical and consumer requirements
so these were the few responsibilities
of a full stack developer
moving on let me explain to you a simple
roadmap of how to go about to become a
full stack developer
so this mode map basically shows you the
prerequisites and skills one should have
to become a successful who started
laptop
all right so let's go ahead and begin
with tools and software
and now the first and the most
rudimentary requirement is a text editor
now the most widely used editor is vs
code it is free open source and can be
used to code in different platforms like
Windows Mac OS and Linux
next up is a web browser so you can
either use Firefox or Chrome but Chrome
is highly preferred
now also you could need a few editor
extensions and vs code has a few of them
some of them could be live SAS compiler
and live server
moving on you need to have a good hold
on HTML and CSS
so HTML is a markup language that is
used to define the content that appear
on your web page right the developer can
incorporate images text and videos
depending on the requirements
and moving on to CSS it is basically a
stat sheet which is used to decorate
your entire application it is used to
define the appearance of the content say
in terms of shape color size spacing Etc
next up is Javascript now this is the
most widely used front-end language and
enhances the interaction with the web
page now you might want to brush up your
knowledge on simple Concepts like arrays
functions objects and Loops you can also
learn es6 features like callbacks
promises async await
Dom manipulation and event fetch API and
Json all of these are required when
you're making use of different
JavaScript Frameworks and libraries
so I'd recommend you brush up your
knowledge on all of these topics
react angular View and jQuery are some
of the JavaScript libraries and
Frameworks that one can use now all of
these topics that we discussed earlier
B8 ASX features or basic concepts they
come in very handy when you're using
these Frameworks
among react View and angular over the
last couple of years react has gained
immense popularity followed by which
view is also being widely used now
angular has seen a downward curve over
the past few years so depending on your
requirements you can choose one of these
Frameworks
next up is Version Control now git and
GitHub are the most widely used Version
Control Systems now git basically helps
you manage project files git basically
keeps track of the entire history of
things that the user is working on right
so it makes sure that it allows the user
to backtrack and see what he's worked on
until then
moving on to GitHub it is basically a
web-based service for Version Control
using git now the user can also look
into other people's code identify issues
or errors and also even propose changes
now this comes in extremely helpful when
you're working in a team
let's move ahead and look at some of the
backend environment now the most
popularly used environment is node.js
now this is basically an open source
cross-platform runtime environment that
allows developers to create server-side
tools and applications in JavaScript
now node is typically used to create
real-time applications with two-way
connections where in both the client and
the servers can communicate and exchange
data without any hassle now I really
recommend you have a basic knowledge on
command line as well that is now
knowledge and basic command line like
npm there is no package manager is also
essential
so this was a simple overview on node.js
moving on to other back-end languages
there's Python and the most commonly
used framework that is Django now python
is the easiest programming language out
there and I'm sure everybody will agree
with me with this so it also offers many
libraries and Frameworks for different
Technologies
so when it comes to backend in full
stack development Django is a clear
winner now it is a high level python
framework that enables rapid development
of websites
it is also free and open source and has
a huge active community of users
so I really suggest you get your hands
on Django and work on it extensively
moving on let me give you a brief
overview on the trends in 2020 first up
is blockchain
now blockchain is an emerging technology
and has seen tremendous growth in the
last few years now it has also entered
into domains like healthcare and finance
next up is AI and chat boards AI is
booming and there is no doubt in that
so languages like Python and JavaScript
Frameworks at tensorflow are widely used
mobile app development this is one of
the top trends you should look out for
in 2020 now there are mobile
applications for practically anything
these days so Frameworks like react
native and flutter can be deployed to
develop these applications
next up is Progressive web applications
now these are like a hybrid of mobile
and web apps they are faster to load and
provide some amazing features like push
notifications
another important feature is their
ability to work offline
lastly we have iot with the increasing
number of devices getting connected to
the internet every second development of
iot applications is also on a rise
so these were a few trends that you
should look out for in 2020
moving ahead let's look at the salary of
full stack Developers
now according to pay scale the average
salary of a full stack developer in
India is around 5 lakhs 90 000 rupees
per annum
the average salary of a full stack
developer in the U.S is around 75 000 US
dollars per annum
all right so moving on to the fun part
let's go ahead and look at a simple quiz
now here is a quiz question
which of the following is not a
JavaScript framework or a library
option A react
option b angular
option C pandas or option D View
so let us know your answer in the chat
section one lucky winner will get a
voucher
so I'll keep this on the screen for a
while
mind you which of the following is not a
JavaScript framework or a library
so comment your answer immediately
all right
so moving ahead let me tell you how
simply learn can help you
now there are several online
certification courses but if you're
looking for something that is concise
and well structured then head out to the
simply learn website and here you can
see a few options you have the full
stack Java developer Masters program you
have the full stack developer.net
Masters program
and you also have full stack web
developer mean stack Masters program
you can also go through the overview
and depending on your requirement you
can choose the appropriate course
hey guys I'm sure you all have heard
about phrases like web development full
stack development front-end and back-end
development
but if you are not sure about what
exactly they mean or how they're
different then don't worry you're in the
right place
this video on front end versus back-end
development will help you differentiate
the two
but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our Channel already make
sure to hit the Subscribe button and the
bell icon to never miss an update
now let's Jump Right In and look at
what's in store for us
so first we look at what exactly web
development is
then we look at the different types of
web development
going ahead we'll look at what front-end
development is and understand what
exactly back-end development is
and lastly we'll be comparing the two on
the basis of languages libraries and
Frameworks skills job roles and salary
so now let's begin by understanding what
web development is
web development is the process of
creating a website on the internet
it refers to the non-design aspects of a
website such as creating features and
functionality using programming markup
and scripting languages
developers concentrate on the technical
aspects of web development such as
architecture programming application
integration and graphics
now let's look at the different types of
web development
now web development could include the
front end and the back end
now together
they form something called as full stack
development now I'm sure you're
wondering what they actually mean so
let's go ahead and understand them
let's begin by understanding what
front-end development is
now front-end development is a part of
the website that codes and creates
front-end elements of a website which
are features that are directly viewable
and accessible by the client
essentially a front-end developer is in
charge of everything you see be it
styling Graphics text alignment
navigation colors Etc and the attempts
and he attempts to improve the user
experience to make it as seamless as
possible
now these front-end developers also
contribute to the overall design and
aesthetic along with debugging
responsiveness and performance are the
two main objectives of front-end
development
then what exactly is back-end
development
you guessed it right now web development
that occurs at the back end of programs
is accurately termed as back-end
development
now this back-end development covers
server-side web application logic and
integration and activities like writing
apis creating libraries and working with
system components as opposed to
front-end development which focuses on
customer facing services and programs
now back in developers create code that
allows database and an application to
communicate with each other
essentially a back-end developer handles
what you don't see we are in charge of
the back end of the website which
includes servers databases and
applications
so now that you have a brief
understanding of what front-end
development is and back-end development
is let's go ahead and compare the two
so we'll be comparing the two
based on five different features that is
languages libraries and Frameworks
skills
job roles and salaries
now let's begin with languages
now front-end development typically
includes coding using languages like
HTML CSS and JavaScript now as you all
know HTML is a markup language that is
standardized system for tagging text
files to achieve font color graphics and
hyperlinks now CSS is used to format the
layout of these web pages
and JavaScript is used to create
interactive elements on the web page
when it comes to backend the languages
include python C hash Java Perl PHP Ruby
and some JavaScript now Java in
particular was built from ground up to
run on the server side so Java is
extremely useful python is also one of
the most popularly used languages and
c-sharp language is the preferred
architecture for backend programming in
Windows environments
now talking about libraries and
Frameworks front-end libraries and
Frameworks include react.js angular view
jQuery and bootstrap while talking about
back-end Frameworks we have expressed JS
node spring Django flask JSF
asp.net and dotnet MVC
now front end and back-end developers
work very closely so it's helpful to
have a foundational understanding of
front-end developer Technologies like
HTML and CSS as well
moving on to skills now front-end
developers are in charge of bringing
visual elements to a website as well as
interactive elements such as navigation
buttons and anything else that improves
overall usability
HTML JavaScript and CSS are frequently
used to ensure that a site's visual site
operates well so it's crucial to know
these languages and a good understanding
of JavaScript Frameworks and libraries
is also essential
and other General skills include a good
grasp of front-end programming languages
the ability to create a responsive
design the knowledge of testing and
debugging and an understanding of
front-end development tools like
automation content management Version
Control Systems
talking about the skills required for
back-end development
now back-end developers deal with
back-end languages and Frameworks like
Java Ruby and rails Etc
now back-end developers deal with
languages like Java Ruby on Rails Etc to
make web pages and applications operate
now it's vital to know commonly used
back-end languages and Frameworks like
Django node.js Express JS and so on
other important skills include database
management framework utilization
programming knowledge of accessibility
and security compliance and
understanding requirements and ensuring
data consistency and integrity
now moving ahead let's look at some of
the job roles for front-end and back-end
development
talking about front end we have the
front-end developer the CSS or HTML
developer we have front-end web designer
we have front-end SEO expert full stack
developer and a UI developer
talking about backend this back-end
developer Java developer full stack
developer devops engineer
software engineer and an iOS Developer
and lastly let's look at the salaries
offered to these front-end and back-end
Developers
in India the average salary of a
front-end developer is around 6 lakh
rupees per annum
while a back-end developer earns about 7
lakh rupees per annum in the US a
front-end developer earns around 100 000
US dollars per annum while a back-end
developer earns about 121 000 US dollars
per annum Mission will be about today's
topic which is become a front-end
developer so let us begin
we are going to discuss the things you
need to know to become a web developer
first we will start with basic skills
which every web developer must know
before moving into more advanced web
Frameworks then we will understand what
react is and why it is so popular after
that we will go through another web
framework called angular
then we will also get to know about a
comparatively new front-end framework
called view in the end we will go
through the front-end developer salary
Trends which will give you an Insight of
the job market
so without further Ado let's get started
first the basic skills let us understand
what basic skills are required to become
a web developer there are a few
recommendations in that you must learn
for either path these are the common
things every programmer should know
the first one is the GitHub
so git is a free open source version
control system that enables
collaborations in a particular project
it is designed to handle both small and
large scale projects git is a tool used
to save code and create different
versions to better manage the feature
updates in the product or an application
so followed by the GitHub the next
important thing we have is today
structures and algorithms a data
structure is the location used to store
and organize data an algorithm is a
collection of steps to solve a
particular problem
learning data structures and algorithms
allow us to write efficient and fast
computer programs
so followed by data structures and
algorithms we have the text editor get
familiar with the text editor of your
choice
Visual Studio code is the top choice for
most of the web developers and my
personal choice too because of the large
support of languages and of course the
speed
the text editor is where you write all
your code and the terminal is where you
execute it
so followed by the text editor we have
the command line the command line is an
important tool to get familiar with
it is how you run your code after
writing it on a text editor
the better you are on the command line
the more efficient you will be asked to
developer
so followed by the command line we have
the HTTP and https the HTTP protocol is
the backbone of the internet
it handles requests and responses from a
web application it is mandatory for a
web developer to have good knowledge of
both HTTP and https in order to build
fast and responsive web applications
now that we know what basic skills are
required to become a front-end developer
let's discuss about the most popular
front-end library that has to react
now what exactly react is
so react as a front-end JavaScript
library used for building beautiful user
interface components
it is an open source meaning it can be
used in your commercial projects without
any restrictions
it is also component based and these
components can be used again and again
promoting code reusability
it is an MVC or model view controller
architecture react is the V responsible
for how the application looks and feels
for the end user now why should you
learn and react react has always been in
high performance as it uses virtual Dom
rather in real Dom so basically Dom
stands for document object model and is
used by every internet browser for
rendering a web page or an application
react can also be easily integrated with
other JavaScript Frameworks like node.js
resulting in the development of a
completely new web application including
front-end and the backend
it is comparatively easy to maintain
large scale applications written in
react because it highly promotes code
reusability and code readability
so followed by react the next important
thing we have is the angular
we have an idea of what react is but it
is not the only framework used for
building user interfaces so now let us
know about angular
so now what exactly angular is
angular and light react is a fully
fledged framework for web application
development which usually does not
require additional libraries for
implementing additional functionalities
like routing
it is also open source and backed by
Google and as regularly updated
resulting in constantly improved
performance and addition of new features
in terms of performance it respect to be
much slower than react but with the
recent versions performance seems to be
on par with react
now why should you learn angular angular
is one of the most stable Frameworks out
there it is also the most complete
meaning you don't have the need to
integrate with other Frameworks since
it's pretty much includes everything for
the web development of a complete web
application
angular backed by Google is safe choice
for using in long-term projects since it
is not going anywhere anytime soon
angular is obviously used by Google for
its web applications and also used by
other large-scale companies creating a
lot of job opportunities now followed by
angular the next one we have is the view
now that we know quite a bit about the
two popular front-end Frameworks namely
reactant angular let's now go ahead into
view and learn a bit more about view.js
Library
now what exactly is View
ERS are lightweight and open source
Progressive JavaScript framework used
for developing interactive web user
interfaces
integrated with other libraries to
develop a complete web application
like react vue.js is mainly focused on
The View part of the web application and
hence its bit faster when compared to
angular which has a complete web
application solution
view.js is commonly referred to as View
and pronounced as vue.js or view is
rightly so
now why should you learn View
any beginner web developer can easily
understand View and start building their
own web user interfaces
like react view also uses virtual Dom
result again better performance and it
also uses the component based code
design promoting code reusability and
code readability
vue.js has become popular in recent
times and many companies are starting to
use it owing to its lightweight
performance and easy integration with
other web libraries and Frameworks
now with this let's move into the next
section where we will discuss about the
front-end developer salary trends now
that we know what skills we need to
become a front-end developer let's now
have a look into the cell regions of a
front-end developer
front-end developers are always in high
demand since new web applications are
launched and managed continuously
there are generally offered General
salaries across the globe
the salaries also depend on the factors
like Frameworks skills and the work
experience the average salary of a
front-end developer in India is 5 lakh
6000 rupees per annum the average salary
of a front-end developer in United
States is 76
929 US dollars per annum
website architecture website
architecture basically defines the
design and structure of a website a
website contains two important parts the
front end and the back end the front end
of any website is something the user
came across we can also state it as the
client side of any website whatever the
user of the website sees while going
through any particular website is
considered as front-end
HTML CSS and JavaScript are the three
most popular and mainly used
Technologies which are responsible for
the development of the graphical user
interface
the combination of these three
Technologies is responsible for giving a
smooth and appealing user experience on
the other hand anything the user doesn't
witness while going through the website
but actually exists somewhere in the
website and the server is known as the
backend of a website
whenever we visit a page and send a
request for the content the server goes
through the database and then creates a
response that is sent back to the
browser the browser then interprets the
response and displays the content on the
screen
several Technologies are used for
backend development few of them are
JavaScript Frameworks like node.js and
next.js python Frameworks like Django
Ruby Frameworks like Ruby on Rails C
plus plus Frameworks like Apache and
many more other Technologies let's move
ahead and we'll now go through what HTML
is
HTML stands for hypertext markup
language
introduced in the year 1993 by Tim
bernersley the same person who invented
the world wide web in the year
1989. the first version of HTML was
written in 1991 but released later in
1993 as HTML 1.0 HTML got many updates
with time and the current ongoing
version of HTML is HTML 5.0
HTML is also known as the most basic
building block of the web which is used
to create the structure of any website
with the help of numerous predefined
tags it helps the browser to understand
the structure and style of a document or
file for viewing over the internet
it allows our web pages to host videos
images and other applications it also
facilitates navigation within web pages
or between websites through hypertext
hypertext refers to the links present in
any website to collect different web
pages and create a whole website
HTML has a lot of use cases web
development HTML code is used to design
how a browser displays web page elements
such as text hyperlinks and media files
internet navigation users can easily
navigate and insert links between
related pages and websites as HTML is
heavily used to embed hyperlinks web
documentations HTML makes it possible to
organize and format documents similarly
to Microsoft Word
moving on to the installation part HTML
does not require any special software to
work if you have notepad installed in
your system that's enough to start using
HTML
the best part about HTML is its ease of
use
let's move on to the editors part now
and we'll then download a particular
editor for a complete HTML playlist an
editor or IDE which stands for
integrated development environment is a
software application that comprehends
facilities to a programmer for software
development
just like Photoshop makes it easier to
edit photos in the same way IDE makes it
easier for a programmer to write code
the number of Ides present in the market
today is huge
some of these editors are notepad plus
plus atom and vs code
these editors are free to use on the
other hand editors like Sublime are free
but with some limitations
to access all the features of sublime we
have to go for the premium version for
the license and then we can use it for
software development my personal choice
for an editor is the visual studio code
there is a reason behind using vs code
as an editor let me tell you a few
advantages of vs code over other editors
first of all it is free to use as it is
open source software so we can get it at
no cost it supports multiple programming
languages there's nothing like we need
any web support or work on different
editors for different programming
languages we can use vs code for
different languages as well extensions
are also one of the main reason behind
using vs code suppose we want to use a
programming language it does not support
all we have to do is to add an extension
and we are good to it also does not
affect the editor's speed as it runs as
a different process
besides all these properties one main
key factor behind using vs code is its
availability in different platforms like
it is available for Mac Linux and
windows
so I think there are enough features we
have discussed till now there are many
more features that we'll discuss while
installing and working with vs code
let's start with the installation part
now
the installation process for vs code is
pretty simple just go to Google and
right here
vs code
press enter and the next page which will
open will show us the results click on
the first link over here and we are here
at the website of vs code right now you
can see the download button in front of
your screen you can click on it and you
can download the stable version for your
operating system from here only or you
can go to the other download button
present at the top right corner of your
screen
click on the button over here
so you can see here we have all the
extensions as well these are the top
extensions we have to download them
inside vs code once the downloading part
overs so here you can see the download
Starts Now sit back and relax until the
download finishes once the download
completes open the setup file from your
downloads and it will take us to the
license agreement page now agree over
here click on next and it will take us
to the browser part so here what we have
to do is we have to choose a location
for the vs code file to locate so you
can choose any location so for now I am
clicking on next over here now you can
see we have
a different folder so we can click on
browse and then select it and then click
on next so here we can see we have some
additional features so what we'll do is
we'll create a desktop icon now you can
see Adam
options as well so click on them as well
click on next and now click on install
the installation will start once we are
done with the installation part click on
finish and the vs code will start
automatically fine so here you can see
we have the welcome page over here what
we can do is we can open a folder from
here so if you have any folder so what
we can do is we can open it from here
now what we'll do is we'll create a new
file so here you can see we are in a
file what we have to do is we have to
save this file now so click on file
click on Save and now we can save this
file at any place or any location we can
see so what we are going to do is we are
going to go on desktop we are going to
create a new folder over here we are
going to name it as HTML now inside HTML
what we are going to do is we are going
to write here the name of our file so
we'll write your first then we'll write
here
the extension so what we have to do is
we have to write here first dot HTML and
here you can see we have an HTML file
over here right so you can see we have
four options over here the first one is
for opening a folder or any particular
location so click on open folder now
what we are going to do is we are going
to open HTML over here and you can see
we have the HTML folder open now we have
the file over here as first dot HTML
which we created recently then we have
the search button over here to search
anything or to replace anything
the next button we have over here is for
the source control then after this we
have the debug Button as well and then
we have the extension so these are the
features vs code provides us and below
here we have the accounts option and the
settings option what we can do from here
is we can change the font size and
different settings right
now the next button we are going to
discuss is the extensions button here we
can find many extensions given by the vs
code Studio Community they are free to
use
so for now we'll use these two or three
extensions so what we can do is we'll
click on HTML CSS support so you can see
I have already installed these
extensions over here so then we have
JavaScript and type script nightly and
the live server extension so this
extension is pretty important the live
server one and the HTML CSS you can
leave the JavaScript and type script
knife please for now so we have to
install these two extensions for now
so I have already installed you can
install them in your computer now the
next thing we have to do is
so we can start writing a code here on
I've already told you that while saving
any file make sure that we are saving
that file with the dot HTML extension
so what we have to do here is we have to
put an exclamation mark over here and
press enter and you can see we have the
basic HTML code which we'll need in
almost every part we can simply start
with it if we have basic computer
knowledge we got you covered if you are
a newbie to HTML please stay connected
with us and you guys will understand
HTML in a very fun and exciting way
before we go through the different tags
present in HTML let's discuss what are
Terriers a tag refers to a special word
wrapped in angular brackets which are
used to define a particular type of
content on a web page after using a tag
in an HTML file the browser decides how
to render or display the content on the
screen the list of tags present in HTML
is pretty huge we'll go through some
basic tags in today's video and we'll go
through the remaining tags while working
with them so let's start with the most
basic tag we have in HTML you can see
here we have a basic program written
over here all the tags mentioned over
here are mandatory for all HTML programs
the first thing we have here is the
doctype as HTML you can see it over here
we have written doctype HTML so this is
not an HTML tag but an instruction for
the system about the type of document
basically we are telling the system that
this is going to be an HTML document so
that all the browsers can know that this
particular document is an HTML document
and work accordingly
the next tag we have here is the HTML
tag you can see the HTML tag starts from
here and goes till n right we have ended
this HTML tag at the end of our HTML
document
now this tag is necessary for all HTML
documents if you are working on an HTML
document then this tag is what we are
going to need
the HTML tag represents the root and the
end of the whole document this is a
container tag that contains all the
other tags within it so this tag is
pretty mandatory in all HTML documents
now the next tag we have here is the
head you can see the head tag over here
and the ending of this head tag is
present over here we have certain tags
present inside this particular tag now
you can see that this head tag contains
meta tags and the title tag right you
can see the meta tag over here we have
three meta tags and then we have a title
tag as well
Now The Meta tags doesn't appear on the
page itself but only in the pages source
code meta tags are essentially little
content descriptors that help search
engines what a web page is all about
now the next tag we have here is the
title the title tag is used to define
the title of a web page basically we
write the name of our web page inside
this step for example if we see here the
title of a web page is document form if
we change the title of this HTML
document and write here something like
first document
fine now save the program open it with
live server now you can see it over here
that the window name is changed to first
document there is no change in the web
page itself so what we are going to do
is we are going to reduce the size of a
vs code and the browser we are going to
keep them side by side here
so that any changes we made in this HTML
document are reflected in the web
browser
other tags we can use inside the head
tag are the style tag the script tag and
the link tag now the link tag is used to
link any external CSS file to HTML page
we have to provide the source of that
file and then any styling changes we
make in that particular file will get
reflected in the web
for that so let's create a CSS file
first what we are going to do is we are
going to create another file over here
let's name it as
style dot CSS now this particular file
has dot CSS as extension this will tell
the browser that this particular file is
a CSS file and we are going to use it
for styling purpose
fine so we have this style.css over here
now we are going to link this with our
HTML document for that what we have to
do is we have to write here
link so this is the tag now we have to
write a Rel and we have to write here
style sheet fine
now the next thing we have to do is to
provide the source code of this
particular file so for that we are going
to use href href is going to be style
dot CSS now close this link tag now this
rail tag over here specifies the
relationship between the current
document and the link document
now you can see it over here we have
this Rel as style sheet this means that
this particular file is a style sheet
and we are going to use this for styling
purpose
another important tag we have inside the
head section is the script tab this tag
is used to declare or use any script
within the HTML document basically used
for JavaScript so it's not necessary to
use this tag within the head section
only we can use it anywhere but for now
we are going to use it inside the
headline the syntax is also easy we have
to write it like
script
SRC now SRC is going to be the file name
so let's add another file over here
we'll write first dot JS so this will
tell the browser that this particular
file is a Javascript file so we are
going to write here inside this now we
are going to write first dot yes now we
have to define the type as well so type
is going to be text and the file is a
Javascript file so we'll write here
JavaScript fine now close this tag and
the script tag will closes automatically
you can see it over here fine
the script tag is close
keep one thing in mind that we have to
close the script tag every time but the
link tag is not necessary to close
the next step we are going to discuss is
the body tag
the body tag defines the document's body
now you can see it over here if we go
back to HTML page you can see the body
tag over here now the body element
contains all the content of an HTML
document such as headings paragraphs
images hyperlinks tables lists Etc
there can only be one body element in an
HTML document any tag we are going to
use within the body tag is going to
define the structure of a web page
now the next tag we are going to use is
the heading tag there are six different
types of heading tags starting from H1
and go still H6 H1 refers to the most
important heading and H6 refers to the
least important the font size of H1 is
the largest and the font size of H6 is
the smallest among all so let's use them
all here what we'll do is we'll write
here H1 now inside this H1 we'll write
this is
heading 1 save the program and you can
see it over here we have a heading in
our web page which says this is heading
similarly we have the h2 tag as well so
if we write here H2 and inside this if
we write this is heading
to save the program you can see the
change in the font size you can see the
difference over here the font for H1 is
greater and the font for H2 is a bit
smaller than H1 similarly we have H3
and for H3 we are going to write here
this is
heading 6. 3 fine then we have H4 as
well so we are going to write here H4
and inside this we are going to write
this is heading
4. fine similarly we have H5 and H6 as
well so we are going to mention them
first here so we'll write here this is
heading 5 and finally we have
H6
which is used for heading 6 so we are
going to write here this is heading
6. fine save the program and you can see
the difference in all the headings over
here the size for H1 is the largest and
the size 4 heading 6 is the smallest we
can use any of these headings according
to all notes
similarly we have the paragraph tag as
well in HTML it is used to write a
paragraph or any content within the
webpage the syntax is simple we have to
use the P tag for that so if we write
here p and now inside this paragraph tag
whatever thing we'll write so let's say
we are writing here this is a first HTML
document
fine now save this program and you can
see it over here we have some text
present in the web browser right so
these are the most basic HTML tags we
discussed in today's video as we said
the list of tags is large and we'll
discuss them while working with them so
please go through these tags on your own
and let us know if you face any issue
we have already discussed about tags in
the last video we came across several
important tags in the previous video
like the HTML head and the body tags
a simple definition of tags states that
a tag refers to a special word wrapped
in angular brackets which are used to
define a particular type of content on a
web page
after using a tag in an HTML file the
browser decides how to render or display
the content on this screen right
now keeping this definition in mind the
definition of an element in HTML states
that an HTML element is the collection
of a start tag its attributes and antec
and everything in between the tags right
so an HTML element is basically a
collection let's understand this with
the help of an example
what we'll do is we'll right over here
inside the body of this HTML document
we'll write
P fine now this paragraph tag over here
is an example of a tag it has opening
tag and a closing tag so this whole
thing is a tag this paragraph is a tag
over here
now if we add an attribute to this tag
like an ID or a class so what we'll do
for that we'll write here let's say ID
is equals to
para one fine this tag now has an
attribute within it ID makes this whole
tag unique we can access the content of
this tag with the help of ID attribute
we'll discuss attributes in detail in
the upcoming video for now let's add
some content inside this tab so what
we'll do is we'll write inside this tag
we'll write over here let's say
this is a
paragraph fine so we'll write your
paragraph
so this is the content of a paragraph
tag now we have four different parts
present over here
we have the starting tag over here so
this is the starting Tech this whole
thing over here is the starting time
then we have attribute so ID here is the
attribute then we have content of this
tag so this is the content present
inside whole time and then we have the
end part of a paragraph tag so this
represents the end part
right so the combination of these four
things is known as the HTML element
now let's talk about the case
sensitivity of HTML tags so HTML tags
are not case sensitive so you can see we
have paragraph tag over here with small
P present inside angular brackets what
we can do is we can write here capital P
as well so these two things are pretty
same so let's write something inside
this as well so let's say we are writing
here this is
paragraph two fine so this is the
content present inside this paragraph
tag with capital P inside angular
brackets now save the program and you
can see we have two paragraphs over here
the first one says this is a paragraph
and the second one says this is a
paragraph two so what we have to do is
we have to remove a from here
save it now and now it says this is
paragraph two fine
so I hope you guys got that HTML tags
are not case sensitive
fine now let's move ahead and we'll now
discuss empty elements in HTML
most HTML elements have a start tag and
an end tag that indicate where the
element begins and where it ends for
example we have this paragraph tag over
here this is the start of this paragraph
and this is the end part right so this
indicates that this paragraph tag ends
over here
now there is a group of elements that
are exceptions to this rule so these
elements are called empty or void and
only have a start tag since they have no
content present inside the deck
so they must not have an end tag in HTML
example of empty elements are
like the Break Tag we have we have image
link and many more such tags the list is
quite long so what we'll do is we'll add
an image using the image tag so image
tag is basically an empty element
so we'll use that particular element and
you guys will understand what empty
elements are
so as mentioned earlier that empty
elements do not require any closing text
so what we'll do is we'll write here
inside angular brackets IMG is the tag
me
then we'll write a SRC so SRC over here
is attribute we'll discuss attributes in
upcoming videos so inside this will
provide the path over image so let's say
we have
this image present inside
images folder which is a folder present
in a system so where we are saving all
our HTML programs so
the next thing we'll write here is alt
alt stand for alternate so if the image
is not shown over the browser then the
alternate text will be shown so let's
say we are writing here image one
now we'll close this
image tag so that's all we don't have to
close this particular image tag we don't
have to write here like this
so you can see we don't have to write
here like this anything so if we not
write it away that's fine because image
element is an empty element so let's
save the program and you can see we have
an image over here in the browser so the
image size is quite large what we'll do
is we'll reduce the side so we'll write
here
just for now
we'll discuss all these things in the
upcoming videos so don't worry about it
for now you can see that we have an
image over here so this is our image
this particular image is what we have
added using the image tag
so this is done now the last thing we'll
discuss in this video is the nesting of
elements nesting means we can use the
tag or element within another element
for example you can see we have a
paragraph over here so this is a
paragraph which says this is paragraph
two let's add some more things over here
so let's say we are writing over here
tml stands for
hybrid text
backup language
fine
and save the program so this is the
paragraph over here you can see let me
increase the size of our browser a bit
so now I think you guys can see it much
better now what we'll do is we'll use a
particular element or tag within this
paragraph text so let's say we want this
HTML to be cursive and bold in nature so
what we'll do over here is we'll use the
B tag over here so b stands for Bool so
what we'll do next is we'll cut HTML
from here and we'll paste it inside this
B tag now save the program and you can
see HTML is bold in nature now right
similarly what we can do is we can Nest
one more tag inside this bold text so
what we can do is we'll write here I
now we have to
put this HTML inside both these texts
save this program and you can see the
HTML is cursive in nature now so you can
see we have three different texts or we
can say we have two different tags
inside a particular tag this is known as
nesting of elements so we can do it with
HTML as well I hope you guys must have
got an idea about what HTML elements are
and how elements are different from tags
in HTML
in the last part we came across HTML
elements we saw the difference between
HTML tags and elements now that we
already have an idea about elements
let's discuss what attributes are
let me write the basic syntax of an HTML
element over here first so what we'll do
is we'll write over here
let's use the paragraph tag so we are
writing over here
this is a
basic example
of elements in HTM fine I hope you guys
must have got an idea about what this is
this is actually a basic HTML element we
have nothing else over here just a
simple example of HTML element an
element consists of start tag and ending
Tech and the content within the deck
right so this particular thing is an
element
now attributes in HTML refer to the
additional Properties or characteristics
of an element for example if we write
here let's suppose we are writing over
here let's say we are writing over here
ID is
fine now save this program and you can
see over here that we have a paragraph
which says this is a basic example of
elements in HTML now we have this whole
element with IDs paraben or we can give
any idea of our choice now this ID is
unique for this particular element for
now you don't have to worry much about
this ID or any other attribute just
focus on what attributes are we are
going through the working of attributes
basically
so we can use the ID of this attribute
to style this particular element so
basically this ID attribute defines what
this HTML element is we have to use the
style tag element or we can say we have
to use the style element for styling
this particular paragraph you will
understand it once we go through the
text so let's do it over here what we'll
do is we'll use the style tag over here
so
we'll write yes type you can see this is
a style element basically it has start
tag it has ending text now we'll write
some content inside this particular text
so let's say we are writing over here
hash
parallel now inside this what we'll do
is we'll Define some styling properties
so let's say we are writing over here
background color is
red and we'll write here
color so this color here refers to the
font color basically so we'll write here
blue now save this program and you can
see the paragraph in a browser is
changed so what we did here is inside
this style element we access this
particular ID so ID is unique for each
element we will discuss it later on so
basically this particular paragraph tag
has an ID named parallel so we are using
that particular ID then we have some CSS
properties so these properties are used
to style a particular element so we have
used it over here you can see it over
here if I zoom out a bit in the browser
you can see the background color of this
whole paragraph is red and the font
color is blue fine what we want to say
here is this idea over here is basically
an attribute it is used to identify or
change a particular element we have many
attributes present in HTML so we'll go
through some of them let's say we are
adding an image over here so let's add
an image and you guys will understand
about HTML attributes here as well so we
will write here IMG so this is basically
an empty element we have discussed it in
the previous part wherein we went
through HTML elements now what we'll do
is we'll write here SRC now SRC is also
an attribute this attribute is used to
provide the system with the source of a
image so if we go back to this
particular HTML folder so here we have a
HTML folder you can see we have a folder
here named as images and we have an
image present inside this particular
folder right so what we have to do is we
have to provide this path inside a HTML
file so what we are going to do here is
we are going to get back to vs code and
inside here we'll write images so this
is a folder name and we have a file name
html.png present inside that particular
folder so SRC is the attribute and this
particular thing is the value of our
entry right now the next thing we are
going to do here is we are going to
write here alt now inside this alt let's
say we are writing HTML over you now
this alt attribute is used when we add
an image only so basically what happens
is when we add an image to our web
browser sometimes what happens is the
image is not shown over the browser so
in that case the alternate text will be
shown so if this particular image is not
shown in the browser then this
particular text will be shown so let's
save this program we'll open a web
browser here side by side as well you
can see that this particular image is
present over here in our web browser the
size of this image is quite large
we can change the size in two different
ways we can either use the ID attribute
here as well and then use that
particular attribute in The Styling tag
or css file to change the size of this
image or we can simply use the height
and width attribute in the image tag
over here so that's the simple one so
what we are going to do is we are going
to write here
height height is an attribute we have to
define the height in pixels so we have
written over here 300 pixels save the
program and you can see the height of
this image is 300 pixels now same thing
goes for width as well if we write here
width and if we Define the width Test
300 pixels as well save the program and
you can see now the height and width of
this particular image is 300 pixels
right
so guys this is all about the basics of
attributes in HTML I hope you guys
understood this will go through each
attribute while working on those
attributes in the upcoming videos so
don't worry about it if we haven't
covered all the attributes over you
we'll go through them in the upcoming
videos before we move on and discuss the
different formatting tags in HTML let's
understand what formatting is formatting
refers to the process of making the text
present on a web page more appealing to
the user for example let's say we want
to add a heading in our HTML document
and for that we want a specific font
size let's say we want to add a heading
with a bigger font size
for this purpose we have the heading tag
present in HTML which provides us with
six different font sizes with H1 being
the tag with the greatest font size and
H6 with the smallest one we have already
discussed in in the previous videos as
well now we need to make sure which font
size we want and we can use the heading
tent accordingly let's understand this
with the help of an example let's
suppose we are working on a web page
wherein we want a heading so let's say
the heading is what is HTML
we want the font size to be bigger so
simply we'll write here
H1 we have already mentioned it that H1
has the biggest font size of all the six
heading tags right so inside this we'll
write what is
HTML so let's suppose this is the
heading now on saving the program you
can see here on the browser that we have
a heading with larger font size
so what we can do for now is we'll
remove this heading from here now save
it and you can see we have only one
heading as of now we have the heading as
what is HTML we can also write a
paragraph after this heading tag that
will explain what HTML is using the
paragraph so let's do it over here as
well and you guys will understand it
much better
so here we are going to use the break
element so this is basically an empty
element used in HTML for line break so
what we are going to do is we are going
to put it over here so this is the tag
BR tag or Break Tag we can see now what
we are going to do is we are going to
write here inside the paragraph tag
HTML stands for
let's write it in capitals we'll write
here hyper text
markup
length fine
so here we have paragraph that says HTML
stands for hypertext markup language now
what we want to do is we want to add
another heading to this webpage which
will Define the uses of HTML so
basically what we are doing is we are
going through the sizes of heading text
so we want another heading let's say
over here
now the main heading of our web page was
what is HTML and we wanted to stand out
among all the headings present in our
webpage that's why we use the H1 tech
for that adding now for the next heading
or for the new heading we'll have a
little bit smaller size than the main
area so what we are going to do is we
are going to use the h2 tag or the H3
tag for that so let's use the H3 tag for
now
we'll write over here H3
so basically we are going to write it
after a br tag so we are going to use
the BR tag over here or the Break Tag we
can see now we are going to write here
uses of
HTML fine now save the program and you
guys can clearly see the difference in
font size of both the headings let me
zoom in a bit here in the browser so now
you guys can say it much better there's
a difference in the size of heading 1
and heading 3 right so this difference
is what we are talking about till now
there are six different sizes for a
heading tag in HTML we can use any of
these heading tags according to Ernie
figure out which one of these six tags
is best suitable for your web page and
use them simple and easy
let's move ahead and we'll now discuss
some more formatting tags present in
HTML let's move ahead and we'll now
discuss some more formatting text
present in HTML the next tag we are
going to discuss is the Bold Tech this
tag is used to make the text bold or
stroke
so there are two different tags for the
same task for making the text bold we
can either use the Bold tag or simple B
tag we can say the other tag we can use
is the strong name the functionality of
both tags is similar so we'll use them
side by side so that you guys can see
the difference or they are basically
same so what we are going to do is we
are going to write here after this BR
tag we are going to write here B so b
stand for voltage now we are going to
write something in here so let's say we
are writing over here HTML
now again after BR tag we are going to
use the
strong fine we'll write same thing here
the content will remain the same so we
are going to write HTML over here
now here we used both tags with similar
content present inside save the program
and you can see we have two similar
outputs here on our web page the outputs
are exactly similar the working of both
the tags is the same right
now let's recall the nesting of elements
in HTML from the previous preview we
have said earlier that we can use an
element within another element in HTML
we are going to Nest this bowl tag
inside of first paragraph tag it means
that we are going to
Nest this bold tag over here so what we
are going to do is we are going to use
bolt tag
inside the full form or we are going to
put the full form of HTML inside the
Bold tag fine
so save it
and you can see we have hypertext markup
language written over here in the
browser in bold right it looks better
than the previous one
just like the Bold tag we have two more
text present in HTML to make the text on
screen look more appealing to the user
the italic tag and the underlying tag
now you guys must be thinking that these
three formatting techniques are also
present in Microsoft Word you are right
these three tags are present in both Ms
word and HTML the working is also same
so let's use these tags here once what
we are going to do is we are going to
use this text over here
so we are going to put this hypertext
markup language inside three different
tags so we are going to put them inside
italic we are going to put them inside
bold and we are going to put them inside
underline as well so we are going to do
this over here
now you can see the nesting of elements
over here if I zoom in a bit on Visual
Studio code you can see we have a
paragraph 10 then we have three tags
present inside it so we have bold Tech
we have italic and underline so this is
called nesting of elements
now save this program and you can see
the text over here we have hypertext
markup language in italics it is
underlined and it is bold in Niche right
the next tag we are going to use is the
delete tag we have two different tags
present for this task as well let's say
we want to put a line through the center
of any text Crossing it out basically
let's say that this text is not relevant
fine so let's go through an example
first what we are going to do is we are
going to use the brake tag over here and
now after this braid tag we are going to
use a paragraph tag we are going to
write a paragraph So
let's say we'll write here I would like
to have a cup of
coffee fine save it and you can see we
have this paragraph or sentence over
here on the browser now what we want is
we want to delete this particular word
or we can say we want to put a line
through it fine so what we are going to
do is we are going to write here
strike
fine we are going to put coffee inside
this strike tank because we want this
particular word to cut
and then let's say we are writing over
here D fine so save it now and you can
see it over here it says I would like to
have a cup of coffee has a line over it
and then we have written t so you guys
can understand the meaning of this
sentence by yourself I guess
you can use this tag anywhere according
to our needs we can achieve this same
thing with the help of the delete tag as
well what we have to do is
we have to write here
in place of strike what we are going to
do is we are going to copy this piece of
code from here
we are going to paste it here now
instead of strike we are going to write
here delete so d e l this is the tech
and we are going to close this tag as
well now we are going to write coffee
inside it
and save the program and you can see we
have the exact same output with this tag
as well
fine
another tag we have in HTML for
formatting is the market now the mark
tag in HTML is used to Mark any
particular text the text will be
highlighted with yellow color for
example
let's say we are writing something over
here
or we can just paste this again and we
are going to remove this part
now we want to Mark the word coffee
let's say so what we are going to do is
we are going to write a mark this is the
tag and inside this tag we are going to
write
coffee let's say fine save the program
and you can see it over here we have
this sentence which says I would like to
have a cup of coffee and coffee is
highlighted over here right
so this is the mark tag and we can use
this tag for formatting
now the last tag we are going to discuss
in today's video is the fontech the font
is an inline element used to change font
sizes font colors and font styles of the
text in a web page this element has its
own attributes so the three attributes
we can use are size color and freeze
fine size is used to change the font
size of the text we can write values
between 1 and 7 with 1 being the
smallest and 7 being the largest font
exactly opposite to The Heading text so
you can learn it that way color refers
to the font color we can simply write
the name of the color or we can use the
hexadecimal values for colors black side
decimal numbers are specified according
to the RGB value for each color
the last thing we have is trees face
refers to the font style the default
HTML font is times new ROM we can use
any font style offer Choice using this
attribute so let's use this tag over
here and you guys will understand it
much better I guess so what we'll do is
we'll write here
let's say we are using a paragraph tag
so we'll write something over here let's
say I prefer
now we are going to use the font tag
over here so this is a tag you can see
it in red color now we have three
different attributes right so the first
attribute we have is 5 so we'll write
here inside size size let's say the size
of this font support then we have color
so color defines the font color so let's
say the font color we want is red
and then we have the face so let's say
we want the font style to be
and we'll write
something over here let's say we are
writing this over red fine
now save the program and you can see it
over here it says I prefer red fine so
let's complete this sentence what we are
going to do is we are going to write
something after this font tag as well so
let's say we are writing over here red
over blue save the program and you can
see it over here
that we have this particular sentence
which says I prefer red over so let me
increase the size of vs code so that you
guys can see it clearly so here you can
see we have this paragraph tag then we
have written inside it I prefer and we
have kept this red word inside a
particular element font element
basically this font element has three
different attributes size color and face
now let's change the size of this to 6
for now
and we'll
check the output save the program and
you can see red over here is quite large
in size right it looks different so I
hope you guys got this formatting in
HTML document is mostly done using CSS
but now HTML also allows us to format
our documents using different tags basic
formatting we can say so formatting is
making the web page more appealing using
these particular tens so the list of
format index present in HTML is quite
long we can't discuss all of them here
but if you use any of those tags in the
upcoming videos then surely we'll
discuss them over their own now the task
for you guys is to use these formatting
tags and let us know if you find any
difficulty in using them in HTML a
phrase tag is used to give structural
meaning to a block of text
what does that mean let's try to
understand this with the help of an
example we'll first take a paragraph for
this example a small one maybe so let's
do it here what we'll do is we'll write
here
P so we are going to use the paragraph
10 let's write something over here so
let's say we are writing over here hello
everyone
then I'll write this is
caution and let's suppose we are writing
over here
please subscribe to our
YouTube channel fine
save this and you can see here that we
have the same paragraph here on the
browser
now what we said earlier about the
phrase tags is they are used to give
structural meaning to a block of text
right
so here we have a paragraph and we want
to provide meaning to a block of text
let's say we want to put some emphasis
on the word YouTube over here fine
we want this word to stand out
differently from the rest of the
paragraph for this task we have the
emphasize tag in HTML
the Syntax for this tag goes like this
so what we'll do is we'll cut this
sentence into two different parts so
that it will be easy for you guys to
understand now
we have the emphasize tag in HTML the
syntax is pretty simple what we have to
do is we'll write over here
so we are going to make changes inside
this particular paragraph tag only so we
are going to use the emphasis tag over
here
so what we have to do is we have to cut
the word YouTube from here and we have
to paste it here now the syntax is so
simple we have a two word tag so it says
em it stands for emphasis now save the
program and you can see here in the
browser you can see the difference
basically the word YouTube stands out
from the rest of the words present in
the paragraph to lay some more emphasis
on the word YouTube we can use the title
attribute now title attribute will be
used inside the emphasis tab so let's do
it here once so what we are going to do
is we are going to use the title
attribute over here so let's say the
title says check a
YouTube
Channel fine so let's break it a little
more
so here you can see we have these three
lines
so inside this paragraph tag what we are
doing is
we are using the emphasis tag and inside
that emphasis tab we are using the title
letter fine
on saving the program you can see
nothing changes over here on the browser
to witness the change here we have to
take our mouse cursor over YouTube and
you can see we have a small pop-up here
that contains the value of a title
attribute let me zoom in a bit here so
here you can see on taking the mouse
cursor we have this small pop-up with
the value of a title attribute right
another thing we can do for this task is
we can add a link over here on the word
YouTube we'll discuss it in the upcoming
videos when we'll go through text links
in HTML so you guys will understand it
much better then now you guys may have a
question in your mind that we can do
this exact same thing with formatting
tags as well right yes of course we can
do that but formatting refers to the
process of molding the text for a better
look and feel of the text while face
tags are used to provide meaning to a
block of text it's not necessary that if
a tag falls under the category of
formatting text then it can't be a
phrase tag the difference lies in the
purpose of using that particular text I
hope you guys are getting it
the next tag we are going to discuss is
the mark Tech we have already discussed
this tag in the formatting tags as well
so let's discuss it one more time the
mark tag in HTML is used to Mark any
particular text the text will be
highlighted with yellow color so we have
discussed it previously now what we are
going to do is we are going to copy this
piece of code
so we are going to copy the whole
paragraph from here and then we'll paste
it here now instead of using the
emphasis tag we are going to use the
mark type over here fine
so we are going to change the tag name
from emphasis to mark for the opening
and closing time save it now and you can
see we have another paragraph over here
which is almost the same or which is
exactly the same it says hello everyone
this is caution please subscribe to our
YouTube channel now the thing to notice
here is the word YouTube it is
highlighted in yellow color right so the
title attribute will work same over here
as well if we put a mouse cursor over
the word YouTube you can see we have
this pop-up with the same title value
right
so one thing to notice here is the title
attribute is basically the
differentiator between the formatting
tags and the phrase tags it means that
the tag Remains the Same but the way of
using it defines the purpose
so let's move ahead and we'll now
discuss the abbreviation tag in HTML
the word abbreviation in general terms
refers to the short form of a word
that's it we have the answer here if you
are using any abbreviation for any word
we want the user to know that this
particular word has a special meaning
then we can use the abbreviation
so the syntax goes like this what we'll
do is we'll again use the same paragraph
and we'll
paste it over here again
so what we are going to do is
we are going
to remove this empty space from here so
that you guys will be able to see the
whole code or as much code as possible
so what we are going to do now is we are
going
to use the abbreviation tag fine so
we'll remove this piece of code from
here we have to put this over the word
YouTube so what we are going to do is we
are going to write a abbreviation and
inside there we are going to write y so
this is the short form of YouTube
basically
now save the program and you can see
that we have another paragraph but
there's no difference over here as of
now the word is simple there is it's not
standing out basically right so this is
because while using the abbreviation tab
we must necessarily use the title
attribute along with this type so let's
do it here
we have to write here title and we have
to write Here YouTube because YT stands
for YouTube so we are going to write
Here YouTube
now save the program and you can see
here that the abbreviation YT is now
underlined with a dotted line fine this
indicates that the word y t is used as
an abbreviation here and the user will
know that something is different over
here on taking the mouse cursor over it
you can see we have the value of our
title attribute you can see it says
YouTube
so this is basically the short form of
YouTube YT over here
now the next tag we are going to discuss
is the address tag this tag is used to
display the address in the web browser
the content is written within the
opening and closing address tag is
considered as an address in HTML so this
is the address we generally use fine not
an IP address or nothing else the
general address we use for our location
or for a address
so let's use this tag over here we'll
write here
address and this is the tag now inside
this tab we are going to write
YouTube office let's say
then we have
one two three
so this is going to be the street name
for our address then we have let's say
sector so let's say the sector is four
five six
fine then we have
the place name is Noida and the country
name is India fine
so this is an address and let's save the
program you can see here the difference
in the browser the address tag over here
has a different font this tag is used to
indicate that this particular block of
text is in address so you can see it
over here this is our address now if you
want
see it clearly let me remove these three
paragraphs from here save the program
now and you can see we have address over
here so if you want to write it in
different lines so what we can do is we
can use the break tag over here
then over here again save the program
and you can see we have the address over
here the font is different that's the
only difference between address tag and
other text
the next tag we are going to discuss is
the short quotation tag this tag is used
to add double quotes within a sentence
the syntax is simple so what we'll do is
we'll write something over here let's
say we are writing over here paragraph
We Are
writing over here let's say again please
subscribe to uh
now we want the word YouTube inside
double quotes right so for that we are
going to use the quotation tag this is
the syntax we have to write simple queue
and we have to put the word
YouTube inside it and then we'll write
here
Channel and we have to put a space over
here save the program and you can see it
says please subscribe to our YouTube
channel with YouTube present inside
double quotes fine
so the last tag we are going to discuss
in today's tutorial is the code tag in
HTML this tag is used to represent
programming code in HTML the text will
look like we have any code from a
programming language for example
will write here code this is the tag now
inside there will write
let's say we are using a for Loop in
JavaScript so we'll write here for I is
equals to 0
then we have
I less than
3 so let's give some spaces over here
and then we have I
plus plus fine
then after this we have
inside here
console.log and we are going to print hi
fine so if you are new to this language
just ignore it it's just a simple piece
of code from JavaScript so save it now
and you can see we have this code over
here now what we are going to do next is
we are going to use braid tag over here
first then we'll
understand it fine
so we are going to use the BR tag here
again and here
again fine save it now and you can see
the code now
you can see we have the same output on
the browser as the text present in vs
code the font is exactly the same so
this represents a piece of code in HTML
we can use the code tag for that
so Guys these are some of the basic
phase tags we discussed in today's video
as we mentioned earlier that the list is
quite long for all these texts we'll
discuss them in future whenever we use
them I hope you guys got it till now we
have covered different types of tags
present in HTML we came across the
formatting tags and the phrase tags
present in HTML in the last part we also
covered the differences between these
tags apart from all the differences
these tags are they are still similar in
one aspect that is these tags are used
to change the appearance of a web page
whenever we use these tags we change the
look and the feel of a web page
Now The Meta tag is a bit different from
these tags this tag does not impact the
appearance of a web page it is used in
the head section of the HTML document
and does not require any closing tag to
work
what this tag does is it gives
information about the data we have on a
web page meta refers to metadata
metadata means data about data for
example if we have a website that
provides the user with some data it can
be any kind of data and the user can go
through it to gain some information
but the information about the data
present on our website is given by
metadata only
what does it mean to provide data about
data for example if we go to Google and
search for a keyword now how Google
works is it goes through the keywords
present in any particular website and
then choose the user that particular
website those keywords here refer to
metadata and we have to put them inside
meta tags in HTML the description we get
while searching for a website is also
present inside the meta tag of any HTML
document
basically what we are trying to say is
this tag is used to give essential
information about any particular web
page
meta elements can be used to include
name value pairs describing properties
of HTML documents for example if you
want to put any keyword for a web page
the name attribute inside the meta tag
will contain the keyword and the value
attribute will contain the actual
keyword name
there is no closing tag needed in meta
elements because these elements contain
information within attributes only we
can use multiple meta tags for different
information
an interactive web page cannot be
created with just this structure so you
will employ adding Technologies like
JavaScript and CSS to bring interaction
and Beauty to your HTML respectively
that's where CSS comes into picture
making web page Pages attractive is made
easier with the help of CSS often known
as cascading style sheets
the style and experience of a web page
are handled by CSS the color of the text
the font style the spacing between
paragraphs the size and arrangement of
columns the background pictures or
colors used layout designs differences
in display for various devices and
screen sizes and a variety of other
effects can all be controlled using one
single language which is CSS although
CSS is simple to grasp and Loan it
offers strong control over how an HTML
document is presented to the user it
depends how you are presenting your HTML
document how you are styling it because
the user will get an impression on the
first view itself
CSS is most frequently used in
association with HTML or xhtml as markup
languages
now when it comes to front-end web
development of any web page the three
most widely used Technologies are HTML
CSS and JavaScript
HTML is used to create the structure of
a web page CSS makes it look more
attractive to the user by adding styles
to it and JavaScript adds interactivity
to the web page
so let's move ahead and now we'll
discuss the advantages of using CSS
the first one is time saving CSS is a
time saving since you can create it once
and reuse it across a number of HTML
pages there's a style available for each
HTML document or we can say each HTML
element that you can select and apply to
as many different websites as you desire
if you utilize CSS instead of manually
writing HTML tag attributes each time
Pages load faster you can only you only
need to create one CSS rule per tag and
it will be applied to every instance of
that element so quicker download times
results from less code
simple maintenance to make a
modification that affects all elements
on all web pages just modify the style
sheet everything will update instantly
also CSS provides a great range of
characteristics than HTML so that you
can provide a considerably better
styling experience
CSS provides a considerably wider range
of properties as well than HTML so can
you can give your HTML page a much
better look than you can use using HTML
attributes meta Styles than HTML
now style sheets enable the material to
be optimized for multiple types of
devices allowing for multiple device
compatibility different versions of a
website can be displayed for printing or
for handheld device devices like pdas
and cell phones by using the same HTML
document
so let's move ahead and now we'll
understand how CSS actually works
a browser must merge the content of a
document with its style information
before displaying it
it goes through several steps to process
the document which we have outlined you
remember that this is a greatly
simplified explanation because different
browsers will perform the procedure
differently when a browser loads a web
page but this is what usually takes
place in a browser the browser starts
losing HTML example it receives it from
the network
it transform the HTML into a document
object model in the computer's memory
the document is represented by the
document object model in the same time
it also loads CSS as well most of the
resources that the HTML document links
to including embedded images videos and
even connected CSS are subsequentially
fetched by the browser because it is
handled a little later in the process we
are not discussing JavaScript here to
make things easier for you guys
the browser parses the CSS that was
fetched and groups the various rules
according to the type of selectors they
use such as element class ID and so on
it determines which rules should be
applied to which document object model
nodes based on the selectors it
discovers and applies the appropriate
styles to each node as needed
this immediate step is called render
tree so this is the creation of Dom tree
after the rules have been applied to it
the render tree is organized in the
manner in which it should look the
screen displays the pages visual
represent representation
this stage is called painting So guys
this is how CSS actually works on web
page I hope you guys must have got an
idea about what CSS is and why one
should use CSS on a web page we'll dive
deeper into all CSS Concepts in the
upcoming videos so we'll go through all
the CSS aspects one by one CSS uses the
color values to specify the colors on a
page they can be specified using
predefined color names hex or RGB format
there are nearly 140 standard color
names hexadecimal is a 60 degree
representation of a color the first two
digits RR represents the red value the
next two are green value and the last is
the blue value
all the other colors can be created
using the combination of these three
colors there are several websites
available where you can know the hex
value of the different shades of color
as you can see the black color is
signified by hashtag and the six zeros
the red is hashtag FF and the four zeros
followed by it the RGB color value is
specified using the RGB property this
property takes three values one for red
green and blue the value can be the
integer between 0 to 225 or a percentage
as you can see the black color is
signified by zero zero zero the red by
25500 the Blue by zero zero 255 and the
green by zero to fifty five zero now
let's move to an example to understand
how we can add the colors to our page
in this example we will see how we can
add colors in different ways to our HTML
so we are on the Sublime Text Editor as
you can see we have the standard
boilerplate ready with an H2 and a
paragraph on our page open the style tag
and make the font size of the paragraph
to 25 pixels so it is clearly visible
let's start by adding colors to our text
just by color names HTML supports nearly
140 standard color names
we'll make the color of the paragraph
green for that just type color and set
the color to Green
as you can see our paragraph is changed
to Green
let's try one more
this time we will add the color red
just refresh
as you can see the color is not changed
to red
there are nearly 140 HTML standard
colors that is supported by the web
browser
you can also add colors using the RGB
format there are many websites available
to know the RGB or hex value of the
desired color one such is HTML codes.com
as you can see in the HTML course.com we
have the hex value and the RGB value of
the desired color
let's try one
we'll add this color with the RGB value
171 229 and 27 to our paragraph So for
that
just type RGB and the color code you
want
as you can see the color is not changed
to our RGB value let's try one more
this time we'll use this RGB value to
our text
you can see the colors changed to our
desired value
in this way you can use the RGB format
to change the colors
the next way is using the hex values
hexadecim is a six digit representation
of a color the first two digits are red
next one to a green and a last are the
blue value let's see how you can use the
hex values
as you can see the hex value for this
color is hash31787f
we'll use this value to our text
to add the hex value you have to use the
hashtag followed by the color code
you can see that color is changed to a
hex value let's try one more
you can see the hex value for this color
in hash F14 a07
just copy the desired value to your file
you can see the color changes
you can also add color models to our
heading do that just mention the Border
style along with the color code
we'll add the Border color red to our H2
now you can see we have the border
around our S2
I hope you have understand how to use
the color values to your web page there
are mainly three ways by which you can
add the colors to a web page their hacks
RGB values and the color names in the
last two sessions
we have discussed what is CSS and the
CSS color property in this session we
will discuss how you can set the
background image on your web page
we'll see the several properties related
to background image and how you can use
them to customize the image around the
web page
so without further delay let's get going
so let's begin by discussing about the
background property of the CSS
the background image property specifies
an image to use as a background of an
element
the background is defined in the body
element of the HTML code
to add a background image on an HTML
element use the HTML style attribute and
the CSS background image property and
mention the path of the image inside the
URL attribute there are several
properties of the background that are
used to define the image on a page some
of the common ones are background image
background repeat and background
position
by default the image is repeated so it
covers the entire element
let's switch to the text editor and see
how we can add the background image to
our page so we are on the sublime
texturator let's start by opening a
style tag
the background image is always set on
the body tag so type body and open the
curly braces
the background image is always set on
the body tag so open the body tag with
curly braces and start typing background
image
use the URL value of the background
image to set the path of the image
make sure the image is in the same
folder as of the HTML file here we have
our file nature3.jpj
so mention the path inside the double
quotes
save the file and let's see how it looks
on a web page
as you can see we have the image on the
web page let's format this image a
little bit we'll start by setting the
background size so type background size
and there are three values to the
background size first one is Auto
it will set the image as it is
save the file and let's see how it looks
on a page
as you can see the size of the image is
as same of the original size
the color value will set the image size
that will be fit to the web page
as you can see the image is set to the
whole web page
we can also set the image size to manual
let's say we want the image size of bit
500 pixels so
now as you can see the width of the
image is 500 pixels next we will set the
background repeat property there are
three values to background repeat first
is no repeat with no repeat value the
images will not be repeated on a page
now as you can see the images are not
repeated
second is repeat X it will set the
images to be repeated on the x axis
as you can see the images are now
repeated on the x axis similarly repeat
the images on the y-axis
as you can see the images are not
repeated to the y-axis and there is a
default value repeat which will repeat
the images on the web page
so let's keep it to cover
so let's keep the background size to
cover and set the background repeat to
no repeat
let's save the file and look it on our
web page
now as you can see the image is fully
put to the web page
let's add a text above our image to see
how it looks like
so I'll add a paragraph tag and type
some random text here
let's set the text color to red and
align it to Center
I'll type P and open the curly braces
I'll set the color to red
and I'll set the text align to Center
let's save the file and see how it looks
on a page
as you can see we have a text above our
image which is centrally aligned and the
text color is red in this video you will
learn what are CSS selectors and what
are their different types so let's start
by discussing the agenda for this
tutorial so in this tutorial we will
learn what are CSS selectors and what
are the different types we will also
look at an example to how to work with
CSS selectors
so what are CSS selectors
CSS selectives allow you to select and
style HTML elements selectors are used
to find elements based on their ID
classes types attributes value of
attributes and much more let's discuss
the most common selectors there are
several different types of CSS selectors
the most common of them are CSS element
selectors CSS ID selector CSS class
selector CSS Universal selector and CSS
group selectors so what is the CSS
element selector
the element selector selects element
based on the element name
this is a CSS selector it means it will
select all the P elements on the page it
will style all the P elements to the
central align having blue color
this is a CSS selector
it is set to P this means it will select
all the P elements on the page it will
style all the P elements to be Center
aligned having blue color
let's look at what it looks on a page
so as you can see all the elements are
centrally aligned with the text color
blue
CSS ID selector
the ID selector uses the IDU attribute
of an HTML element to find the specific
element
an idea should be unique within the page
so you should use the ID selector to
find a single unique element to find an
element within a specific ID use a hash
character followed by the ID of the
element
so here we have used the hash Paragon so
all the rules will be applied to the
HTML element with ID equal to para1 so
this is an ID selector
it will be applied to all the HTML
element with ID is equal to para1
as you can see it is applied to the
element having the ID Paragon and all
the other elements are defaultly styled
CSS class selector the class selector
finds the element with a specific class
set by the HTML class attribute to
select an HTML with a specific class use
a period character followed by the name
of the class so this style will be
applied to all the elements having the
class name class 1. this is a class
selector it is denoted by a period
symbol all the elements having a class
named class 1 will be styled with
centrally aligned and color blue
as you can see the element having the
class name class 1 is tiled and all the
other elements are set to default CSS
Universal selector
the universal selector selects all the
elements on a page the universal
selected is assigned by a star character
the universal selector selects all the
elements on a style sheet as you can see
it is denoted by a star Mark all the
elements inside our web page will be
centrally aligned and the color will be
set to Blue as you can see all the
elements are centrally aligned and the
colors are set to Blue CSS group
selector
in stylesheets there are often elements
using the same style to minimize the
code you can group selectors to group
The selectors separate each selectors
with a comma here we have group
selectors for H1 H2 and P
so style is applied to H1 H2 and P
elements only
it is better to group The selectors to
minimize the code
here we have group selectors P H2 and H3
so style will be applied to only element
having P H2 and S3
as you can see so all the elements of P
H2 and S3 are centrally aligned and
colored to red
every element that can be displayed on a
web page is comprised of one or more
rectangular boxes CSS Box model
typically describes how this rectangular
boxes are laid out on a web page
these boxes can have different
properties and can interact with each
other in different ways but every box
has a Content area and options
surrounding padding model and margin
areas
the following diagram demonstrates how
the content padding border and margin
CSS properties determine how much space
and element can take on a web page
the content area consists of content
like text images or other media it is
bounded by the content Edge and its
dimensions are given by the content box
width and height
the Border area is the area between the
Box padding and margin its dimensions
are given by the width and height of the
water
the margin area consists of spaces
between the border and the margin the
dimensions of the margin area are the
margin box width and margin box height
it is useful to separate the element
from its neighbors
the padding area is the area
that includes the elements padding this
area is actually the space around the
content area and within the Border box
its dimensions are given by the width of
the padding box and the height of the
padding box
now let's jump to an example to
understand the Box model better
so we are on the sublime techno to get
started I have created a box theme
simply run background color pink the
font size 30 pixel and we have set the
border to zero solid green
let's see how it looks on our page
so as you can see we have a box name
simply learned with background going all
the way to the end
I have also removed all the padding and
margin from the page so that the boxes
are pushed just at the corner of the
page as you can see
let's start by adding a padding of 20
pixel to the Box
if you save the file you can see the Box
increased by 20 pixel from all the sides
Paddy characters inside the background
of an element it goes around the content
of the element most of the buttons
inside the CSS be designed using padding
so that the background of the button
becomes wider than the actual text
the next thing you can do is change the
border of the element if you change this
border size to 15 pixel we will get a
nice solid background of color green
the Border goes around the padding of
our element so we have the 20 pixel of
padding around our content and 15 pixel
of border around the padding which is
around the content
now we'll see the working of the margin
if you add 30 pixel of margin to an
element you can see the spacing on the
outside of our border
so let's add the 30 pixel margin and
refresh
you can see the spacing on outside of
the Border module is used to space two
elements apart from each other
now let's change these values to see the
difference
let's make the margin 40 pixels
we'll make the padding 30 pixels
and let's keep the Border 20 pixels and
make it color red
this is pocket pixels
let's observe the changes
so as you can see our border now has a
red background the padding is 30 pixel
the margin is 40 pixels let's inspect
the elements to understand it better
inspects you can see the different
styles here in the computer tab you can
see the Box model
this is a Content area this is the
padding area this is the border and this
is the margin area
we have the margin of 40 pixels around
the border so you can when you click on
this area you can see the margin gets
highlighted
the body area gets highlighted of 20
pixels this is the padding and this is
the content
you can change the size of the content
by adding the height and weight
so let's try adding height and width
we'll give the height 50 pixels and will
give the width also 50 pixels
just save the file
now when you refresh you can see the
content Area 15 to 50.
what is a flex box
flexbox also called flexible Box model
is basically a layout mode or model that
provides an easy and clean way to
arrange the items within a container
if you are using a CSS for a while you
must have used the old block model where
you assign width in terms of percentage
or fixed width and then use the float to
arrange the items on the page
suppose for example you want to earn
three boxes in a row
then you have to enter everything
manually from width height and to
padding flexbox can do all these things
with ease
some of the concepts of flexible Box
model is the ability to alter the item
width and height to best fit in the
containers available in the free space
Flex model is the direction agnostic
which is different from the Box model
which is vertically biased and the
inline which is horizontally biased
flexbox works for both
flexbox is more effective in a small
scale layouts
so here are the main properties of the
flex
okay
so let's jump to some code and learn how
this Flex properties work
okay so we are in the Sublime Text
Editor to get started let's add a div
inside our body here and we'll give a
class of flexbox container since this
will be the container where all our
flexbox item will decide
then inside this container we will add
another div and give it a class flexbox
item and one more class flexbox item one
which will help us to understand which
items we are referring to when we style
our elements individually
foreign
let's just save the file and see how it
looks on a page
now if you save the file you can see we
have the box because I have already
applied some of the styles to these
flexbox items let's just see the styling
so you can see we have the items tiled
just a basic styling so that we get the
Box on our page
now let's just copy these and add two
more flexbox items and you will see we
have two more boxes on our page
just copy and paste them below
give them the class name flexbox item 2
and flexbox item three
just save the file
now you can see we have three boxes on
the page
Now to create a flex container we will
add display Flex to our Flex container
and this is how we create a flex
box container
so here we will just add
display Flex
just save the file
now you can see all the items are at the
same height and they are all in the same
row you will also notice that if you
shrink our browser the items adjust
themselves accordingly to fit within the
browser
now if you want to style the elements on
the main axis we will use the property
justify content inside of flexbox
container let's make it a center
save the file
now you can see that all the elements
are in the center of the page
another thing we can do is if we want
our layout to have a spaces between the
elements we will set the justify content
to space between
you can see all the items are evenly
spaced if you want to lay out your items
on the cross axis we will use the Align
items property
the default value for this is stretch
if you want to keep the size of our
items we will use the center and then
all our items will be Center vertically
before flexbox aligning the items
vertically inside the container was
nearly impossible with flexbox you can
do it easily
now you can see the items are aligned
vertically inside the container now
let's just delete everything and we'll
just keep the display flat
now if you want to have a column layout
instead we will use the flex direction
and change it to column select Direction
column now if you refresh the page you
will see all the items are shown up in a
column
now we can start talking about the
different properties that can be applied
to our different flexbox items as
opposed to a flexbox container items the
flexbox contains only for laying out and
spacing between your items as well as
the positioning of your item inside the
container
the actual flexbox item properties are
used to override those item Properties
or to apply different sizing to these
elements now if you want a first item
that it does not shrink when you shrink
your browser we'll set the flex shrink
to zero to our first item
so we'll set the flex
shrink to zero
now if you go back to the page
and try to shrink this
you'll see the first item Remains the
Same it does not shrink
now in the same way you can set the
items to grow in proportion with the web
browser suppose we want our Flex box
item to to grow with the as the page
grow and cover all the empty spaces so
we'll set this Flex grow to 1.
now you will see the all these empty
spaces are taken by the second item
let's say we want a second box to be the
center of the container instead of
stretching to full height we can use the
Align self property and set it to Center
now you will see that the alliances
properly overrides the Align content
property of the container
you can see it is centrally aligned
so this is all you need to understand
and get started to work with the flex
boxes
I hope you guys enjoyed this video and
learned something new about the flexbox
and how you can use the text box to
create the dynamic layout for your site
what is a grid
a grid is a set of intersecting
horizontal and vertical lines defining
the rows and columns
and what is the grid layout
so CSS grid layout is the most popular
layout system available in CSS
it is a two-dimensional system meaning
it can handle both columns and rows and
like flexbox which is largely a one
dimensional system
you work with grid layout by applying
the CSS rules to both the parent element
which become the grid container and the
elements children which became the grid
items
the CSS grid layout excels at dividing a
page into major regions or defining the
relationship in terms of size position
and layer between parts of a control
built HTML Primitives
you can see this is the basic layout of
a grid system
like tables grid layout enables an
author to align elements into columns
and rows
however many more regular layouts are
either possible or easier with CSS grid
than they were with tables for example a
grid container's child element could
position themselves so they actually
overlap and layer similar to the CSS
position elements
so here are the features of the CSS grid
layout
they are fixed and have flexible track
sizes you can create a grid with fixed
track sizes using pixels
for example this sets the grid to the
specified pixel which fits to the layout
you desire
you can also create a grid using
flexible sizes with percentages with the
new FR unit designed for this purpose
you can place the items into a precise
location using the grid line numbers
names over targeting an area of the grid
the grid also contains an algorithm to
control the placement of items not given
an explicit position on the grid
you can define an explicit grid with a
grid layout the grid layer specification
is flexible enough to add additional
rows and columns when needed
features such as adding as many columns
that will fit into a container are
included
it also gives you control of overlapping
content
more than one item can be placed into a
grade cell or area and they can
partially overlap each other
this layering May then be controlled
with the Z index property
so here the basic terminologies you
should know to work with the grid system
better
the grid line is a dividing line that
make up the structure of the grid they
can either be vertical or horizontal and
decide on either side of rows and
columns
a grid column is a space between two
adjacent vertical grid lines
the size of a grid column is determined
with a grid template columns property
on the other hand a grilled row is a
space between
two adjacent horizontal grid lines
its size is determined with a grid
template rows property
the grid cell is a single unit of a CSS
grid
and in Grid design a gutter is basically
the width of the space between columns a
guitar margin is this white space formed
by the adjoining inside margins of two
facing phases in a book or space between
columns on a page
so with this let's now move on to the
Hands-On demo and see how the grid
system works in actual world if getting
your learning started is half the battle
what if you could do that for free visit
scale up by simply learn click on the
link in the description to know more so
we are on the Sublime Text Editor open
with a project with some basic
background Styles and nothing inside the
body
you can see this is a basic background
style we have pre-applied this will have
a good look of the Box model
we'll start by creating a container and
wrapping our grid items in it so let's
create a grid and give it a class name
grid container
and inside of it we'll put our different
grid items so we'll just create
different grid items and give them a
class grid item followed by a clock
number they belong to
so that we can easily distinguish
between them
thank you
just copy paste this
five times
so we'll have the five elements on our
page
let's save the file and see how it looks
on the page
so you can see we have the different
grid items on the screen so there's an
easy for us to visualize we have not
applied any styles to them other than
the visual styles
so we'll go back to our code
let's go back to the CSS styling sheet
so to create the grid we'll open a
stylesheet we need to display grid on
our grid container so we'll select the
grid container and set the display to
grid
it is saved now
you will see nothing changes this is
because the gray itself doesn't Define
any rows and columns for us to work with
it just they give the alignment properly
therefore by default it looks just
exactly the same to make the grid look
actually great we want you need to do is
Define columns and rows for a grid
so to do this you will use a set grid
template and set the column if you want
to set the size of the column we'll set
the size to 100 pixel and 150 pixel
now
if you refresh you have the 100 pixel
column on the left and a 156 column on
the right and then the grid captures our
next row
but what if you want a box to flexible
size themselves according to the items
inside of them here we'll use a fraction
in it so instead of a 150 pixel column
we want one fraction of our size and
instead of 100 pixel we want the two
fractions of our size
so we'll just replace with two fractions
and this with one fraction
now if you save the file and go back to
the page
you will see the items on our left here
in our first column are twice as the
largest item on the second column
and that's because of the FR unit we
have defined
you can see the difference in the sizes
item one is the twice the size of the
item two
another thing you can do is with columns
is use repeat
suppose you want four Columns of a size
100 pixel wide you can just write repeat
command and inside of it how many times
you want to repeat the size
so we will just delete this
and use the repeat
we'll set the number of times we want to
repeat and the size of the
columns
now if you save the file we will see we
have a four Columns of 100 pixel wide
we can do the same things for row just
set the grid template
rows and Define the size you want
foreign
all around our container
if you don't know how large your grid is
going to be you can use the grid Auto
rows and this will determine the size of
all the rows that is added after the
template rows suppose we want all our
rows to be 100 pixels
so we'll just delete the grid template
rows
and set the grid Auto rows to 100 pixel
now you can see all the rows are now 100
pixel tall
let's change our column back to 100
pixel and 150 pixels
so that it will be easier for us further
we'll just delete this grid Auto rows
now we'll talk about the spacing of the
rows and columns apart from each other
we can do this with the help of the grid
grab property grilled row Gap will give
some spaces between the rows similarly
the grid column will give you the spaces
between the columns
now you can see the gaps between the
rows and columns
now we want the same value for both The
Columns you can use a grid grab property
and mention the space
we'll just delete these two
and instead of it we will use just the
grid Gap
and set the
size to 20 pixel
now you can see the evenly spaces
between the rows and the columns
this is all you need to know about the
sizing of the different columns and rows
now let's talk about the positioning
items within its grid cells
so for horizontal positioning we could
use the justify items and we can set
that to Center
so that centers each item within the
cell
by default it is set to stretch
you can also set it to start
or end
or space around
foreign
we will leave this to Center
to vertically position the content we
could use the Align items
the Ally items also accept the same
values
we can set it to Center
we can also set this one to start or end
just we'll keep this to Center as well
you can also align the entire grid
within the container
so let's get rid of these to just
demonstrate them in a proper manner
we could use a justify content and that
will align the content horizontally
within the container
foreign
you can also set this to start or to end
just set this back to Center
to align the content vertically we could
use the Align content and the Align
content also accepts the same value we
can set it to Center
for start
let's inspect the elements
you can see they are aligned centrally
between the container we'll just close
this
okay so this is everything you need to
know to get started with the grid layout
grid works very similar to the flexbox
but it allows you too much in terms of
laying your elements because of its 2D
nature here you can see we already have
the HTML file with us
in this video tutorial we are going to
create the structure of a form with the
help of HTML and then we are going to
style it with the help of CSS
so before we begin with the programming
part let's discuss what is a form
basically forms are very essential part
of any website it is a way to take users
input and process the data acquired from
the user
the form offers controls for almost
every use of an application
with the help of form controls and
several form fields we can take small as
well as large input data from the user
and then we can use that data you guys
must have seen it in different websites
where we have login and signup forms so
in login form what we usually do is we
enter a email and a password or a mobile
number and a password a combination of
any of them and then the website allows
us to
open account or for that particular
website on the other hand on a signup
form we need different type of data we
need name with then we have to put a age
and several other form of data right
like the phone number email everything
we have to put in a registration form so
these are the types of registration from
we usually see but apart from that we
can create other forms as well
so let's discuss why CSS is necessary to
create a form
as we all know HTML is used to structure
a web page so with the help of HTML we
can create a form but to make the form
look more interactive to the user we
need to style it that's where CSS comes
into picture CSS is used to style a form
and it will make a form look more
interactive to the user as well
so without any further delay let's start
with the programming part and we'll
create a basic form with the help of
HTML and CSS in this video so don't
worry we'll create some more forms in
the upcoming videos so we'll in this
particular video we'll see how CSS is
used along with the form so here you can
see we are in the HTML part of
form so we'll create a form first so the
most basic element HTML element to
create a form is the form element
now we are going to take some unordered
list or the UL element now we are going
to take the LI so you as you guys all
know
ul and Li both the elements are used in
combination
always so let's label
the form
so we'll write label 4. we'll take
certain parameters
and we'll write here name
fine this is going to be the name
we'll write your name save it and just
refresh the page so here you can see we
have the name present owner
web browser so the next thing we are
going to do is we are going to create
some more input Fields right so to
create an input field we have to use the
input element always so we'll write here
input we have to Define type type is
going to be text and then we have to put
a name name is going to be ID so ID is
going to be the name
and then we'll write here
user name fine
so here you can see we have an input box
let me just increase the size a bit so
here you can see we have our input box
with name as the label and then we have
an input box so similarly we'll create
some more input elements first so we'll
just paste them here for four times so
you can see we have four different
placeholders so just let's just remove
this one and we are going to keep it
simple for this particular video so
we'll write here label for mail then we
are going to
take email from the user so we'll write
here email
and input type is equals to we'll write
here email
ID will also mention is
mail let's say and name we are going to
write here user
email fine so save it here you can see
now we are going to do the same for
another one so here what we'll do is
we'll
right here
message so we are going to
label this as message we are creating
another input field so we'll write here
input type is equals to okay just let's
just do one thing let's just remove this
input tag from here and we are going to
use the text area in place of it so
we'll write here text area IDs let's see
message
and then we have to write here name
user underscore message fine
close it and the text area is done so
here you can see we have our text area
as well we have two input fields and a
text area so we are going to create a
form out of it right so we have all the
HTML elements now what we are going to
do is we are going to create a we are
going to style this form basically so
before that let me just create a button
as well
okay so we'll write here
button
type is equals to submit
and we'll write here
submit fine save it and here you can see
we have a button as well so let's move
to the CSS part of this form now so what
we are going to do is we are going to
style this form with the help of CSS now
we already have the structure of our
form so to style this form we are going
to use certain IDs or we can say
elements name or whatever we want to use
we can just use them so first of all we
are going to Center the form on the web
page so we are going to let me just show
you in this way so here you can see we
have all the HTML elements present on
the left side of our web page so we are
going to Center them first so we are
going to put them here
for that we are going to use basic CSS
so we'll write over here margin margin
is going to be 0 and Auto
0 for
up and down Auto for left and right
so then we are going to write here with
the actual width of our form so let's
say the actual width is going to be 400
pixel then we'll write here padding
padding we are going to write is 1M and
then we'll write here border border is
going to be 1 pixel
solid and let's use any color for this
form so let's just write here this
save it so here you can see we have a
border the border of our form so here
you can see our form is present at the
center of our web page it looks
different from what we had in our HTML
part right so we have about the all the
elements are present at this end let's
style it more
then we are going to Define the Border
radius border radius is going to be
let's say fun name
save it and here you can see the curved
border and we'll write here background
color background color
give any let's use Beach so here you can
see this background looks nice for this
form so we actually we are actually done
with the outer styling of a form we have
a form here now what we are going to do
is we are going to style these elements
as well so we'll write over here
you will and
list style type so we are going to
remove these bullet points from here so
we'll write over here none for the first
and here you can see all the bullet
points are gone then we are going to
write here padding is 0 and
margin is zero fine save it so here you
can see we are done with the unordered
list now we are going to write here form
Li and we are going to do it for every
list element so we'll write here it here
like this
we are going to give margin top
to every list element so we are going to
give margin top to every element so
let's say the margin top is going to be
1M so here you can see it's equal for
each element so the top margin is also
1M then we have a difference of 1M
between each input field right so that's
how it works now we are going to
style the label so we are using a HTML
element name right so here you can see
now what we are going to do is we are
going to align all the labels fine so
we'll write here display as
okay inline block save it and here you
can see
then we'll write here width as
90 pixels
save it so here you can see the width
it started taking the form of a form the
shape of a form basically then we'll
write a text aligned to the right
okay here you can see
now what we are going to do is we are
going to
take a input element
and text area together so we'll write a
text area as well
so we need to make sure that all the
text field have the same font settings
by default so what we'll do is we'll
write here font
1M
and we are going to use
since
review fine
let's just write something over here and
now save the program and here you can
see
so the font size is changed and the next
thing we are going to do is we are going
to give uniform text field size as well
so we are going to write here width as
300 pixels and then we have box sizing
property box sizing we are going to
write here border box
so here you can see all the boxes are of
same
width so here you can see the form looks
nice now
and the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to write here border
as one pixel
solid and
let's use this color
save it and here you can see the Border
changed
now what we can do is we can also use
the focus property of CSS to focus on
every input box but we are not going to
do it right now so the next thing we are
going to do is we are going to write
some code for the text area and we are
going to align it vertically so we are
going to write here vertical alignment
stop and here you can see the message is
now present at the top it looks nice
and we are going to give height as well
to the text area as
5m
and here you can see the text area is a
little bigger in size when compared to
name in email
now what we are going to do is we are
going to write here dot button
we are going to align the button with
the within the text field so we'll write
over here padding
padding left basically we are going to
declare it as 90 pixels and here you can
see
it looks nice
and let's just use 95 pixels here
maybe we can use 93 yeah it looks
aligned right so it the button is done
and we are going to just use the button
element here
margin left
0.5 m
M save it and yeah the form is we are
done with the form so this is the basic
CSS form so actually we used HTML to
create the structure and then we use CSS
to make it look a bit more interactive
than it was with the help of CSS so
don't worry guys we can do a lot of
things with CSS we can make a web uh we
can say form look more interactive way
more interactive than we can even think
CSS is actually interesting we can do a
lot of things with this form as well but
this time what we are doing is we are
going to see how CSS is basically
applied to a form to make it look more
attractive to the user so the background
color and all plays a vital role in
making a form at look attractive to the
user
so discussing talking about how actually
your form works so here you can see we
have three different input fields we
have name email and message just write
name over here
okay
and just let's write here caution and
message submit it and here you can see
it says please include and at the rate
in the email address because here in
HTML
we have used the type as email for this
input box
so how actually a firm works we create
the structure of a form with the help of
HTML then we use CSS to style and make
it look more attractive to the user and
then at the end JavaScript is used to
validate that particular form but now
HTML also provides some sort of
validation to any form with the help of
type and some other attributes so here
we haven't used JavaScript till now so
what will happen if we are going to
create a full flash form with backend
and front-end Booth we'll take input
from the user we'll submit it and the
data will be sent to the server and then
we can retrieve any data from the server
or we can submit the user data to the
server as well so HTML CSS and
JavaScript together comes together to
actually create a form this time we are
done with the HTML and CSS part we have
created a form and we have styled it
with the help of CSS JavaScript was
developed in the year 1995 by a person
named Brendan Ike Brendan was working
for Netscape Communications while he
developed JavaScript in 10 days
there were a few changes in the name of
JavaScript initially it was mocha which
was later changed to livescript and then
it finally became JavaScript the start
of JavaScript wasn't that good as so
many developers who were using Java at
that time
they considered JavaScript as a language
for designers and non-engineers no one
ever knew that this small side scripting
language would have a great future today
more than 90 percent of the websites out
there they are using JavaScript somehow
many of you guys gets confused with Java
and JavaScript let me clear it for you
that both Java and JavaScript they are
different languages they have almost
nothing in common many people say that
JavaScript was named after Java as a
part of a marketing strategy to gain
wider acceptance and recognition in 1995
Java was a buzzword when JavaScript was
developed that's why they renamed
JavaScript after Java let's move on to
what is Javascript
have you guys ever been through a
website where you can see images that
slides automatically one such website is
Amazon the home page of Amazon where we
can see different types of ongoing sales
is an example of JavaScript
in Layman language JavaScript is a
lightweight scripting language used to
make web pages more interactive and more
likely earlier when JavaScript was
developed it was only a side scripting
language to do basic tasks like you can
add pop-ups in your web page or you can
make your web page more interactive
nothing more than that but now the whole
scenario has changed with the help of
JavaScript we can create applications as
well
if we talk about applications let's take
an example let's suppose we want to
create an app we can create it in
Android or in iOS but we have to learn
few different languages to create those
apps for Android we have to learn Java
and XML and Swift We have to learn for
iOS but with the help of JavaScript you
can create hybrid applications which can
work on any platform without any problem
Tech giants like Google PayPal Amazon
and YouTube they are using JavaScript
these days the evolution of JavaScript
in the past few years was unbelievable
suppose you want to create a single page
website every one of us is familiar with
Gmail let's suppose so Gmail is a single
page website which looks more like a
desktop software than a website so Gmail
is based on angular.js it is a popular
framework by Google which is free of
cost and it is totally based on
JavaScript now let's go over some of the
features of JavaScript these features
are actually why it is considered that
using JavaScript is advantages over
other languages
so let's start some of these points
JavaScript is not a proper programming
language indeed it is a scripting
language
which works in the runtime environment
just like python so there are few other
languages like C plus plus and Java they
need a compiler to work but with
JavaScript you don't need a compiler
once you are done with the script it
will interpret and show you the output
in the browser directly next up is
lightweighted Javascript can provide
programming facility to some extent in
JavaScript you don't need to specify any
data type or return type which helps in
making development more quicker that's
why it is known as light weighted
JavaScript is both client-side as well
as server side technology client-side
technology runs on the user's computer
whereas the server side technology runs
on the web browser initially when
JavaScript was introduced it was
introduced as a client-side technology
but with the introduction of node.js in
2009 one can now work in the back end as
well
there is a way to validate the user's
Data before sending it to the web server
and we can do that with the help of
JavaScript the data will be checked for
correct form and value
all we have to do is start a loop give
it the condition
to check the data JavaScript is also
platform independent although originally
designed to work on browsers only but
now it is a platform independent
language which means once you are done
with the script you can use it on any
browser or platform without any problem
JavaScript is an object based scripting
language although many programmers do
not consider JavaScript as a true object
oriented programming language due to its
lack of class concept it does support
other features of object oriented
programming like it supports
encapsulation it supports polymorphism
and also it supports prototypal
inheritance
the last but not the least feature of
JavaScript is case sensitive so when it
comes to keywords identifiers names and
functions JavaScript differentiates
between capital and lowercase letters we
have to keep this in mind while
programming
now I will quickly go over some of the
JavaScript applications where JavaScript
is currently being implemented first one
that comes to every person's mind is web
development it was also the main motive
behind developing JavaScript we have
Technologies like angular we have
node.js we can create beautiful web
pages also JavaScript can be used along
with HTML and CSS to make those static
looking web pages more engaging if we
talk about other applications of
JavaScript we can use it in app
development either mobile app or web app
like we took the example before that how
hybrid apps made with the help of
JavaScript can take over traditional
Android and iOS app one of the most
important and unique application of
JavaScript is in smart watches the
bangle.js is an open sourced Smartwatch
powered by JavaScript Gordon Williams
the man who is currently working on this
project it is said that this new open
sourced stack built around JavaScript
will replace the onboard firmware soon
the next application of JavaScript is
client-side validation as we discussed
earlier JavaScript is used to validate
the user data whether the user's input
is correct or Not by cross checking it
with the given condition like the user
wants to enter in your website and you
want it to be a user with at the rate
gmail.com in his email ID so you will
give that condition to JavaScript and it
will cross check it with the user's
information like when the user will try
to enter in your website it will check
that if at the rate gmail.com is there
or not in the user's email ID
so it can validate the user also apart
from that one more application of
JavaScript is game development
JavaScript can be used to make fully
fledged 2D or 3D games using different
libraries although most JavaScript game
development focuses on creating games
used in browsers only let's start this
video with the introduction to Dom
Dom stands for document object model it
is an API for HTML and XML documents
which helps JavaScript to understand
what is their return inside the HTML
document API stands for application
programming interface to understand API
better let's take an example of a
restaurant
imagine yourself in the restaurant you
are sitting at the table with the menu
the chef in the kitchen is also part of
the system the waiter here works as a
messenger between you and the chef
that's what API does it works as a
moderator between JavaScript and the
HTML document
Dom defines the hold HTML document in a
hierarchical form to make it
understandable for JavaScript so that
other JavaScript functions can work over
it it represents the entire document in
the form of object and nodes
whether it be elements or text or
anything stored in the document the
entire page content can be accessed or
manipulated by JavaScript Dom is not
used with JavaScript only other
languages like python also uses dom dom
was designed to be used independently to
begin with dom there is nothing special
you have to do different browsers have
different implementation of the document
object model every browser uses Dom to
make the web page of the document
accessible by JavaScript let's move on
and see what is document object model
with the help of an example I believe
you guys have the basic knowledge of
HTML and CSS a prerequisite for this
course let's start things off with a
basic HTML example here we have a code
that consists tags like HTML head body
heading tag Etc we have the HTML tag
here the opening HTML tag and the
closing HTML tag inside the HTML tag we
have the head tag which contains the
documents header part inside the
headtech there is a title tag that
contains the title of the web page then
comes the body tag which contains a
heading tag and two div tags with IDs as
div 1 and div2 a div tag defines a
particular section in the HTML document
the ID used within the div tag it is an
attribute basically that has to be
unique within the document to make the
element unique from other elements next
up we have a paragraph tag with a class
attribute within it CSS and JavaScript
uses classes to select and access
specific elements don't worry guys if
you have no idea about it let us first
see the output of this code before going
to the document object model of this
whole document so guys this is the
output of the previous code we just came
through here we can see the title of the
web page as well as heading after it
there were two different div tags used
in the code here is the output of both
the div tags the question here is where
are those ID and class attributes seen
in the output the answer to this
question is there is nothing on this web
page that can show both of them we can
use them in our CSS file or through
JavaScript to specify the containers in
which they are used so we have concluded
how a normal document works and how the
browser interprets the HTML cool but how
JavaScript uses this code is a bit
different that's where Dom comes into
play when the actual HTML document is
loaded in the browser another
representation of that document is
created known as document object model
here's the model you can see on your
screen
each of the tags used in HTML document
is correspondingly represented as object
in the doll next starting from the HTML
tag and covering all the other tags like
head title body and few more the same
hierarchy as there was in the HTML
document goes with the document object
model also document to object model is
simply the same HTML document with
different representation the reason
behind this different representation is
that it's easy for JavaScript to
interpret this format JavaScript can't
understand tags but it can understand
these objects JavaScript can easily
manipulate these objects using different
functions which we will see in future
while working on these function for
example if you want to access the text
present inside the heading tag you can
do it by accessing The Heading tag with
JavaScript you can also work on the
style of this text with the help of
JavaScript as well JavaScript uses the
concept of nodes it can access nodes of
the document object model there are many
types of nodes present in the Dom the
basic three types are element node
attribute node and text node the element
node consists of all the tags used in
HTML document like the head tag and the
body tag the attribute node contains the
attributes used in HTML document by now
I hope you have understood the concept
of attributes so JavaScript can access
these attributes as well and the user
can work upon them as per requirements
the text here in the HTML document that
is simply it can also be accessed with
the help of JavaScript it is the value
of that particular element variables are
named storage that a program can
manipulate as the name suggests a
variable is a value that can change
according to conditions variables refers
to those memory blocks inside the
computer where we can store information
let's suppose you want to store any
value inside your computer so variable
will represent the location of that
value
in simple terms variables are cups with
stuff inside them and you can use that
stuff later again and again according to
the way you want to before the
introduction of es6 or ecmascript we can
say which is the updated version of
JavaScript variables were declared using
a single keyword only which is where
we'll try to declare a few variables
here we'll see how well keyword works
so let's comment this thing first
so let's declare a few variables let's
suppose where a equals to 15 will
declare
where B and the value of B will be 6 we
will declare where
C and the value of C would be a plus b
so here we have defined three variables
a b and c a is a variable with value 15
stored inside it and so is B the value
of B is 6 but C is a variable that will
contain the value of a plus b let's try
to print this on browser
document dot right
and we will print the value of C
save it and here you can see the value
of C is 21.
that's the correct answer so similarly
you can also print a and b as well let's
print a and b as well here
what we will do we'll copy this line
we'll paste it for a and
we'll update this here as well
so it won't create any confusion
so here you can see the value of C is 21
the value of a is 15 and the value of B
is 6. it shows the value of all the
three variables we declared but with the
introduction of es6 or ecmascript in
2015 two more ways were introduced to
declare a variable these are let end
const we shall discuss these two terms
in the later part of this session let me
show you how to declare a variable there
are a few things you have to keep in
mind while declaring a variable name
here we have seen we use three variables
a b and c that was an easy task to do
but giving a variable any name like
something other than a single alphabet
so you have to keep a few things in mind
while naming them start them with the
letter underscore or a dollar sign you
can't use any sign except underscore or
dollar so if you are giving a variable
name you can't use any other sign except
the underscore or the dollar sign you
can use these two signs only you can't
use any other sign
you can't use a number in the starting
apart from that let's suppose you want
to give it a name as 9be you can't do
that in JavaScript JavaScript won't
allow you this if you try to save it it
will throw you an error invalid or
unexpected token so you can't do this in
JavaScript there is no limit for the
length of the variable name but you
can't use reserved keywords in a
variable name like let's try to create a
variable with name as class class is a
reserved keyword in JavaScript we'll
save it and see here throws an error
unexpected token class but you can use a
class with capital c let's save it and
here it will work fine why it works
because JavaScript variables are case
sensitive if we try to create a variable
with same name Let's see we try to
create a variable with where girl and
the another variable will be where girl
with capital G this time JavaScript will
treat these two variables differently
these two are different variables for
JavaScript as JavaScript is case
sensitive when it comes to variables
let's declare a few more variables let's
remove it we'll declare a few more
variable let's comment this part as well
it will declare a few more variables
suppose we declare a variable with
keyword where and we'll name this
variable as bikening where byte name
and press enter
if we leave this variable without
assigning it any value the by default
value will be undefined let's try to
print the value of this variable
right we will try to print the value of
byte name
save it here you can see the value it
shows is undefined so the by default
value of a variable if you do not assign
it any value will be undefined
let's try to give it a value let's
suppose we try to give bike name
we use equals to operator to assign it a
value cosine let's suppose we'll assign
it Yamaha
semicolon and press Ctrl s to save this
and here you can see the output as
Yamaha you can also assign a value to
the variable during declaration as we
have done in the previous examples here
we have assigned the variables value at
the time of Declaration only let's move
on to let N const so we will discuss let
and Cones but first we will compare let
with where let is also used to declare a
variable just like where is used but
there is a limitation to use let
is not accessible outside the Block in
which it is declared
so we will use let here only let byte
name equals and we will change this
value as well we'll change it to Hero
let's say save it and here you can see
the output as hero but if we try to put
this code inside a block let's suppose
we put this code inside this block a
pair of curly braces and we will again
try to access document dot right we'll
try to access bike name again from here
from outside the block we try to access
this save it and here you can see buying
name is not defined it is an error in
line 18. so what's happening here
basically you can't access a let
variable outside the scope you can't
access it from here but it will work
with where if we try to replace let with
where and save it here you can see it
says hero and hero because first it will
interpret this method and then it will
interpret this as well in case of where
due to its limited scope light variables
are used when there is limited use only
like in for Loop or in while loop we
will learn these Loop in future let will
not allow you to redeclare any variable
let's understand this with an example
here's the code as well we have declared
where bike name and we'll remove this
and first we will try to do this with
where let's suppose where bike name
equals to TVs Control Plus s it says
hero and TVs so the variable name the
bike name is same in both cases here and
here as well these are same but with
where keyword you can do that let will
not allow you to do this if we use let
here in place of where we'll write let
as here as well and we will change the
value as well we will give it as
Kawasaki
and
let's suppose Suzuki here
save it
see bike name has already been declared
so that's what let won't allow you to do
you can repeat the same light variable
in different scope it won't create any
problem but it will not allow you to
redeclare any declared variable so let's
move on to const we use const when there
are values we don't want to change or
that will never change basically so the
keyword const is little misleading as it
defines a constant reference to a value
not the constant value we can't change
the Primitive value but we can change
the properties of constant objects let's
write another piece of code for const
keyword
so let's declare a variable const
X is equal to
5.
comma Y is equal to
7 let's say once
so here what we have done we declared a
variable X and a variable y with value
as 5 and 7 we declared this time with
const keyword and the variable Z which
is X Plus y we printed Z on the browser
and it shows the value as 12 which is X
Plus y 7 plus 5 is equal to 12. now what
we will do const will let you do this
but if you try to update the value of x
let's suppose we'll try to update the
value of x as x equals to X
Plus 10.
we'll print X this time
document dot right
X let's save this it will throw an error
assignment to a constant variable in
line 24 so here you want to update the
value of x you can't do this with const
keyword you can do this with let and
where as well but you can't do this with
const
also const won't allow you to re-declare
any variable just like let so if you try
to use const x again
is equal to 10 save it
so here it says identifier X has already
been declared this thing you can do with
cons the scope of const is the same as
lead it can be used within the block
where it is declared data types is an
essential Concept in every programming
language to work on any variable you
should know its type
it refers to the kind of data which is
being stored inside a variable the type
of variable is holding basically
every programming language has its own
set of data types which is unique in its
own way we discussed earlier that
JavaScript is a lightweight scripting
language because we don't need to
specify any data type in JavaScript
after all all the variables in
JavaScript are Loosely packed or we can
say JavaScript is a dynamically typed
scripting language we shall discuss
these properties later in this video for
now let me tell you about different data
types present in JavaScript
so JavaScript data types are divided
into two categories primitive data types
and non-primitive data types primitive
data types are stored in stack whereas
non-primitive data types they are stored
in Heap I don't want you to go deep in
these two terms as if you are new to
programming so we'll leave it just keep
one thing in mind that primitive data
types are base data types whereas
non-primitive data types are objects or
we can say they are derived
primitive data types they are further
divided into five categories they are
divided as numbers strings Boolean
undefined and null non-primitive data
types or complex data types we can say
on the other hand they are divided into
two parts arrays and objects will have
separate videos on these topics for now
let's discuss primitive data types to
understand primitive data types much
better let's declare a few variable here
let's say we declare where X and give it
the value as 16. we'll declare where Y
and will give it value
hello world we'll declare one more let's
say where
flag
and the value will be true
here we can talk about those properties
of JavaScript which I mentioned earlier
JavaScript variables are Loosely packed
and JavaScript is dynamically typed
scripting language these two points
refer to the same thing here you can see
we have defined three variables X we
have defined variable X we have defined
variable Y and flag as well the values
for all three variables is different
from one another
see variable X is holding a value that
is 16 variable Y is holding a value
hello world which is a string so 16 is a
number hello world is a string and
variable flag is holding a value that
refers to a Boolean value in place of
true we can also write false here
so what's happening here here you can
see there is no data type if you are
coming from a C plus plus background or
a Java background this will be a little
bit weird for you guys because in C plus
plus and Java we used to do it like we
will define an integer let let me show
you
so how we will Define integer in C plus
plus or what we'll say we'll use int x
equals to 5 or something like that we
already had a data type for string as
well we have carrying C plus plus but
here in JavaScript we have no data type
we are only using the where keyword
that's what we call as Loosely typed
this line means that you don't have to
define the data type of the variable
what happens in JavaScript is whatever
the type of value you will pass to the
variable the data type will change
accordingly
so you don't need to worry about if you
are passing a number or if you are
passing in string
just relax just when you pass the value
to the variable it will be determined
automatically so these are the three
basic primitive data types present in
JavaScript which are number
Boolean value and string
so let's move on to the next one which
is undefined we'll Define a variable p
and we'll leave it as it is so this
variable P has an undefined data type it
means that any variable which is already
declared but has no value inside it it
has an undefined data type
I'll tell you a basic operator the type
of operator
we'll go through the operators in later
videos but just try to understand the
basic need and use it with me for now
this operator will help you know the
type of value a variable is holding see
let's use it here we have declared a
variable P we'll check the type of P so
to use this operator you have to use it
with document dot right now
so we will do document.write and we'll
use two brackets
and inside it will write
type of and whatever like we want to
know the type of variable X let's
suppose we'll write here x
semicolon save it and you can see here
it says number this means that this
variable has a value which is a number
similarly we will check for all the
variables present here we'll check for
every variable we'll check for y will
check for flag and we'll check for p as
well let's copy this and
paste it three time and let's change the
value here from X to Y in this line
and from X to flag here
and here we'll change it to p
so we have done it we'll save it and see
here it says number first variable y it
says it's a string because you know
hello world is a string it's a sequence
of character for variable flag it says
Boolean so it's defined as true or false
and for variable P it's written here
undefined with this we are left with
only one primitive data type the null
data type there's a difference between a
null value and an undefined value
undefined means lack of value whereas
null means the absence of any value
suppose you are using null as the value
for any variable the type of operator
will return this variable as an object
but if you are not giving any value to
this variable you are leaving it after
declaration the type of operator will
return undefined here's an example for
this C we'll declare one more variable
here we'll declare where num let's name
this variable num and we will give it
the value as null we'll use
document.write type of and we will check
with the help of type of operator that
what type of value the variable num is
holding so let's give here
num
we are good to go press Ctrl s and C
here it says it's an object
so a null value will always be shown as
an object we'll talk about the complex
types or composite types in further
videos we'll have separate videos for
each of these types don't worry about it
the term control statement is pretty
self-explanatory and straightforward
right we came across JavaScript
statements in previous videos JavaScript
statements are the instructions that
tells the browser to perform specific
actions control statements are also
instructions and they govern the flow of
control in a program
so let's take a look at control
statements with the help of an example
let's suppose we have a piece of code
that is n number of statements here
let's say we have this code and so the
conventional workflow will be it will
first execute the first statement then
second then third and so on till
statement n right
so this is the basic flow right from
statement 1 till statement n and it will
execute each statement in between
however in real world the scenario is
different like we don't write the code
in same menu every time
for example let's suppose you are in
line 5 and you want to print this line
10 times so what should you do you can
write this line 10 times or you can copy
paste it right okay let's forget about
10 times let's suppose you have to use
this code or we can say let's suppose
you have to print this statement 100
times doing this like copy pasting it
for 100 times or writing this statement
for 100 times that's useless and
unnecessary right so that's where
control statements comes into picture
we'll discuss them in a while let's
assume another situation
this time you want to make a choice
based on certain conditions you can use
conditional operators but then it has
limitations right to tackle this problem
we have control statements in JavaScript
so these are the very basic reasons why
we need control statements for
performing a certain activity like if we
want to perform a certain activity n
number of times or if you want to make a
certain decision making kind of
scenarios in your program that's where
we need control statements in JavaScript
in JavaScript we have two different
types of control statements depending
upon what action we are performing so we
have the conditional control statements
and we have the iterative or we can say
looping control statements
talking about conditional statements as
the name suggests we use conditional
statements when we have to make
decisions based on conditions when we
have two choices or when we can say when
we have two different conditions and we
want to make choices accordingly so
that's where we use conditional
statements we have two different types
of conditional statements the if else
statements and the switch case
talking about the iterative statements
as the name suggests if you want to
perform any action more than once or
maybe n number of times instead of
writing them again and again
we use Loops so Loops are basically
statements we use Loops to perform any
activity n number of times with specific
conditions
so in JavaScript we have four different
type of Loops we have for Loop while
loop do while loop and foreign Loop
so the for Loop while loop and do while
loop you might have heard about them
earlier because they are also present in
other programming languages but this
foreign Loop this is a new type of loop
present in JavaScript we use foreign
loop with objects we'll go through
objects in upcoming videos and of course
we'll be looking at each of these
control statements in detail
will have a particular video for each of
these topics
now let me introduce to you the break
and the continue statement
they are not the types of control
statements but they do assist in other
control statements the break is used to
exit a switch statement or Loop like
when used in a loop it breaks the loop
and continues executing the code after
it
and on the other hand the continue
statement breaks a single iteration when
used in a loop when we use continuous
statement in a loop it breaks a single
iteration and it breaks the iteration
only if the specified condition occurs
and then it will continue with the next
iteration in the loop
so the if else conditional statement is
used whenever we work with condition it
can be either a single condition or
maybe more than one condition or
multiple conditions we can work with
so let's try to write a basic program
with a single condition
so then we'll move on to multiple
conditions using the elsif statement so
we'll create a new file today so I hope
you guys know the importance of creating
a separate file for every topic you know
it will be easy for you to work to find
out that separate file later if you want
to revise that topic
so here is the program where we have
taken a variable X and the value of x is
10. so what we are doing in this program
is we are checking if the value the
variable X is holding that is value 10.
and if the value is less than
10 or if the value is greater than 10 so
we have only two conditions either the
value can be less than 10 or the value
can be greater than 10 or equals to 10
is
so here in this program what we'll do
we'll first we'll update this value as 8
so the variable X is holding the value
8. so to check the output let's save it
and here you can see it says the value
of x is less than 10. of course the
value 8 is always less than 10 right so
for it that's fine it will say the value
is less than 10 and similarly if we do
the same for let's say 11 save it now
and see it says the value of x is
greater than 10. so that's quite simple
right but what if we are giving the
value as 10. we know 10 is equals to 10
so save it now and see here you can see
it says the value of x is greater than
10.
this is happening because what we did we
as we told The Interpreter to check the
value if the value of x is less than 10.
we didn't mention that if what to do if
the value is equals to 10. so it will
check for only X is less than 10 not for
equals to 10 or greater than 10 so here
what it is doing it is checking if the
value is less than 10 so that it says
okay let's print this statement if the
value is less than 10 or
if the value is not less than 10 or if
the value is equals to or greater than
10 it will print the value of x is
greater than 10. to avoid this type of
misunderstanding we use an elsif
statement so the concept of else if
statement is the same as if statement
but we are doing we are using multiple
conditions right we are giving it more
than one condition so how to use else if
it's quite easy and the syntax is also
similar to
the if statement the only difference is
that it contains an else before if so
it's an elsif so what we are doing is
we are giving it a condition that else
if x equals to 10.
so now what it will do it will check for
two conditions that if the value X is
holding is less than 10 or equals to 10.
and what we'll do we'll update it as
so let's check the output now
save and see here it says the value of x
is equals to time right so I hope you
guys are getting this the execution flow
for this program will be like it will
check for the first condition if x is
less than 10 if yes it will print the
value of x is less than 10 if no it will
move on the to the following condition
like under the else if statement it
finds a condition that if x is equals to
10 it will check for it if yes if x is
equals to 10 then it will print the
value of x is equals to 10.
or if not then otherwise it will move to
else statement and print the value of x
is greater than 10 we don't need to
specify any particular condition for
this you know because we have already
specified the two conditions that if x
is less than 10 or if x is equals to 10
now we'll take a look at some basic
programs other than this one we'll take
a look at a few more basic programs
so here's the another program what we
are doing here is we are taking a
variable X and the value of x is 5. so
what we are doing is we are checking if
the number is an even number or an odd
number then you have to keep in mind is
the logic to find whether a number is
even or an odd number so to check uh
whether a number is even you what we do
we'll divide that number with two right
but basically we want is we want the
remainder as 0 when we use the modulus
operator so what we'll do here we have
written X mod 2 equals to equals to 0.
so if the remainder is 0
then the number will be an even number
because it is divisible by 2 else it
will be an odd number so that's quite
simple right let's save it and check the
output for 5 it says odd number yeah 5
is of course an odd number right so
that's for even and odd number
so here we are with another program here
it says we have a variable Y and the
value of y is
let's say
eat and what we are doing here is we are
checking if a number is positive or
negative or zero so we have three
different conditions either number can
be positive or it can be a negative
number Any number greater than 0 is a
positive number right and any number
less than zero is a negative number and
the third one is a number zero it's
neither positive non-negative so let's
check for the number eight save it and
see here you can see it is a positive
number let's see for
minus 2 save it now it says a negative
number for 0 it will say 0.
so these two programs are quite simple
guys right the conditions are pretty
simple we use modulus operator we used
greater than or less than sign and
that's quite easy to use right so let's
move on to the next program which is a
bit tricky than these two
so what we'll do in our next program is
we'll check if a number is positive or
negative and at the same time we'll
check for even an odd also
if you are giving any number as input
like let's suppose we are using 5 we'll
check if the number is positive or
negative and odd or even so we'll do
this simultaneously let's move on to
this program so there are two ways to
check whether a number is positive or
negative and odd or even
so the two methods we'll discuss them
one by one the first one here is
to use nested if and another one is when
we use logical operators along with the
if else if statement so this one here
you can see right in front of your
screen is the nested if method so here
you can see we have used the if
statement we have given one more
condition inside another if statement so
first it will check whether a number is
positive or not for X greater than 0 it
will check if the number X is greater
than 0 then if yes if it will find it
that yes this number is greater than 0
then it will move on to the nested if
and it will check for odd or even
for odd number and even number it will
check if it finds that the number is
even it will print that the number is
positive and even if the number is not
even it will print the number is
positive and odd so here you can see the
difference what The Interpreter is doing
is it will check for the number as
positive and if the number is positive
then it will move on to the nestative
and check for the even or odd so if it
finds that the number is even it will
print positive and even otherwise it
will print positive and odd then it will
move on to the next condition which is
for negative number if x is less than 0
then it will again move to the nested if
and it will check for even and odd so if
it finds that the number is even it will
print negative and even otherwise it
will print negative and odd and the last
condition is for the number is 0. let's
try to find out the output of this and
what we'll do we'll update the value of
x as eight so save it now here it says
the positive and even so 8 is a positive
number and even as well let's update the
value of x is minus 5.
save it now it says negative and odd
number minus 5 is a negative odd number
right so that's how it will check for
positive
or negative and odd or even so we are
doing both the things simultaneously in
a program we have an alternate method as
well here you can see on your screen we
have written a program and here we have
taken a variable X the functioning of
both the programs is same
both of these program will check for
positive or negative and odd or even
so here you can see I have taken a
variable X let's say the value of x is
7. it will check for X greater than 0
and x mod 2 is equals to equals to zero
so we have four different conditions
right a number is
greater than 0 that means a number is
positive and even a number is positive
and odd a number is negative and even a
number is negative and odd and the final
one is a number is zero okay we have
five conditions and we have to specify
these four conditions here so here we
you can see we are using the logical and
operator this means it will print this
statement let's suppose for this
statement it will print this only if
both the conditions are true right if
the number if the value X is holding is
both greater than 0 and an even number
so if you try to
find out the output now save it and see
here it says number is positive and out
so the number 7 is greater than zero
but the number 7 is not an even number
that's why this line is not there on the
browser it will print this line because
the number is positive and odd right the
switch case is another conditional
control statement and just like the if
else control statement there is a
difference between the usage of if else
and switch case statement
now both if else and switch case works
with conditions and we have to choose
when to use which case over if else
switch case is generally preferred over
the if else when there is n number of
test cases present or we can say when we
are working with a lot of conditions
let's say we are working on a program
and you ask the user for an input
between 50 and 100 a numeric input
basically and in the output we have to
print the textual form of that number
suppose if the user enters 75 right the
output will be like this
so what we are doing we we are taking a
number from the user as an input and we
are printing the textual form of that
number right
so we can use the if else or we can say
else if control statement but the
program will be so lengthy and not so
clean
also switch case is much more efficient
than if else when it comes to execution
time like if we have a number of
conditions then using switch case is a
better option we'll get to know why in a
bit so let's move on to the programming
part and today
we'll write a program where we have to
find the month in a year by accepting
its number so we have 12 months in a
year for example if we enter 4 then the
output will be April and if we enter 8
then the output will be August because
August is the eighth month of the year
right so I hope you guys are clear with
the question of course we can do this
program with the help of if else
statement but we discussed earlier that
using IF else in such cases is not
efficient right we can use switch case
in this scenario so let's create a
variable first let's say we are creating
a variable where month and
you can give any value to this variable
from 1 to 12 you can provide it with any
initial value
so let's create a variable first let's
say we are creating a variable where
month and the value we are providing it
one as the hardcore initial value for
Simplicity again we are not taking the
input from the user or from the browser
to do so we have to first go through the
Dom manipulations and we'll go through
it in later videos so let's start with
the switch case now
the Syntax for switch case is quite
simple just write down
switch and
pass the variable month
so we have to check in this round
bracket for the variable month because
you know any value you are providing to
month the switch will check the program
accordingly so for now we have taken the
value as one for month we can take any
value like we can take 3 we can take 11
12 or any value other than 1 to 12 as
well so whatever value you are providing
to the variable you can provide the
variable to the switch statement right
so next up we have an open and curly
braces for the body of the switch case
we have to test for 12 different
conditions inside this
starting from 1 to 12 right so the
syntax goes like this you have to write
case
and then the value month variable might
hold like 1 2 3 and so on followed by a
colon right so we have to write the
value 1 and
a colon not a semicolon but a column
keep this thing in mind guys and below
that we are going to write what we want
when the value is 1 like what the output
we want when the value is 1 so we have
to write document
dot right
and
whatever you want as the output like for
one the first month is January so we are
writing here
January and a semicolon
so if the value of the month is 1 you
will get the output as January save it
and here you can see the output is
January
let me increase the font size for this
as well
so here you can see the output is
January right next we'll use a break
statement
if you guys remember we discussed the
break statement in the control
statements video right the break
statement is not actually a type of
control statement but it assists other
control statements or we can say it
helps us manage the control statements
right what this statement does is once
we are done with the output we get our
output right once we are done with case
1 we get our output as January this
break statement helps us to come out of
the switch case so to understand this
much better let's write here one more
case so let's say we are writing here
one more case as
case 2
and the output will be document dot
right
the second month is February right
and February we can write so
we'll include one break here like we'll
come in the first case and include a
break statement so here's how you can
write a break statement how you can
include a break statement in your code
so let's check the output now so for now
it says January
so if we don't include this break
statement here when The Interpreter will
execute this code
and it will see that the case is 1 right
so it will print January
but it will print other statements as
well so for example if we remove this
break statement and save it now see you
can see here the output as January and
February January and February both are
getting printed on the output so we need
a break statement to break it here see
the value is 1 and if we include break
statement here the moment The
Interpreter finds the answer the correct
answer as January it will come out of
the switch keys
so I hope you guys are getting this
similarly we'll write all the cases for
all the months let me show you all the
cases
so here you can see on your screen that
we have 12 different cases from 1 to 12
one for each month depending on the
value the variable month is holding
right
the output will be June if the value is
6 and if we say 10 the output will be
October and so on and so forth
now the question here is what if we try
to write a random value for the variable
month
by random value we mean that if we try
to write any value other than these 12
values from 1 to 12 if if you leave
these values then if we try to write
another value like if we write here 13.
so what will be the output now let's
save it and see there is no output and
there might be no error for this as well
so if you try to check for an error go
to inspect and check out
see there's no error right so in that
case we have one more case like we have
default case
so let me show you how to include
default in your program what you have to
do is write here default
with a colon and right
document
dot right and let's suppose we are
writing here
wrong input
what is happening is let's try to run
this program First Press Ctrl s and now
you can see it says raw input for value
13.
so what is happening is the switch case
will first check these 12 cases and any
value other than 1 to 12 will get the
output as wrong input it works the same
as the else statement right analysis
statement we don't need to specify any
particular condition any condition other
than the if condition or else if
condition will fall inside the else
statement it's not necessary to add
default in your program it's just if you
want to give the user a prompt that he
has entered a wrong value
so you must include this default case in
your program every time by using switch
case because it's quite useful you know
okay so this is the complete program to
find out the month by accepting its
number
so if you try
six
and save it now it will say Zoom if you
try 10 save it it will say October if
we'll try 12 save it it will say
December so I hope this is clear to you
guys
next up let's discuss about switch case
in detail because the switch case in
JavaScript Works differently from other
languages like switch cases also present
in C plus plus and Java but in
JavaScript it is a bit different so in
JavaScript
switch case can accept numbers it can
accept strings and Boolean values as
well now let's have a look at how the
switch case works with string values
so here is an example of string values
you can see the value variable month is
holding is June right and you can see
use this string in case as well so here
you have to give the case as a string
value right because we are using switch
case statement with
strings so the first case here is when
the value will be June the output should
be sixth month and when the value is
July the output will be seventh month so
let's check it out if this is working or
not let's save this program and see for
June it says sixth month and similarly
we can check it for July as well let's
check for July
save it and see it says seventh month
you can include the default case as well
if you want to it will be similar like
there's no difference for default case
let me show you how
will write here wrong input
save it and now let's try to change the
value here let's say we are using May
save it and see it says wrong input what
if we use a numerical value here let's
try to use two save it now it says wrong
input for 2 as well it will give you the
output when the value is either June or
July
so any other value you try to use here
it will give the output as wrong input
in the same way it works for Boolean
values as well let me show you how it
works for Boolean values so what you
have to do instead of 2 you have to give
here a Boolean value let's suppose you
are writing here true and for true you
have to change the case as well for true
you have to change the output as let's
say for true it the output will be 1.
okay and similarly for false
the output should be 0.
and the output should be wrong input for
any other case right so save it now and
see here for true it says one the output
you can see here is one and if you try
to do the same for false like let's
write here false
and now try to check the output see here
it says 0.
you can see the output is correct right
we will discuss uh our first iterative
control statement that is the for Loop
in JavaScript
so iterative statements or looping
statements we can say are used when we
want to perform an activity multiple
times or n number of times so we don't
have to copy paste that code every time
but we can use iterative statements
using iterative statements we'll make a
code clean and definitely more efficient
so we have four different types of
iterative control statements right we
discussed it in the previous video let's
move on to for Loop which is the first
iterative control statement and we'll
move on to the programming part directly
so before we start one thing to keep in
mind guys is that we use for Loop when
we are clear with the number of
iterations in advance so let's start
with the first program in this program
we will print the multiplication table
of 10 from 10 into 1 to 10 into 10.
let's start with coding
first we write the four keyword and then
we have
three different parts we have the
initialization
which is separated by a semicolon next
up we have the condition
and finally
we have the increment or decrement
so this is the Syntax for for Loop next
up we have the open and the closed curly
braces for the body of for Loop
we'll change these three values
as these are not the actual values right
or parameters for these three different
parts of the loop are going to be
different
so let me comment this one so we'll what
we'll do we'll leave it here only we'll
change it from here so in the
initialization part what we are going to
do is we'll create a variable let's say
we are creating a variable where a and
the value of and the initial value of a
will be 1.
this initialization happens only one
time when the for Loop begins we have to
be careful about the condition we are
going to use because sometimes what
happens is the loop runs forever because
of a wrong condition which will
ultimately crash our program
so in the condition what we have to do
is we have to give a value as in for how
long a for Loop should execute here in
this case we want to print the table of
10 right we want to have 10 iterations
so what it will do it will start from a
equals to n and it will go till this
final condition so let's suppose we are
writing here a less than equals to 10.
it will start from a equals to 1 and it
will go till a less than or equals to 10
and next up we'll use the increment
operator we want to increment the value
of a by 1 every time right so we'll use
increment operator a plus plus or we can
say a equals to A plus 1 both are the
same things right so here the condition
will be like this for variable a equals
to 1 a less than equals to 10 and a plus
plus
so here you can see the loop will
execute from a equals to 1 till a equals
to 10 and the value will be increased by
1 every time because we have used the
increment operator right next up the
body of for Loop will go like so what we
want to print if we want to print the
table of 10 right so we'll use document
dot right and inside document.red we'll
use the H1 tag
so what we want to do is we want to
print the table of 10 right so we'll
multiply 10 by a
for every iteration the value of a will
be multiplied by 10 and then it will be
printed on the browser so we'll close
the H1 tag here
in the semicolon
so here you can see we have printed 10
into a let's save it and check the
output first and then we'll look at the
execution flow of this program
see here the multiplication table of 10
is printed on the browser you can see 10
20 30 40. so on and so forth till 100.
so what is happening is firstly the for
Loop is also known as the entry control
Loop it means that the condition is
checked initially the first time the for
Loop runs
we perform initialization only once so
here the values stored at variable a is
1. initially the value is 1 next up it
will check for a less than equals to 10
is a which is 1 is 1 less than equals to
10 then true the control will be shifted
to document.write and it will print
10 into the value of a is 1 right so it
will print 10 here
next thing it will go for the increment
and the value of a will be changed to 2
from 1 1 plus 1 or we can say 1 equals
to 1 plus 1 right so it will be 2. now
next thing it will leave this now
because the initialization happens only
once now it will go for the condition
directly now it will check for is 2 less
than or equals to 10 if yes then again
the control will be shifted here and it
will print 10 into 2 because the value
of a is 2 now and after that it it will
print 20 here and after that
the value of a will be increased to 3
because we have used a plus plus then it
will check for 3 is 3 less than 10 and
same thing will happen it will print 30
and so on and so forth till the value of
a is 10. now if the value of a is 10 it
will print 100 right and when the value
is incremented it will become 11.
so what will happen now it will check
for 11 less than equals to 10. no we
know that 11 is not less than equal to
10 right then it comes out of the loop
and it will print nothing after that so
this is the basic working of the for
Loop will go through one more program
wherein we'll print the odd numbers
between 1 and 10. so what are odd
numbers odd numbers are those numbers
which are not divisible by 2 right so we
have the odd number says 1 3 5 7 9 and
we want to print them so the difference
between each number is of 2 the 1 plus 2
plus 2 plus 2 till 9 right so what we
have to do is we have to write here a
plus equals to 2 we have to increase the
value of a by 2. and instead of writing
here 10 into a because this time we
don't want to
print any multiplication table we want
to print a number only right so we'll
use a only
save it and check the output it says one
three five seven nine so these are the
odd numbers present between 1 and 10.
keep one thing in mind that you have to
give the condition wisely every time
so next up we have the while loop like
the for Loop while loop is also an entry
control Loop which means that the
condition will be checked first so the
question here is how while loop is
different from the for Loop if you guys
remember when we discussed that we must
know the exact number of iterations then
only we can use the for Loop right so
the while loop is preferred when we are
not aware of the number of iterations or
we can say we don't know if the
condition will be true for a certain
number of times we'll start with the
programming partner and then we will
discuss more about when to use while
loop over for Loop
so let's start with the program in this
particular program we will print odd
numbers up to a specific number let's
say we want to print all the odd numbers
up to 50.
so we want to print all the odd numbers
from 1 till 50 right
we came across the same program in the
previous video as well but this time we
will use the while loop instead of for
Loop so the Syntax for the while loop is
relatively easy to use the code goes
like we start with the while keyword
then opening and closing round round
brackets and finally the body of while
loop in curly braces
if you guys remember from the previous
video wherein we use the for Loop we had
three different parts right we had the
initialization we had conditions and the
increment decrement part here we have
only one condition and until this
condition holds true the while loop will
be executed for example here we want to
print all the odd numbers from 1 to 50
right so we'll first initialize a
variable
let's initialize a variable first let's
say we have a variable X and the value
of x will be 1.
we used a 1 because 1 is the very first
odd number right after that inside the
condition what we want to do is we want
to print the odd numbers up to 50.
so while the condition will be like
while
X less than equals to 50. so the loop
will go till X is less than or equals to
50. or we can say x less than 15 that
depends on us if we want to check for 50
or not so the odd numbers will go like
one and then we have three then we have
five then we have seven and up to 50. so
the last odd number will be 49 so inside
the while loop we will print the value
of x so here we will print the value of
x let's print it
document dot right
and inside this we will print the value
of x inside the H1 tag
suppose we try to run this program now
it will go on an infinite Loop and the
reason for this is we are not doing
anything to increment the value of x
just like in for Loop if you remember we
had the initialization first we had the
initialization here as well then we had
the condition we have a condition here
as well and then finally it has an
increment or decrement part right so
here we don't have that same increment
or decrement part we have to do it
separately so we'll increment the value
of x here only so here we will write X
plus equals to 2 or we can say it is
same as x equals to X plus 2 you guys
are aware of it right so the reason is
simple because we want to go from 1 to 3
to 5 and so on that's why we use X plus
equals to 2. we incremented the value of
x by 2.
save it here and let's check the output
so here you can see it says one three
five seven nine and so on and so forth
till 49 so 49 is the last odd number
before 50 because we are checking
between 1 and 50 right so 49 is the last
odd number
let me show you how the program goes
into an infinite Loop so for that what
we have to do we will comment this whole
line here let's check the output now
save it and here you can see it is
refreshing forever and this is basically
how a program in an infinite Loop looks
like
the output of this program is the
program will ultimately crash so what we
have to do we have to open a new tab and
then again we have to run the program
with correct increment part so here you
can see you can wait for it to become
responsive or exit the page so here you
can see we have all the odd numbers from
1 up to 50 and the last one is 49.
coming back to the difference between
the while loop and the for Loop we did
the same program previously right using
the for Loop so where to use while loop
over for Loop so consider a scenario
where we are taking input from the user
and the input from the user is y we want
to do something let's say we want to
print something on the screen or if the
input from the user is n we want the
process to be stopped we can give the
condition in the while loop which will
go like when the character y becomes n
the process will be stopped we'll go
through one such program once we are
done with the Dom manipulation part
wherein we take the input from the user
let's move on to the do while loop in
JavaScript
in the previous videos we have already
discussed that both for Loop and the
while loop are entry control Loop that
means the conditions are checked first
right but the do while loop is a bit
different or we can say it is an exit
control Loop wherein the condition is
checked after the execution of the loops
body thus an exit control loop executes
at least once even if the test condition
fails or we can say the condition is
wrong the loop will execute once using
the do while loop is relatively easy it
seems like we are giving the system a
command to do something while the
condition is something
so let's start with the syntax now
the syntax goes like this we write the
keyword do and we have a pair of curly
braces for the body of the loop and
after that we have the while keyword and
here we will write the condition
make sure you are using the semicolon
after the while loop it's necessary
while using do while loop keep this
thing in mind
so we have two parts in the do while
loop the do part and the while part or
we can say the condition part while part
is the part where we write the condition
so let's Define a variable first let's
say we are using a variable we are using
a variable X and the value of x will be
5.
so here we have taken 5 as a random
value you can take 1 as well now inside
the condition part of the do while loop
this is the condition part where we are
using the while keyword so we'll give a
condition let's say we are using while X
greater than 5 it will check for the
condition that if the value of x is
greater than 5. or if the value of x is
smaller than or equal to 5 it will come
out of the loop in the loop part we will
write what we want to do let's say we
want to print a single sentence here we
write document.write
and whatever sentence we want to write
let's say we are using
welcome to
simply code so here you might be
thinking that the condition is false but
the condition will be checked after the
first iteration in the do while loop so
no matter what the condition is the
first iteration will happen always so if
we try to save this program and let's
try to run this here you can see the
output is welcome to Simply code a
single line is printed
what is happening here is although the
condition we used was wrong but the
condition will be checked only after the
first iteration when the Dual Loop will
perform this particular statement when
the document.write will be performed
after that it will check for the
condition if x is greater than 5 or not
if we use a 6 instead of 5. let's try to
write here 6 instead of 5 and if we run
this program now it will go into an
infinite Loop because we are not
performing the increment decrement
operator here right as we have discussed
in the previous videos the importance of
increment decrement part so we need to
do it here after the document.write part
so what we'll do here we'll write x
minus minus today we are using x minus
minus and for the other two Loops we use
the plus increment operator right so the
x minus minus is the same as x equals to
x minus 1 let's check the output now
save it here you can see the output is
still welcome to Simply code the
execution flow of this program will be
like it will first perform the iteration
before checking the condition and it
will print here welcome to Simply code
for the first time when the loop will
start executing it will first perform
this statement and it will write here
welcome to Simply code
so then it will perform x minus minus
means the value of x is now 5 because we
are decrementing the value by 1. so when
the value of x is 5 then it will check
for the condition if x is greater than 5
or not so here we can see clearly X is
not greater than 5 because x equals to 5
and it is equals to 5 right so it will
come out of the loop
let's make few changes in the code here
suppose we use here 10 instead of 6 now
and let's print the value of x as well
it will be easy for you to understand so
we'll print here x and we'll use a
space so that it will be clear for you
we'll use here the BR tag and now let's
try to run this program here you can see
the output goes from 10 to 6 and it
prints welcome to Simply code every time
right if you guys are wondering where we
use the do while loop sometimes it may
happen that even though the condition is
false but we have to execute that
command we use the do I Loop when we
want the code to Output some sort of
menu to the user or to generate the menu
at least once will get to know about the
do while loop in future videos when we
create a program specifically for the
Dual Loop this video is just a syntax
demonstration we'll go through the
examples of all the three Loops present
in JavaScript so today we have three
different problems
for three separate Loops right we'll go
through each of the problems and we'll
discuss the execution flow for each Loop
we'll go through so let's start this
session with the first problem statement
so the first problem statement goes like
this so here we have to write a program
to check whether a number is prime or
not I hope you guys are aware of what
prime numbers are right so a prime
number is a positive number that is only
divisible by 1 and itself for example 2
3 5 and we have 7 and 11 these are the
first few prime numbers right if we take
an example let's say we are taking an
example of 7 so 7 is a number which is
divisible by 1 and 7 only no other
number can divide 7 right so here in
this code we have to check whether up
number is prime or not so let me take
you through the code
so here is the code to check whether a
number is a prime number or not let me
take you through this first so we have a
variable number and the value of
variable number can be any random value
like any number you want to check if the
number is prime number or not you can
give that value to the variable number
so here we have taken 83 next up we have
a variable is prime whose value is a
Boolean value right it can be true for a
prime number or it can be false for a
non-prime number so we have used
comments in this program to make it
easier for you guys to understand so
here we have used the if statement to
check if the number is 1 because we know
that 1 is neither a prime number nor a
composite number right so we have to
check if the user enters the value one
or if we are giving the value 1 we have
to check for it so if user enters the
value 1 it will print this statement
that 1 is neither prime nor composite
here in elseif we are checking if the
value of number is greater than 1 or not
so if the value of number is greater
than 1 the control will be shifted to
for Loop present inside the elsif
statement right here you can see we have
the for Loop here the control will be
shifted to this for Loop so here you can
see we have initialized the variable I
and the initial value is set to 2 that's
because any prime number is divisible by
1 as well right so it won't make any
sense to include one here will start
from 2 and we'll check until the value
of I becomes half of the value of number
so if we take an example of 10 we'll
check until 5 because you know any
number greater than 5 won't divide 10
right it's practically not possible so
we'll check for number by 2 or we can
say we'll check till 5 only and the
value will be increased by 1 every time
till now I hope you guys are aware of
how to use for Loop and why we are using
for Loop here we can do the same program
using while loop as well but to make it
more clear how to use for Loop we are
doing this program with the help of for
Loop so then we have the I plus plus or
we can say we have increased the value
of I by 1 after every iteration until
the value of I becomes
half of the number
so the condition number percent I equals
to equals to 0. so here is the main
condition to check if the number is
divisible by I or not so the execution
will be like if we are taking here a
number 10 it will start from 2 and it
will check if the remainder is 0 or not
so if the remainder is 0 then the value
of is prime will be changed to false and
it will come out of the loop
next it will check for the value of is
prime if the value of S Prime is true or
not here you can see if the value of is
prime is true then it will print n or we
can say then it will print that the
number is a prime number else it will
print that the number is not a prime
number if the value of is prime is false
for example when we took the example of
number as 10 so the value of S Prime
will be changed to false because you
know 10 divides by 2 is equals to 0 or
we can say the remainder will be 0 so
the value of S Prime will be changed to
false and for false it will print number
is not a prime number
so at last we will check if the number
is less than 1 if the number entered by
the user or any other number we have
taken like if we take a minus 5. so it
will print the number is not a prime
number
Because by the usual definition of prime
numbers any negative number cannot be a
prime number that's a usual definition
right so we have to keep this thing in
mind and here in this else Loop we'll
print that if any negative number is
entered we'll make sure that the program
gives the output that the number is not
a prime number
so let's try to run this program and
check the output let's save this program
and the output says 83 is a prime number
as 83 is not divisible by any number
except 1 and 83. for example if we take
here any number which is divisible by so
let's say we are taking 75 save it now
and see it says 75 is not a prime number
okay here's a spelling mistake it says
75 is a not prime number so here we'll
correct this
is
so we are done with it and save it now
now it says 75 is not a prime number s75
is divisible by numbers other than one
end itself right it is divisible by 3 it
is divisible by 5 15 and 25 as well all
these numbers divide 75 basically so
let's take a different value here
let's say we are taking minus 7.
let's change the value here as or we can
take it as minus 75 let's save it now so
it says the number is not a prime number
or if we want to try for one as well
let's take it as 1
and let's check the output now so it
says one is neither prime nor composite
number because we have given here the
condition if number is equals to is
equals to 1 then it will print that one
is neither a prime nor a composite
number
you can try this program with the help
of other Loops as well so let's move on
to the second problem statement but
before that let me take you through the
same program using the while loop so
here you can see we have used the file
Loop for the same instead of for Loop
here you can see we have used while I
less than a number by 2 and we have
given the increment condition here and
we have initialized the value of I
at the start of the program so if we try
to run this program it will give us the
same output there will be no change in
the output so we can use while loop as
well so we'll use the while loop in
other program
let's move on to the second problem
statement so in this example we'll learn
to write a program in JavaScript to
check whether a number is an Armstrong
number or not
so we'll do this with the help of while
loop let's have a look at how to
implement this program before proceeding
to the coding part let's have a look at
what is an Armstrong number so an
Armstrong number of three digits is in
integer such that the sum of the cubes
of its digits is equal to the number
itself
so for example 153 is in Armstrong
number since 1 into 1 into 1 it means
the cube of the digit 1 plus the cube of
5 that is 5 into 5 into 5 which is equal
to 125 and the cube of 3 which is three
threes are Nine and Nine threes are 27
so it will go like 125
plus 27 plus 1 so which is equal to 153
so an Armstrong number of three digits
is an integer such that the sum of the
cubes of its digits is equal to the
number itself so here we have the code
for the same this is the code to check
whether the number is an Armstrong
number or not
so here we have taken a variable and the
value is 153 the value of the variable
number is 153 right because we already
know that 153 is an Armstrong number
there are few more numbers like 3 7 1 is
also an Armstrong number next up we have
taken a variable sum and the initial
value of sum is 0. we have used the
variable sum to store the value of the
cubes and next up we have a temporary
variable so that we can break a three
digit number and we need the number
after all this all this program all
these loops and all will need the number
we'll need the original number to
compare it with the sum of the cubes
which will be hold in sum so but we need
to break the number as well right so we
need a temporary variable to break it
here we use the while loop and the loop
will run until the value of variable
temp is greater than zero so the initial
value of temp will be 153 here in this
particular case the initial value will
be one five three and the loop will run
until the value of 153 is greater than
0. next up we have a variable remainder
that stores the last digits value as we
are dividing 153 by 10. so
the remainder here will be 3 so the
value save that variable remainder will
be 3 for the first time then what will
happen when we are updating the value of
sum and the new value of sum will be 0
plus 3 into 3 into 3 so 3 3's are Nine
and Nine threes are 27 so the updated
value of sum will be 27 next up we are
removing the last digit from the number
so for example we have here one five
three and if we divide 1 5 3 by 10 the
answer will be 1 5.3 that's why we are
using here parsing because what percent
will do it will convert the float value
into an integer so if we try to perform
a simple divide in JavaScript like if we
try to divide 153 by 10 it will give us
1 5.3 it will give us a float value but
we want an integer value right so
percent will
change this value to the nearest integer
so 1 5.3 the nearest integer will be 1 5
so the new value of temp will be one
five then again this Loop will be
executed and for this time the variable
reminder will hold the value of 15
modulus 10 and the remainder will be 5
right
so the new value of remainder is 5 and
the value of sum is 27 plus 5 into 5
into 5 which is 27 plus 125 right so the
new value of sum will be 152.
and then again it will go to the temp
and it will divide 15 by 10 and it will
change the value to an integer so 1.5
will be changed to 1 and next up the
final value of temp is 1 which is
greater than 0 right so it will divide
10 by 1 and the remainder will be 1.
so next up it will add 152 plus 1 into 1
into 1 that is 153 right and then it
will divide 1 by 10 using the percent
but this time the value will be 0
because there is no remainder right
next up we'll compare the value of the
sum and the number variable so the sum
variable here it is holding the value as
153. we break this number into three
different parts then we took the cube of
these three number and added them so the
final value of the variable sum is 153
and the initial value of number or we
can say the value we gave to the
variable number is 153 so right it will
print here that 153 is an Armstrong
number or if we use any other number
instead of 153 let's suppose we are
using 121 so it will print 121 is not an
Armstrong number let's check out the
output ones let's save it and see the
output a is one five three is an
Armstrong number so if we change the
value of one five three two
one two one
so let's check the output now it says 1
to 1 is not an Armstrong number why
because if we take the cube of each of
the digit and we'll add them suppose the
answer here will be 10 because the cube
of 1 is 1 and the cube of 2 is 8 and the
cube of the final one is 1 so 8 plus 1
plus 1 is equals to 10. so that's why
one two one is not an Armstrong number
let's move on to our last problem
statement where we'll use the do I Loop
to find the factorial of a number
so here's the problem statement where
we'll have to write a program
to find the factorial of a number
so factorial of an integer is the
product of an integer and all the
integers below it or we can say before
it till 1 so if we take an example of 5.
so the factorial of 5 will be
it will multiply each number before it
if we take 5 the factorial will be 5
into 4 into 3 into 2 into 1. or if we
don't include one that's totally fine so
this program is pretty simple as
compared to the previous two video
so this is a small one too let me take
you through this so here we have the
program
and here we have three variables right
we have a variable I which is
initialized as 1 then we have a variable
n which is 5 and then we have a variable
F whose value is 1 F is for factorial
and n is for number we want to check the
factorial of and I is for checking the
condition
so here what we will do we'll use a loop
where if we for example if we are taking
5 then the loop will go from 1 into 2
into 3 into 4 into 5 from 1 to that
number it's not like if we are using
from 5 towards one but we are going from
1 towards five the answer will be same
right because we are multiplying all the
numbers in both the cases
so here we took 5 as the number next up
we have a variable F and the value of f
is also one as you know
so here we are using the do while loop
for the first iteration it will perform
this so the value of f for the first
iteration will be f equals to F into I
which means f equals to 1 into 1 which
is one so the value of I will be
increased and it will become 2 and now
it will check for while 2 is less than
equals to n yes 2 is less than n so it
will again go up and it will update the
value of F and the new value of of f
will be 1 into 2 that is 2 then again
the value will be increased and it will
become 3 and then it will
change the value of
f as well if it will become 6 and the
value of I will become 4 then it will
check if 4 is less than 5 yes 4 is less
than 5 and then it will multiply 4 with
6 because the value of f for 6 right so
4 into 6 it will become 24 and then
finally the value of I will be 5 and it
will check if the value of I is less
than or equals to 5 right while I is
less than equals to 5 yes that's true
because now 5 is equals to 5 and it will
again execute the loop and the value of
f will be 24 into 5 which is 120 and
then again the value of I will be
increased now it will become 6 which is
greater than 5 so it will come out of
the loop and it will print the factorial
of a number so let's save this program
to the factorial of 5 is 120. because
see here we have used the factorial of
n n is 5 and the factorial is 120 so if
we try to give any other number here
other than 5 let's say we are using here
10 save it it says the factorial is
three six two double eight double zero
or it's 36 lakh twenty eight thousand
eight hundred so if you try to multiply
10 into 9 into 8 into 7 so until 2 or we
can say 1 the answer will be this you
can check it you can Google it or you
can go through it in your calculator
for today's session the topic of
discussion is how to become a back-end
developer
so if you're wondering how to become a
backend developer what skills are
required and what the responsibilities
are then you're in the right place
but let's wait for a while for more
people to tune in
I'd also like to thank all our viewers
for actively participating in these
sessions
all right so uh whilst you're at it if
you haven't subscribed to our Channel
already make sure to hit the Subscribe
button and the bell icon to never miss
an update okay so I see a lot of people
tuning in
all right so I think we're good to begin
now I'm sure all of you use social media
applications now every time you click on
a video scroll through a feed perhaps
search for something the corresponding
information is displayed on your screen
now these applications provide an
excellent user experience
but how is this achieved
you must know that every application
comprises of two parts does the front
end and then there's the back end
the front end is what the user deals
with and the back end is what makes this
happen
in other words the back end includes an
application a server and a database the
backend application fetches the data
from the database and processes all
client requests the result of this is
made visible to the user
so now the question arises who is a
back-end developer
a back-end developer's role is to focus
on details like building an effective
website architecture scripting and
writing code that serves as a means of
communication between the website's
database and the browser
and lastly to ensure data integrity and
consistency
so now let's look at the skills required
to become a pack-in developer
it is vital for you to have good
understanding of programming Concepts
like data structures and algorithms this
includes Stacks cues linked lists trees
and graphs sorting algorithms and search
algorithms
next up is programming languages and
Frameworks one of the most critical
skills of a back-end developer is a
depth of knowledge in back-end
programming languages
this includes Proficiency in JavaScript
and its environments like node.js and
express.js
next is Java this language was
particularly built from the ground up to
be run on server side
popular Frameworks include spring and
Java server faces
next up is python which is the most
popularly used language today it is
flexible and easy to use Python
Frameworks like Django and floss are
used for back-end development
and lastly there's C sharp and its
Frameworks like asp.net core and asp.net
MVC
other languages include Perl PHP and
Ruby now because back-end and front-end
developers work so closely together it
is also helpful to have a foundational
understanding of front-end web languages
like HTML and CSS
now proficiency is essential not only
for performing daily tasks but also for
working alongside front-end Developers
for developing Solutions
next we have database Management Systems
a back-end developer writes code that is
used to perform relational mapping to
fetch data from the database
some popularly used dbms or MySQL SQL
server and postgresql next up is Version
Control
again popular ones are git and sub
version they help manage the project
files and keep track of the entire
history of things that the developer is
working on
and lastly This Cloud hosting platforms
these platforms allow you to deploy your
product on the cloud service provider so
that it can be accessed from the World
Wide Web
most popular ones are Amazon web
services Google Cloud platform Heroku
and Microsoft azure
of course there are non-technical skills
that are required of back-end developers
those who choose this profession should
be comfortable with analytical processes
have well-developed problem solving
capabilities be interested in emerging
technologies have good communication
skills and be able to work independently
and sometimes as a part of a
collaborative team
now that you're familiar with the skills
let's have a look at the
responsibilities of a back-end developer
first up is forming an understanding of
the performance needs and goals of the
website to develop effective successful
Solutions
development and management of
application programming interfaces
development of systems for websites to
accept and securely store data such as
those required for payment processing
systems
then there's writing code testing and
development solutions for correlated
issues
then this organization of system logic
other responsibilities also include
development of site architecture using
proper methodologies like agile scrum
framework and also providing solutions
to system problems
lastly let's have a look at the salaries
of a back-end developer
the average salary of a back-end
developer in the United States is around
102 000 US dollars per year the average
salary of a back-end developer in India
is around 7 lakhs 23 000 Indian rupees
per annum in this session we're gonna
cover the topic of what is angular
I'm sure all of you use mobile and web
applications create from social media to
healthcare e-commerce and net banking
these apps are used by billions of
people across the globe now the main
reason we use these apps is that they
offer seamless user experience and
interface with holiday developed to
provide such reliability one of the
Frameworks that is widely used to build
such robust apps is angular so let's
dive into the session now so here is a
list of topics that we're going to be
covering first up we'll see why angular
was introduced then what is angular
features of angular
angular architecture advantages and
limitations of angular
the learning curve of angular and
finally we look at some of the companies
that deploy angular so without further
delay let's begin
why angular now JavaScript is the most
commonly used client-side scripting
language it is written in two HTML
documents enabling interactions with web
pages in many unique ways
so as a relatively easy to learn
language with almost pervasive support
it is exceptionally well suited to
develop modern applications but the
question arises
is Javascript ideal for developing
single page applications that require
modularity testability and other
features perhaps not however we have a
variety of Frameworks and libraries
designed to help us with such thing with
respect to front-end development angular
and JavaScript together bring in
structure and consistency to your web
applications and also provide
scalability and maintainability
and angular is specifically developed
for single page applications another
question arises what exactly is angular
angular angular is an
old JavaScript framework written
completely in typescript
now it was primarily aimed to develop
single page applications and is
maintained by Google
angular as a framework provides a few
advantages while also providing a
standard structure for Developers
designed for web desktop and mobile
platforms
forms a doubt here as to what exactly
single
page are that help you with that now
these single page applications are
basically applications that get loaded
just once so the main page gets loaded
onto your browser so any further
interactions does not lead to loading of
subsequent Pages anything that has to be
done further is just an addition to the
already loaded page these single page
applications are primarily developed
using angular moving ahead let's look at
the features of angular
we have four features that we're going
to be discussing we have the document
object model type script data binding
and testing now let's look at them one
by one now the document object model
treats an XML or an HTML document as a
tree structure now here every node in
the tree structure defines an object
representing a part of your document
angular uses the regular Dom now let's
suppose you've made 10 updates on a
single HTML page
so every time you make a change the
corresponding Dom or the tree structure
needs to be updated
now angular updates the entire tree
structure of HTML tags
moving on to our next feature
we have typescript
now typescript defines a set of types to
JavaScript which helps you write
JavaScript that is easier to understand
now all the typescript code compiles
down to basic JavaScript that can run
smoothly on any platform now typescript
is not mandatory for developing an
angular application but it is highly
recommended the main reason is highly
recommended is that it offers better
syntactic structure while making the
code base easier to understand and
maintain now typescript can be as an npm
package now to do that you just have to
run the command npm install hyphen G
type script on your command prompt let
next up is data binding now data binding
is a process that allows you to
manipulate web page elements using the
web browser now it mainly employs
Dynamic HTML and does not require
complex scripting or programming
it is used in web pages that include
interactive components like calculators
tutorials Games Etc now incremental
display of a web page makes data binding
extremely convenient when Pages contain
a large amount of data when it comes to
angular
it uses two-way data binding
index meet in the UI element is
reflected in the corresponding model
state
and conversely any changes made in the
model state are reflected onto the UI
state
allows the framework to connect to Tom
to the model data via the controller the
last feature we're discussing is testing
angular uses Jasmine to run its various
tests the Jasmine framework allows
various functionalities to write
different kinds of test cases karma is a
task runner for the tests that use a
configuration file to set the startup
reporters and testing framework so with
that we'll cover the features of angular
so let's go ahead and understand
the architecture of angular
angular is a full-fledged MVC framework
it provides a strong opinion on how the
application should be structured and
offers bi-directional data flow and
updates the real Dom MEC short for model
view controller is an architectural
pattern that separates the application
layer into model view and controller a
model here relates to all the data
related logic view on the other hand is
used for UI logic of the application
and controller is the brain of the setup
now it is an interface between the model
and view
moving on let's look at the advantages
of angular
first up we have custom components
angular allows you to build your own
components that can pack functionality
along with rendering logic into reusable
pieces
data binding as discussed angular allows
you to effortlessly move your data from
your JavaScript code to the view and
react to user events without having to
write any code yourself
dependency injection angular allows you
to write modular services and have them
injected wherever they are needed this
greatly improves the testability and
reusability of the same don't worry if
you can't wrap your head around these
Pockets we're going to discuss them
further in the coming videos
next Advantage is testing angular has
been built from the ground up with
testability in mind you can literally
test every part of your application
comprehensive angular is a full-fledged
framework and provides out of the box
solutions for Server communication
routing and more
lastly we have excellent browser
compatibility angular is cross-platform
and browser compatible
an angular application can typically run
on all browsers with chrome Firefox
Safari and platforms like Windows Mac OS
and Linux now many versions of angular
have been released ever since its
Inception all of these versions have
added to the efficient working of the
framework now here are the different
versions released first up use angular
1. it was built on JavaScript and
completely based on controllers next
release was angular 2. now this
Incorporated the component based
approach wherein the entire UI was
divided into several components and
lastly integrated to give the final
logic next was angular 4 it included
draft adaptation angular CLI or command
line interface 1.0 was introduced
however not deployed in this release the
angular CLI was optimized and commands
like NG update and NG add were added
the angular 7 released prompts were
introduced which provided tips in CLI
about the functions being used
in angular 8 IV renderer and bazel were
introduced
and finally the most recent release was
angular 9. now this came with the better
framework and angular material now this
completely switched to the IV renderer
as a default compiler now that we've
learned about the pros of using angular
let's look at some of the limitations of
angle
first up is a steep learning curve now
since angular is a complete full-fledged
framework it becomes difficult for
Learners to begin with you need to be
acquainted with simple topics and then
move on to more advanced topics to
become proficient in this language
except is limited SEO auctions now
angular offers limited SEO options and
poor accessibility to search engine
Crawlers
it were both and complex have a common
issue faced by the angular Community is
the verbosity of the framework
it also poses to be complex compared to
other front-end tools
and lastly migration
now one of the drawbacks of
our poor migration
now it becomes difficult to Port Legacy
code to angular style architecture also
with each new release it is painful to
upgrade and a lot of them are not
Backward Compatible
next up let's look at the angular
learning curve
now if you wish to learn angular you
need to be acquainted with basic topics
in angular some of them are directors
modules decorators components Services
dependency injection pipes and templates
now once you've mastered your Basics you
will want to go and understand more
advanced topics such as change detection
zones aot compilation and RX dot JS
however the learning curve of angular is
clear-cut in the beginning it could be a
little intimidating but once you start
using the tool becomes way more easier
to comprehend and understand what is
going on
and lastly let's look at some of the
companies that use angular today
many top tier companies like Nike Forbes
Google HBO Sony upwork among others
readily deploy angular so moving on
let's look at the prerequisites for
angular
first up we have node.js angular uses
node.js as its base for a large part of
its build environment
so as a result to get started with
angular you will need to have node.js
installed on your environment so head to
their official website and download the
latest release for your corresponding
operating system next up is the angular
CLI now this command line interface is a
tool that makes it easier to bootstrap
and develop your angular applications
now to install the latest version run
the command npm install hyphen G at
angular front slash CLI we call it run
this command on your command prompt and
finally to confirm installation check
for its version
now the next thing that you will need is
an IDE or a text editor to type your
code now there are several Ides that you
can choose from but in this series we've
used vs code throughout so it is
available on all platforms so go ahead
and download it if you haven't already
now moving on to the final part is the
demo now that you have a basic
understanding of angular and its
prerequisites I think you're ready to
create your first angular application so
let's head to our vs code and begin here
I've created a folder called angular on
my desktop and opened it on my visual
studio code so to create your app you
need to open the terminal just go here
and
select new terminal
and now type in the command Ng
new
and provide the name for your app so I'm
just gonna say hello world
so now this is going to create
if you see yes
so basically what happens is that when
you run the command it will
automatically generate a skeleton
application under the folder that is
Hello World in our case and it includes
a bunch of files and installs all the
necessary dependencies for the angular
application
so this could take a while
so once you've created your application
to run it first change the directory so
let's say CD
hello world
and now use the command NG so
now once it's compiled you need to go to
your browser and type in localhost 4200
and once you do that
you can see your UI
you can see that the application has
been loaded onto your browser and it
says hello world app is running
so this is how you create your
application
so let's go back to our vs code now as
you can see here
there are many files and folders that
are created right so let's look at a few
of them of course we can't explain
everything but I'll brush through a few
of them
so the first main component is basically
the root component now the root
component here is the index.html
so here if you open the file and see
it's a very small crisp code right but
the most important thing in the file is
this app Root element
so what this does is it's basically the
marker for loading your application code
so this is extremely important so the
next important file is the main.ts now
this is the part of the bootstrapping
piece all right so the index.html file
is responsible for deciding which files
are to be loaded correct the main.ts
file on the other hand identifies which
angular module is to be loaded when the
application starts so this is just a
brief explanation as to what they're
doing
next we have the app folder now here we
have the app dot module.ts file now this
application module file can be thought
of as a code configuration of your
application
so here's where the source code starts
from and moving on we have the
app.component.ts these are all
typescript files hence the extension TS
now this file basically is the root
component of your application and then
we have the HTML file for the same which
defines the appearance of what you can
see on your browser so let me just
change the message that is being
displayed
so I'll say hey
welcome to this
angular
tutorial so let's save this and when we
go back to our browser
we can see the message hey welcome to
this angular tutorial being displayed so
like this we can make a simple change
and then it gets rendered onto your
browser so this was just a brief
explanation of what happens in the
background of your application
first we'll get acquainted to what
exactly angular components are then I'll
help you create an angular component by
showing a quick demo and lastly we'll
learn about component decorator metadata
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our Channel if you love
watching new and interesting technology
videos also hit the Bell icon to never
miss an update so what exactly are
angular components
now I'm sure everybody uses web
applications and one of the most widely
used applications is Gmail correct now
to help you understand what components
are consider them as Lego blocks now
they basically are combined together to
form the final application so in this
case here we have the logo component
then you have a sign in component an
image component and then a create
account component now all of these
components generally don't affect the
working of each other but however when
embedded they Define the UI of your
application
so I hope you understood what components
are so to go ahead let's discuss some of
its common features now firstly they are
the building blocks of an application
generally you have a root component
which is basically the app component and
then it branches out into other
components creating a hierarchy
and these components are a subset of
directives now don't worry about what
deductives are because we'll cover them
later on in the series but to give you
an idea there are three types of
directors you have the structural
directives the attribute directors and
the component directors
only one component can be instantiated
per element in a template now components
are typically custom HTML elements and
each of these elements can instantiate
only one component
now don't worry you'll understand this
better when I show you the demo
nextly a typescript class is used to
create a component now this class is
then decorated with the at component
decorator Now The Decorator accepts a
metadata object that gives information
about the component now a component must
belong to the NG module in order for it
to be usable by another component or
application
and finally components control their
runtime Behavior by implementing life
cycle hooks so this was just a brief
introduction to what annular components
are
now you will only be able to understand
the working of components when I show it
to you practically so let's head over to
a Visual Studio code now here back in my
vs code I've created a folder called
angular demo within which I've created
an angular application called demo
components once executed the browser
looks something like this so if you
haven't watched our previous video on
getting started with angular that is
angular hello world I highly suggest you
go through that video first it helps you
create your first angular application so
um now let's go ahead and create our
first component now the command used to
create our component is NG GC and your
component name once executed it creates
four different files now let's just see
how this works on RVs code now what you
can do is head to your terminal and type
in the command Ng
g c
and provide a name for your component
for example I'm gonna just call my
component text component all right
so what it does is that it creates four
different files you can see you have
four different files that have been
created and finally it updates the file
that is app.module.ts indicating that
this new component has been created so
here in your Source folder within which
is an app folder and again here you can
see that your four different files have
been created first is the HTML file
wherein you can Define all the code that
you want for your component next you
have the CSS file for your styling then
you have the dot TS file which includes
the component decorator and finally you
have spec.ts which is basically a unit
test file all right and then in your
app.module.ts you can observe that the
component that you've created that is
text component has been imported that is
what the message conveys here all right
now let's go back to our
app.component.html now this basically
has all the code for your applications
so so let me just get rid of it
and I'm just gonna display a basic
heading saying
hello
welcome all right so let me save it and
if you go ahead and look at your browser
hello welcome message is displayed now
let's go back to our
component.html file and here let me
provide a message
[Music]
let me say h
3
and let me display a message saying
welcome to this tutorial
on angular components all right now in
your text component dot TS file which is
your typescript file the selector
mentioned here is app hyphen text
component now go ahead and copy this
and in your final
comprint.html go ahead and create your
custom HTML tag with the selector that
you just copied now this indicates that
the component that you just created that
is the text component is being
Incorporated in the final render
so what happens is that whatever is
defined in the component.html file is
also being rendered in your final output
so when I say this let's go ahead and
check
our browser you can see that the message
welcome to this tutorial on angular
components is displayed so this was a
simple creation of a component now for
this let's give it some styling so here
go to your dot CSS file and provide some
styling say for example here I just say
text line
and let me say Center and also in my
app.component.cs I'm going to give the
same thing and see each one
text align is Center
all right so let me save this
and there we go
now we can also create multiple
components and Define the tags in the
app component now the components are
executed sequentially so now let's
create another component just to give
you a brief insight into it let's say NG
GC image component
now here I'm going to be adding the
simply learn logo so I'll show you how
that works
now you can see that a new component has
been created with four files again so in
my assets folder here I've added the
logo so what I can do is back in my HTML
file I can go ahead and create an image
tag so first let me just display another
message here
just to avoid any confusion and let me
say this is the image component
[Music]
and then let me say
image
Source equals so the source is basically
assets
[Music]
slash logo
dot PNG
and class
equals
Center
[Music]
all right so you can also head to your
CSS file and provide any sort of styling
that you need so let me just say
text
align
to be Center
and then let's create a styling for the
image
and here I mentioned the code for the
image
so let's save this and from the dot CS
file let's copy the selector
and create a custom HTML tag in our
final component.html file
so there we go let's save this and check
the output
and there we go first the hello welcome
message is displayed next you have the
message displayed from the first
component and then you have the second
component so this is how you can create
your own components and don't forget to
incorporate these selectors into your
final HTML file so moving on to our next
topic component decorator metadata now
as mentioned earlier the at component
decorator accepts a metadata object that
provides information about the component
correct here is a list of properties of
the metadata object first up is the
selector now basically the selector is a
CSS selector that identifies this
particular component in a template now
this corresponds to the HTML tag that is
included in the parent component you can
create your own HTML tag however the
same has to be included in the parent
component so to help you understand that
better let's head back to our vs code
and say for example in our text
component
here
the selector says text component correct
for the time being let's change it to
say n component
all right now when you save it and look
at the browser the message is not
displayed so what we can do is you can
copy this
selector and then include this
here
and now you can see that the same
component has been rendered onto your
output
all right so the selector plays a
crucial role in that
next up we have the template now a
template is an inline defined template
for the view now the template can be
used to provide some particular markup
the markup could typically include some
headings or paragraphs that are
displayed on the UI
next up we have template URL now it is
the URL for the external file containing
the template for The View so here you
can see
this is basically the external file that
contains the template for the view next
up you have Styles now these are also
inline defined styles that can be
applied to the components view so any
code that you provide in the dot CSS
file can also be included here
next you have the style URLs now this is
a list of URLs to your style sheets that
are applied on your components View
next up you have providers now this is
again an array where certain Services
can be registered for your component
lastly we have animations as the name
suggests these are animations that can
be listed for your components
first we'll understand what exactly
dependency injection is
then we'll understand the demerit or the
drawback of not using dependency
injection
then we'll understand dependency
injection as a design pattern and
finally I'll help you understand the
entire concept with the help of a demo
so let's begin
what exactly is dependency injection so
let's consider this I'm sure you are
aware that angular uses the concept of
components the entire UI of the
application is divided into several
components now what have all of these
components perform similar tasks be it
accessing the database rendering images
Etc now instead of writing the same
piece of code for every component you
could write the code once and then
perhaps inject the same code into every
component
now this is supported by dependency
injection
now to give you a better example
consider two classes A and B now let's
assume that a uses the objects of Class
B and normally in object oriented
programming an instance of Class B is
created so that a can access its objects
with using dependency injection we move
the creation and binding of dependent
objects outside of the class that depend
on them so dependency injection or di
keeps the core more flexible testable
and mutable also classes can inherit
external logic without having to create
on its own and lastly GI benefits
directives pipes and components
next up let's have a look at the
drawback of not using dependency
injection
now let's consider Class Postal details
that is dependent on the number and the
address class
in the postal details class the
Constructor creates copies of the number
and address
so when you instantiate a new postal
details class the Constructor
instantiates a unique number and address
now although this looks simple there's a
problem with this code let's assume that
the number and address class
Constructors now accept parameters when
we change the numbers class the postal
details class gets broken now to
overcome this what we need to do is we
need to pass parameter to the number
Constructor so this applies to address
as well the first drawback of using this
traditional method is that the code is
not very flexible anytime the
dependencies change the postal details
class needs to be changed as well
and the second drawback is that the code
is not suitable for testing
once you instantiate the new postal
details class you get the same number
and address even if you change the
number and address classes every time
what if these classes are in turn
dependent on other classes
then it's going to be a chain reaction
so to overcome this we make use of
dependency injection
now let's look at di as a pattern
dependency injection as you all know is
a coding pattern where class receives
its dependencies from an external Source
rather than creating them on its own so
here in the above example we have moved
the definition of dependencies from
inside the Constructor to the
constructor's parameters so the postal
details class doesn't create the
dependencies anymore
it just consumes them so the postal
dependencies class doesn't create the
dependencies anymore
so with that we overcome the drawbacks
of not using Di
so now that you know what exactly
dependency injection is and how vital it
is let's look at a simple demonstration
to understand the concept better now
services classes modules components all
of these are benefactors of dependency
injection so in the demo I'm going to be
showing how dependency injection can be
used with the help of services and
injecting these Services into classes so
the main thought behind this is normally
components are used to ensure just a
good user experience these components do
not generally execute tasks so to
execute these tasks we make use of
services so a component can delegate
tasks like fetching data from the server
any network related issues
ETC to a particular service and these
Services can be made available to
components with the same thought what
I'm going to be doing is I'll be
creating a service that performs the
task of displaying an employee list
later we're going to inject the service
into the class using dependency
injection
so let's head to our Visual Studio code
for the demonstration
all right so as discussed I'll have to
first create a component that displays a
button for the employee and then I have
to create a service class and inject it
into my component now this service holds
the employee details such as name
employee ID email ID
Etc so first let's go ahead and create a
component
so here let me just type
NG GC and the name of the component I'm
providing is M info
if getting your learning started is have
to battle what if you could do that for
free visit scale up by simply learn
click on the link in the description to
know more
so as you can
you can print with four different files
all right so the next thing we have to
do is we have to create a service so to
create that we make use of the command n
g g s
you can either give s or service and the
service name I'm providing is records so
let me just say records here
all right here you can see two files are
created there is a spect.ts file and the
dot TS file all right so now the service
contains all the employee data that
needs to be displayed right so let's go
ahead and write the data so first we're
going to make use of three arrays I'm
going to be displaying employee records
for three employees so I'll have to
create three arrays and provide certain
information so let's go ahead and do
that
all right so the array I'm creating is
called info one for the first employee
and I'm going to be passing
information like name employee ID and
the email ID so the arrays of type
string
and within which let me just mention the
details I'm giving random information
I'm just saying Adam Taylor
and some random
employee ID
and let's say 80 at abc.net
all right so I'm going to be creating
three records so I'll just copy the same
thing and paste with the rest too
change here
provide a different name here
and same for the last one
[Music]
and let me change the name of the array
as well
all right so with the agenda to retrieve
this data in our component we make use
of the method for the same right so this
method Returns the employee data
so let's go ahead and create this method
I'm going to call it get info
and then just say string
and then this will just return
this dot info one
all right I'm gonna be calling it get
info one for better understanding
same for the rest too as well
I'm just gonna return different arrays
here
order and lastly info three all right
now in order to retrieve this
information in our component we need
three more arrays right three more
arrays that will receive this data let's
go back to our component dot TS file
here and then type in the following code
so I've created three arrays again or
info received one two and three
now what we need to do is we have to
accept the information that is being
sent from the service correct now as I
mentioned services are implemented with
the help of dependency injection so what
we need to do is we'll have to first
import the service into the component.ts
file the key reason behind doing this is
that when angular creates this component
and instance of the service class is
also made to perform the necessary tasks
correct so let's go ahead and just
import it here
so I'll say import
[Music]
records
services
I'm sorry service
from
and let's say records.service
all right and what we have to do next is
that we must also declare this instance
that is being created in the provider's
array of the component
all right so
let's just say providers
and then say records
service
all right now we've created the instance
of this class right however to access
this instance an object is also created
so this object will in turn access the
methods and variables of the service
class so for that we have to create
another object so let's do that here in
our Constructor method let's say
Constructor
private
and the object I'm creating is called
our service you can give a name
of your choice and then I'm gonna just
say records service
all right now this object will help me
retrieve data from the service so let's
go ahead and use this in order to get
the employee details all right so I've
created three different methods here get
info from service class 2 1 and 3 and
these methods will retrieve the data and
add it to our array here that is info
received all right and lastly
we'll have to create an unordered list
in our HTML file here we haven't added
anything so let me get rid of this
so now I have to create three different
buttons for three different employees
and when the user clicks on the button
the data is retrieved from the service
and then displayed on the UI right
so as you can see I've created buttons
for three different employees
and then I've made use of a bootstrap
class called list group info and then
I've
interpolated info which displays the
contents
of the info variable all right now in
order to call the methods in the dot TS
file we have to bind them with the
button so since it is bound with the
click event every time you click on the
button the information is displayed
so now the last thing we have to do is
we'll have to create a custom HTML tag
for the component and then add it to the
main component
so let's just do that
let me copy this here
and then in my app component.html let me
get rid of this
and then let me just create this I've
just created the custom HTML tag for my
component
and now just to beautify the code I'll
write a heading
and let's say employee
details
and then I'll also add the simply learn
logo
say image source
[Music]
I've I've added the image here so let me
just say logo
dot PNG
I've also added some styling to it all
right so now let me just save this and
have a look at the browser
so here we go we have the logo here and
then employee details heading and then
we have three different buttons created
that is employee one two and three and
when I click on it
the information of the employee is
displayed the name the ID and their
email address
so yeah so this is how you can make use
of dependency injection and inject a
service class into a component
dependency injection plays a crucial
role in angular
we'll understand what angular forms are
then we look at the different types of
form building supported by angular next
up we'll get acquainted with features
like form control and group control
and we learn all of this with the help
of a simple demo
so without further Ado let's begin
so what exactly are angular forms
now I'm sure every application that you
use comes with certain amount of form
filling correct be it your login
credentials or your sign up forms or any
sort of registration forms Etc so forms
are an integral part of a web
application unique forms to update your
profile or to enter sensitive
information are also to perform any sort
of data related tasks so now let's look
at the different types of form building
supported by angular
first up angular supports two types of
form building
first you have the template driven
approach and second you have the
reactive approach
now let's look at them one by one so
talking about template driven approach
in this method the conventional form tag
is used to create forms so angular
automatically interprets and creates a
form object with the help of the
directors
Now controls can be added to the form
using the NG model tag now multiple
controls can be grouped using the NG
control group module so it basically
uses several module classes to provide
controls now if you don't get this don't
worry you'll understand better when I am
showing you the demo
next up is Json values so form value can
be generated using the form dot value
object
form data is exported as Json values
when the sublip method is called
lastly basic HTML validations can be
used to validate the form fields in the
case of custom validations directives
can be used so arguably this method is
the simplest way to create an angular
form
so moving on to the active approach now
this approach is the programming
Paradigm revolving around data flows and
propagation of change
now with reactive forms the component
directly manages the data flows between
the form controls and the data models
now reactive forms are code driven
unlike template driven approach
reactive forms eliminate the
anti-pattern of updating the data model
via two-way data banding so it does not
use two-way data binding
and typically a reactive form control
creation is synchronous and can be unit
tested with synchronous programming
techniques
so now let's go ahead and look at form
control and form group
so consider a typical form consisting of
fields like name age and location
now a form control is basically a class
that enables validation of these fields
for each input field an instance of this
class is created now these instances
help check the values of the field and
see if they are either touched untouched
dirty pristine valid invalid and so on
so this allows you to check every field
for the value it makes it easier to
understand which Fields value is invalid
or which field has not been entered
Etc
now moving on to form group
so a form group class represents a group
of controls a form can have multiple
group controls the form group returns
true if all the controls are valid and
provides validation errors if there are
any so I hope this was clear
so moving ahead let's look at the demo
to explain all of these features I'm
sure it will become extremely clear once
you look at the demo so for that let's
head to our vs code
so back in my vs code
I've created a component called form
component
and I've also included the simply learn
logo just to purify the appearance so
once you execute the code
this is what you want to see on your
browser so you just have the logo at the
moment
the first thing we need to do is we'll
have to import the forms module all
right so oh uh but before we begin let
me tell you what the use case is so
we're going to be creating a user
registration form which is going to
include four fields that is the first
name and last name email ID and the
password all right so now let me show
you how to import the forms module so in
your main
app.module.ts file you will have to
import forms module from angular forms
all right and then in your Imports
you'll have to just call it here
all right so this is just a simple step
and now once you're done with that let's
go ahead and start our form creation
so here in my component.html let's
enclose the entire form within a div tag
so here let me say div
class
as a container
within which let me just have one
heading
which says user registration
all right and now let's go ahead and
create our form
so first let me just say form
now I'm going to create a div class for
every field so say div
class
equals form group
I'll explain it to you a little later
now first let's create a label
so label tag
for
basically it's the first name
so let me just say first name
and the tab will basically have
first name again
all right and let me just break the line
next we have the field so let's say
input
type is text
name is
first name
and we have a class which is
the form control class
all right
so this we have to do for all the other
fields so let me just copy this
and
paste it like four times
I'll also add the tag 3 for spacing
let's do that here
and finally we'll have the button
so let's just add that here
with a type submit
and let's just say submit on the button
so now let's go ahead and change these
values here
so here let me just change it to last
name
here as well
and here as well
and in this case it is going to be email
so let me just change it here
and finally we have passwords so
let's add that here
all right so let's save this and just
have a look at our browser
so there we go we have our uh user
registration form ready but I would like
to uh align it to the center so let me
just do that
so here in my CSS file
I'm just going to uh align all the div
tags in the center and the label tag to
the left so let me save this and look at
the browser now
and there we go we have our registration
form was a logo so this is how you
create a simple form
now we'll have to add a directive called
NG model now this directive when added
into the input tag will provide form
controls to every input field all right
so here let's just go ahead and say NG
model
that is it
so let me just copy this and paste it
for every other field
all right let me save this and back in
my browser let me inspect
and here you can see different types of
classes like NG untouched NG pristine NG
ballot are added right so this indicates
that angular has recognized the form Tab
and it has added these classes to the
form as well as all the fields
so this is achieved when you add the NG
model directive in your input tag now
back in my vs code now every form has an
output property attached to it called NG
submit all right so this property can be
bound within a method that method called
the subwit method
so once submitted this method is called
right so once we click on the submit
button this method has to be called so
to include that
we'll have to just say
form
NG submit
equals
submit
[Music]
all right so now we have to define the
submit method
in our component.ts file so here let me
just go to our component.ts file and let
me
just get rid of unnecessary code here
and let's define a function
or submit
and then here let me just
console log
form submitted
all right so let me just get rid of this
as well it's unnecessary here
let's save this so what it means is that
every time you click on the submit
button
this method is called all right so let's
just have a look at the browser so first
let's go to our console
and when I click on submit it says form
submitted
all right so the next crucial step is to
generate JavaScript representation now
we'll have to make use of another
directive called NG form that is
assigned to a template variable
okay so this JavaScript representation
helps with validating all the fields so
I'll help you understand that better
so back in our HTML file
let's just create a variable first
let's call it login
all right and say Ng
form
okay now the mg form object includes the
JavaScript representation so now while
you're calling the submit method you're
going to pass login as a parameter
so let's just say login here
and in my ts file again let's just say
login
and along with it
I won't login to be displayed so
I say login again
so now let's save this
and if you have a look at the browser
let's click on submit
and now here you can see the JavaScript
representation So within form
I can
check for email
or say first name and here for this
field first name you can see different
properties attached you can see invalid
is it invalid or is it untouched
which is true or are there any errors so
this basically gives you all information
about the particular field
so we can make use of this feature to
validate the information so we're going
to learn about that in our next segment
moving on to form validation one way to
ensure that incorrect fields are not
submitted is by disabling the submit
button
correct now apart from this you can also
specify certain properties in your input
tag for the corresponding input field
now um let's say that the fields that
now let's say that the fields can't be
empty and the form only accepts names
with the minimum length of 2 and the
maximum length of 7. all right so here
in my input tag I just mentioned a
required meaning this field cannot be
empty
and Min length
to 2
and
max length
to say 7.
all right
so to check this
let's go to our browser
and here
let me submit the form without fill in
the first name
and evidently there has to be an error
so when I submit it
and I look here
what's in forms and here controls
and my first name you can see that an
error is shown here it says required
equals true that means that there is one
error now you can make use of these form
control objects you can leverage form
control objects to ensure field
validation and display a message
whenever an error occurs
right so to do that you need to access
these objects like errors or invalid or
touched all of these properties or
objects need to be
accessed for that we'll have to create a
template variable
and then this variable is assigned to
this object so back in our vs code
let's create
a variable let me call it
name
and let's say NG model
all right here the readable name
receives the control object
so here back in my browser when I submit
again without the first name
you can see that the invalid
property is set to True correct so this
helps us use this property to alert the
user with the help of a simple if logic
so back in my vs code let me create
another div tag
within which I mentioned NG if
in which I'm going to use a simple if
logic so let's say MGF
name which is our template variable name
dot touched
and name dot invalid
is true
right then I'm going to alert
so I'm gonna
make use of an alert
here let's say
alert
Danger
all right
so in my CSS file I'll have to mention
the simple styling for alert
so here let me just say
so we're gonna have the background color
red
for danger right and here I'm gonna
display the message
invalid in bold
so now let's go back to our browser and
check it
so let me proceed without entering the
last name it says invalid here
so this was a simple demonstration to
show you form validation
of course you can modify the code
depending on your requirement say
suppose the length of the first name is
too short then you can alert the user
with a different message or uh suppose
they have missed out on filling a form
field then you can again alert the user
so you can basically make use of the
nested if condition right now just to
help you understand that better let me
just show it to you
now back in my HTML file
instead of invalid let me have another
tag a paragraph tag
within which I make use of NG if again
now ngf
name dot errors
[Music]
dot required
is true
then I display the message first
name required
all right
and if
the length of the first name is
not 2.
now if the length of the first name is
less than 2 then I'm going to display
another message so let me just say
name dot errors
dot Min length
if this is true then I'm going to say
sorry
short
first name
all right so let's save this and have a
look at the browser
when I proceed without providing the
name it says first name required but
when I type in one character it says
sorry short first name but if I type in
another character it accepts so I hope
this made you understand how form
validation works
so this was just a simple demonstration
again now I highly recommend you explore
these properties and play around with
these objects uh trust me it's really
fun so I hope this tutorial helped you
out
first let's have a look at the basics of
routing
now I'm sure that you've observed that
the URL changes every time you click on
a particular link or on an icon on the
user interface correct now this
basically indicates that you are
navigating throughout the application
now to achieve this navigation we use a
mechanism called routing routing is
essentially used to navigate through a
website or a web application
but how is it achieved in angular
especially in angular routing plays a
major role it is used to create a single
page applications now these applications
are loaded just once and new content is
added dynamically applications like
Google Facebook Twitter and Gmail are a
few examples of single page applications
the best part of using single page
applications is that it provides an
excellent user experience and you don't
even have to wait for new pages to load
which by extension makes single page
applications extremely fast but how is
this new content loaded
enter routing now routing is the
mechanism that as discussed earlier that
is used to navigate through the
application and load new content
routing helps angular configure the
route and the component that needs to be
displayed
now I'm sure you're going to understand
the concept of routing better when you
work on it Hands-On
so in the demo we're going to be
navigating to the login and the home
pages of a web application with the help
of routing
so let's head to our Visual Studio code
so basically the objective of our
application is to navigate to home and
the login pages so when I click on the
login icon here it loads the login page
and here you can see the extension
slash login and similarly with home once
you click on it some new information
gets added and the URL changes
with a slash home appended all right so
this is the main objective of our
application so to create it let's head
back to our vs code all right so here
I've created a folder called demo and
underscore angular and I've created a
file called demo routing
now the first thing you want to do is
open the index.html file and make sure
that the base tag is added now although
this is generally
added when your app is created if it is
not then add a base tag with href
attribute which is set to a forward
slash
all right now this is generally done to
tell angular to construct the URL while
navigating with a forward slash all
right and the next thing you want to do
is open your app dot module.ts file and
check if the app routing module has been
imported if not go ahead and import it
and then also mention it in your Imports
array
or with that or the initial setup is
done Now to create the nav bar the code
that I'm going to be using is already
explained in the previous video that is
angular bootstrap I highly suggest you
go through that video before watching
this
so uh the code is already available I'm
just going to create a component and
write the code for it
and paste the code in it so let's do
that
let me say NG GC
navbar
[Music]
alright so this component is now created
now here in my HTML file
I'll just get rid of this and paste the
code for the nav bar
so here we go I've pasted the code for
the navigation bar
and back in my
app.component.html file I'll just remove
all The Unwanted code here and just
specify the
custom HTML tag for my nav bar
so
so let me just create one here
all right let me save this let me just
run the application and see if it's
displaying correctly
all right so when I open the browser the
navigation bar has been created
along with these different options
that's home about services and login
all right and we also have the simply
learn icon here all right now the next
step is to generate the components to
display the login page content and the
home page content
now again I have used bootstrap to
define the user interface for these
files you can easily find the code
online just search for a bootstrap login
templates and depending on your
requirements you can choose the
appropriate one
so first let's create the components for
by two files that is for the home
component
and the login component
so
let's go ahead and do that
[Music]
nggc
I'm just going to call it login for my
login component
all right and then I'm gonna say nggc
home for the home component
all right
so I'm just going to copy the code for
the login component
so back in my login.html
file
I'll just paste the code here
okay
also note that I've added the simply
learn logo in my assets folder
and then just provided the source for it
here in my login component
all right
so next up is the home component
and if you've seen the previous video
that is angular bootstrap you might have
seen that we created three different
components that is intro courses and
footer which included the content for
the intro message for the courses and
the photo message correct so here we're
going to just paste the code for all of
these three
and then just display it when the home
button is clicked
all right so what I'm going to do is
I'll just paste it here
[Music]
so this basically has all the content
one thing I want to tell you is that in
the previous video we made sure that the
code was written in three different
components however for this I've just
added all the code in the same component
now I agree that this is not the best
practice so if you want you can go ahead
and create three different components
and separate the code into these three
components and just add the custom HTML
tags in your home component
I'm just hoping you're uh following me
right now and also here in my assets
folder I have added a video and the
YouTube logo that needs to be displayed
uh when the home icon is clicked all
right so now that we've created the home
and the login components the next step
is to configure the routes for the
application right so here you can see
that we have a file called app routing
module.ts file
so here we have the routes and the
router module that is imported and we
also have a constant called routes which
is strongly typed two routes from the
router package
all right now this array is used to
define all the possible routes in the
application now each route is basically
an object with a path
so here in my routes array I'm just
going to go ahead and create the paths
that is we have two different routes
right one is for login and one is for
home so I'm just gonna create a path
object so let's say path
sorry within curly braces I say path
foreign
this is basically what will appear uh on
the URL all right and the component that
needs to be
navigated to is nothing but the login
component
so let me just say login
component as you can see the login
component has been automatically
imported
now same with
uh the Home Path so let me just say
path
home
and the component that needs to be
rendered is the home component
[Music]
all right
now the next step is to link these
routes to a button
in the nav bar that is the home and the
login button right so we're gonna make
use of the nav tag and an anchor tag for
this you can see that we have a nav tag
and an anchor tag
which encloses the login and the home
components
all right now we're going to make use of
two directors from the router package
called router link and router link
active now these are specified within
the anchor tag the router link basically
holds the path to the page
and the latter that is the router link
active specifies one or more CSS classes
that will be applied when the router
link is active
all right so to do that let me just add
router
link
all right in our case it is home here
and we're gonna have another director
called router link active
[Music]
and we're just gonna save active here
all right same for the login icon here
let me just copy this
[Music]
and instead of home
the path we created for this was login
[Music]
all right
so this is how you can bind the route to
your specific button on your UI now
despite of all this how are we
specifying where these components are to
be displayed
right the answer to this is using the
router Outlet director now again this
directive is available in the router
package so we have to add that in our
app component.html file
so here just go ahead and type
router Outlet
all right so with that we've created a
simple navigation bar which has
different options that is home about
services and Link and once the user
clicks on the home icon it displays the
content that is in the home
component.html file and once the user
clicks on the login component it
displays the content in the login.html
file
all right it's as simple as that so now
let's go to the browser and see if it
executes correctly
so all right we have the navigation bar
and once I click on the home icon here
all right yes we see that all the
content has been loaded
you can see we have uh the intro section
we have the courses section and the
footer section as discussed
and in today's video we'll be learning
all about react.js so let's jump in and
see what's in store for us so we'll be
covering topics on what is react why
react features of react react
prerequisites and its industry Trends
let's go ahead and begin with what is
react react is a JavaScript library used
to build fast and interactive user
interfaces for both web and mobile
applications now one thing that makes
react extremely powerful is the fact
that it's open source any user can
access its source code modify it and
enhance it in a typical model view
controller architecture react defines
the view part of the application there
is also responsible for how the app
looks and feels fun fact react was built
by Jordan walkie an engineer at Facebook
now let's go ahead and see how react
Works in real time consider a typical
web application say Instagram the entire
UI of the web page is divided into
several components we have the search
component a profile description
component stories from component and a
postless component these components make
the code easier to debug and always
remain discrete components also make
development and maintenance of web
applications faster as multiple
developers can work simultaneously on
different components of the same web
application now let's see why react is
so popular these days the ACT helps in
creation of dynamic web applications it
also provides performance enhancements
now there are several performance
enhancements like virtual Dom and
one-way data binding we'll learn about
these topics a little later in the video
react uses reusable components now this
helps decrease the development time
react involves unidirectional flow of
data react also has a small learning
curve compared to other Frameworks like
angular react is much easier to learn
react can also be used for mobile
applications react recently released an
extension called react native that is
used for developing mobile applications
that are cross-compatible it also has
dedicated tools for easy debugging now
let's dive in to the features of react
first let's understand jsx jsx is a
syntax extension to JavaScript using jsx
we can add HTML to the Javascript file
all coding in react is done using jsx it
also helps in making the code easier to
understand and debug ultimately jsx is a
combination of JavaScript and HTML now
let's consider a small example cons
simple here is a JavaScript notation H1
tags indicate HTML again the semicolon
indicates JavaScript note that the
semicolon is not mandatory however it's
a good practice to include it moving on
the next feature is virtual dom dom dom
which is an acronym for data object
model actually defines how documents are
accessed and manipulated in a web page
it represents the entire structure of
the web page in the form of a tree
now let's see how this actually works
react creates a virtual Dom that is the
exact copy of the real Dom traditionally
whenever something changes in the web
application all objects in the real Dom
are updated this makes it extremely slow
let's see how react counters this now
consider two objects whose states have
been changed react now compares the
virtual Dom with the virtual Dom
snapshot that was taken right before the
update by comparing the new virtual Dom
with the pre-update version react
figures out exactly which virtual Dom
objects have changed now react only
updates those objects on the virtual Dom
this makes a big difference when it
comes to speed coming to the next
feature performance react uses virtual
Dom as discussed earlier virtual Dom
impacts the speed of the web
applications we also took an example of
Instagram and learned how multiple
components can affect the development
time they help improve performance
drastically the next feature is one-way
data binding this means information
Flows In Only One Direction One Way data
binding is specifically used when
information is displayed and not updated
remember that the components of react
are functional in nature that is they
receive information through arguments
and pass information via their return
values the next important feature is
extensions react has many extensions
that we can use to create full-fledged
front-end applications it provides
server-side rendering which means that
the application is rendered on the
server rather than in the browser react
native which is a react extension is
used for developing mobile applications
there are many other extensions that
react provides for every scenario in web
development now let's look at a few of
them react native lets you build mobile
applications using only JavaScript a
react native app is a real mobile
application and not just a web
application running on your mobile
devices thousands of applications like
Facebook Instagram Pinterest Skype use
react native the next popular react
extension is flux flux is the
application architecture that Facebook
uses flux implements a unidirectional
flow which makes it easier to understand
what actually is going on now let's see
how it works when we trigger an action
the dispatcher will get notified the
dispatcher receives actions and
dispatches them to the stores a store is
what holds the data of an application
stores will register with the
applications dispatcher so that they can
receive actions data from stores is
displayed in views actions define the
internal API of your application they
capture how anything might interact with
your application the last feature of
react is debugging react applications
are easy to debug thanks to the large
and active developer Community you can
practically debug react calls within
your browser now notice the small react
extension icon at the top right corner
this developer tool allows the user to
inspect the code and also easily debug
it moving on let's learn about the
building blocks of react components
state weight and props are the essential
Concepts that one should know before
implementing react they are the
foundation on which react is built now
what exactly are react components
components are the building blocks of
any react application react divides the
user interface into multiple components
wherein each component defines how a
particular element is viewed in the
application react components remain
discrete and are processed independently
another feature is reusability
components can be reused multiple times
across the application this reduces the
development time consider the following
code snippet a component is implemented
as a JavaScript class having some State
and a render method state is the data
which we want the component to render
the render method is responsible for how
the UI looks and feels to the user the
next concept is state state of a
component is an object that holds some
data this data influences the output of
a component every time the state of an
object changes the component is
re-rendered onto the screen now let's
see what props are props are short for
properties allow us to pass arguments or
data to components properties help make
confidence more Dynamic it is important
to Define all the properties their types
and their default value props are passed
to components in a way similar to that
of HTML tag attributes now consider the
following code Snippets this shows
exactly how properties are passed to
components also detailed illustrations
on components props and state will be
shown in the upcoming videos so stay
tuned for that moving on let's go
through some of the things that you
should know before you can actually
start working on react you should be
familiar with programming Concepts like
functions objects arrays and classes one
should also have a basic knowledge of
JavaScript and a familiarity with HTML
don't worry if you feel like you're not
good at them once you start working on
them you'll get a good hang of it
finally let's go through the impact of
react on the I.T industry and get
insights into the salaries of react
developers statistics show that react
developers earn way more than other web
developers according to pay scale the
average salary for a react developer in
the United States is a whopping 91 000
US Dollars the average salary for a
react developer in India is 7.25 lakhs
per annum over the recent years react
has gained immense popularity and is
being adopted by many companies
according to the data by Google Trends
riyak has had a better growth scale
compared to other Frameworks like
angular and view statistics show that
front-end developers have wholeheartedly
adopted this lightweight framework
foregoing other available options if you
are skilled and have a knack for
front-end development react can help you
gain fantastic career opportunities
lastly talking about a few companies
that use react devotionally we have
Facebook Instagram Netflix Dropbox
WhatsApp among others in today's video
we'll be learning all about react
installation on windows so without
further Ado let's get started to set up
the react development environment we
need two things installed node and a
text editor of your choice so let's
begin by installing node.js we can head
to the official node.js website say
download
node.js so here you can see the windows
installer depending on your system you
can either download the 32-bit version
or the 64-bit version so I'm going to go
ahead and click on the 64-bit version
since it's already installed on my
system I'm not again installing node you
can follow the installation guidelines
and download it once you're done with
node installation you can go ahead and
download a text editor of your choice so
I'd suggest vs code so let's head to the
vs code page say download vs code click
on the first link and download the
64-bit version for Windows once you're
done with the installation of both node
and your text editor you can start
creating your first react application so
for that let's create a folder I am
creating it on my desktop while you can
create it in any of your drives let's
call it first react now open your
command prompt now you can type in the
path for the folder that you just
created so say CD
[Music]
first react now go ahead and type in the
command npm install
hyphen G create react app okay so this
command installs all the necessary
react.js modules now to check if the
version is correctly installed you can
type in create
react app version so you can see the
version here now let's continue and
develop your react application type in
the command create react app and you can
give a name to your application so I say
my app now this should take a couple of
minutes okay once you've successfully
created our application they say to
begin by typing the following commands
so let's do that save CD my app and npm
start this should typically start your
application and here we go all right you
can also open your application in the
text editor that you've downloaded so
let's go ahead and open vs code vs code
file open folder go to your desktop or
the drive that you've saved your folder
in first react my app and I say select
folder so as you can see all your
modules have been imported you can click
on app.js and start editing in today's
video we'll be learning all about the
most basic infrastructure of react.js
called components without delay let's
begin and look at what's in store for us
so we'll be touching on topics like what
are components types of components
nesting components higher order and pure
components and a brief description about
component life cycle all right to begin
with what exactly are components
components are the building blocks of a
react application wherein each component
represents a part of the user interface
now to make it more understandable
consider the Facebook home page the
entire UI can be broken down into
several elements say we have the
credentials component the sign up
component the image component and the
logo component notice that each
component adds something to how the home
page looks alright reusability is one of
the saline features of react components
one component can be reused several
times across the application and this
improves the development speed
components can also be nested one
component can internally consist of
several other components in its minimal
form a component must Define a render
method that specifies how exactly the
application looks and feels a component
can also receive properties from its
parent components also you'll get a
better understanding of all of these
when we start working Hands-On so don't
worry so moving on let's look at the
different types of components first we
have the stateless functional components
and then we have the stateful class
components now functional components are
typical JavaScript functions that return
HTML now they can be contained in a DOT
JS or a DOT jsx file coming to class
components these are regular ESX classes
however it's mandatory that they contain
a render method that in turn returns
HTML they can also be contained in dot
JX or a DOT jsx file okay then let's go
ahead and build our first react
application using components all right
so I've opened my text editor that is vs
code to build my application Also I
suggest you watch the react installation
on Windows video to help you get started
the video briefly explains how to
install node and how to start building
your first react application in my case
I've opened a folder called react
component tutorial and here in my source
folder I have app.js now app.js is the
main component that gets rendered to the
term let me show you that here in
index.js you pass app.js which is a
component that gets rendered to the
reactor so app.js consists of several
other components that can be nested so
as you can see app.js is a functional
component and before moving on let me
get rid of all the unnecessary code so
let me delete all of this
and return an H1 tag that says hello
welcome to Subway let me save it and if
you look at the browser you'll have
hello welcome to Centrelink now let's go
ahead and display another message say a
this
is not components right
leave it and let me check the browser it
gives you an error so jsx uses a
conventional rule which states that all
HTML tags have to be enclosed within a
div tag so for example I say div and I
enclose it so let me save and check my
browser again here you go so multiple
HTML tags have to be enclosed within the
div tag moving on let's create a first
functional component to do that I'll
first create a folder in my source
folder say components within that I'll
create a file say functional component
dot JS all right so the first thing we
have to do is import react so I say
import react from yeah the general
Syntax for a functional component
involves the keyword function and say
functional component now you say return
an H1 tag or I've already used H1 tags
so I'll say pair it off and I see it
this is a functional component
before explaining to you how these
components are exported and imported let
me show you the general Syntax for a
class component so I create another file
say class component dot JS I again
import react from react the general
notation is using the class keyword
followed by the name of the class
extending from the base class
react.component so going ahead I say
class class component extends react dot
component now the key feature of a class
component is the usage of a render
method so I say render within braces I
say return a paragraph tag saying this
is the class component
so moving on let's see how these
components can be nested into the main
component that is app.js components can
be nested into the main component using
Import and Export keywords so as the
name suggests export feature is used to
export a particular file or a module and
import is used to import a particular
file or a module into the current
existing module so we have two different
types of exports you have default export
and just export or named export so a
default export is used to export just
one object be it a function a class a
variable from the file and there can
only be one default export per file and
when you're importing it you can specify
the address and use the word import
before it so let me show you how it
works let's go back to our editor and
then functional component and here I say
export default and the name of the
functional component that is functional
com so let me save this and going back
to my app.js I say import name of the
functional component that is functional
com from and I pass the path this
components slash functional component
also let me get rid of these unnecessary
files here now let's define functional
component in our app.js component so
here I say functional comp let's compile
it and check our browser here it says
this is a functional component moving on
to my class component it's the same
syntax here as well let's say export
default name of my component and in my
app.js I import it import class comp
From the Path and again I'll have to
Define it in my return method I save so
let me compile it and check my browser
it says this is the class component one
unique feature of default export is that
I can rename the file while I'm
importing it so for example I can rename
it as say FC and while I'm defining it
I'll have to make sure I use the same
name and conventions so I say FC again
when I check it it says this is the
functional component there is literally
no difference the next type of export is
the named export or just export so a
named export can be used to export
multiple objects be it functions class
Etc from a file now there can be several
named exports from a single file one
hack is that while you're importing it
cannot be renamed so let me show you how
this works okay so let's create another
class in our class component so I'll
just copy paste this let me give it
another name say class comp 1 and the
mess message that I want to display is
hey I'm another class all right so when
I'm exporting it I don't want default so
let me take it off and say export here
all right in my app.js while importing
it I want to import both the classes so
I'll include them within curly braces
here I say class com comma class comp
one and then again I Define it here
class comp one let's compile it and run
it and here we go here you can see hey
I'm another class so we've successfully
exported both the classes from the class
component and imported it back in our
app.js component one advantage of using
named export is the fact that I can
choose to import the classes that I want
to now say for example I do not want to
import class component here so let me
take it off and here let me comment this
now let's compile and see hey I'm
another class the second class got
imported while the first class I was
defined earlier is not imported here
alright so next up we have higher order
and pure confidence now I won't get into
the nitty gritties of it because they're
Advanced topics but to give you a brief
Insight higher order components are
basically functions that take in a
component and return a new component the
whole ideology behind higher order
components is to facilitate the
reusability of component logic okay so
let's see how this works let's go back
to our code editor let's create a
component in our components folder let's
call the component
click dot JS all right so here we define
a class I use this snippet rce here we
go we get the entire format using the
small snippet rce and here I'm going to
make use of a button now see I use the
tag button and I'll say clicked one time
every time the user clicks on the button
the value gets incremented so for this
I'm going to use a variable say count
and I'm going to use the concept of
States so let's go ahead and Define our
variable count and initialize it to zero
so for that I'm going to use another
snippet called R const and here this dot
State equals my variable count
initializing it to 0. so let's define
the count variable in a render method so
I say const count equals this dot state
so every time we click on the button the
count value has to get incremented right
so we make use of an event called on
click equal is this dot update click Now
update click is going to be another
method that we have to Define now so
every time the button gets clicked this
method is called so let's go ahead and
Define the function so it is update
click equals is going to be an arrow
function and I say this dot set state is
nothing but count this Dot state DOT
count plus one okay and here we say
count times all right so once this is
done let's import our component in
app.js so here again I say import click
from components clip and let's define it
here so let's check our browser every
time we click on the button the value
gets incremented all right so let's go
ahead and create another component say
counter.js wherein every time the user
hovers the mouse on the button the count
value increases so let's go ahead and do
that I say
counter dot JS I'm again going to use
the snippet rce to create a class
component and here in my div tag I
Define a button and say incremented 2
for now I say x so now let's go ahead
and add the event save button on Mouse
enter I'm going to call the method this
dot increment count okay so once you're
done with that let's go ahead and Define
the increment count method I'm going to
copy the same code that I've mentioned
in my click.js so I say copy this all
right so one change is that I'll change
the name of the method and call it
increment count again let's define the
count in our render method so I say
const count equals this Dot
and here I change X to
now let's go ahead and import it in our
app.js so I say import counter from
components and counter and let's define
it here all right let's save it and
let's run the code okay so as you can
see you see another button here
incremented to 0 and every time I move
my cursor on the button it increments
mind you I'm not clicking I'm just
hovering my mouse okay to learn how
higher order components work we'll have
to pass counter.js and click.js as
parameters to give birth to an entire
new component so for that let's go ahead
and create another component for our SOC
let's call it higher order dot JS okay
so I say import react from react after
that I say const updated component
equals original component that's going
to be an arrow function again and within
curly braces I Define my class that is
class say new component extends react
dot component inside let's define find a
render method that Returns the original
component with a modification that is I
want to type the user I want to append
the user before the actual message is
displayed all right so let's go ahead
and close the tag and return new
component and let's export this say
export default updated component now we
import higher order.js in our counter.js
and click.js and pass these components
as parameters so let's do that let's go
to our counter.js and here I say import
updated component from dot slash higher
order component and here while exporting
I say updated comp and pass this as my
parameter let's do the same to click.js
here I import data.com from higher order
component and here I pass this as a
parameter now here in a higher order
component we've defined a property name
and initialized it to the user so we'll
have to include this in our other
components that's counter and click so
let's do that and here right before
incremented 2 I say this dot props dot
knee let me save it let me do the same
thing here and save this dot props dot
name so if you go back to our browser
here you can see it says the user
clicked zero times and the user
incremented to zero okay so this
basically shows how react Implements
reusability of components moving on our
next topic is pure complex evidence now
another way to create class component is
by extending pure component from react a
pure component avoids unnecessary
re-renders now how does it do it it does
not implement the should component
update method now you'll learn about
this method a little later in the video
now this method enables re-rendering of
components to the Dom but a pure
component on the other hand ensures a
shallow comparison of states and props
and checks if a re-render is actually
necessary only then does it render to
the Dom a react component can be
considered pure if it renders the same
output for the same state and props so
let's take an example to explain pure
components so let's go back to our vs
code and create two component classes
one for a regular component and the
other for a pure component I am using
this example I'll show you exactly how
pure component is more helpful okay so
let's create a pure component.js file I
say PR com
dot JS so here I'm going to use a
snippet rpce that is going to create a
pure component class let me get rid of
this export and here in my div tag I'll
display the text say I am the pure
component all right now let's go ahead
and create a regular component I may
call it regular component.js and here
I'm going to use the snippet rce and the
message that I want to display is I'm
the regular component so to draw a
comparison between the regular component
and the pure component let's create a
parent component for the two so let me
create one here I'll call it parent
component.js and this is again going to
be a regular class component and here I
display the message I am the parent
component to change the state of the
component we're going to make use of a
Constructor so let's use the snippet or
const and here let me create
name you can give anything and I say
simply learn now we make use of the
component did Mount lifecycle method to
set a time interval now don't worry
about this we're going to learn about it
a little later in the video so moving
ahead I'm going to make use of the
method and same component did Mount and
here I say set interval the first
argument is going to be an arrow
function and the second will be the time
interval and I'm going to be setting it
to 3 seconds now within the arrow
function I'll make use of the set State
function to set the state of my property
however I do not change the name I keep
it simply on itself moving on let's
import your component and the regular
component into our parent component and
then pass name as a property so to do
that first import pure com from your
component and then I say import regular
com from regular com.js and here let's
say regular com name equals this dot
state DOT name and I say pure component
name equals this dot state DOT me now
let's include the property name in both
our regular and pure components so to do
that let's just save this dot drop dot
name and here I again say this dot prop
dot name and finally let's import parent
component into our app.js component so
here I say import parent come from okay
and here let me Define parent.com
so now if you look at the browser we
have I'm the parent I am regular
component simply learn and I'm the pure
company we've got the result as expected
now to check if the pure content is
actually re-rendering or not let's
include simple console.log statements so
here I say CLG snippet and here I say
pure component render and in my regular
component I do the same thing I say
console.log regular component
render now let's do the same in our
parent component as well
I'd say parent
component render all right so let's go
back to our browser and inspect it in
our console first the parent component
gets rendered then the regular component
and then the pure component after that
for every three seconds only the pairing
component and the regular component is
rendered for the same state and prop the
pure component is not re-rendered so in
conclusion pure components optimize
react codes and also improves
performance so coming to the last topic
component life cycle so basically
combine life cycle explains the stages
the component goes through the entire
life cycle of a component can be divided
into three parts we have mounting
uptation and unmounting so the first
thing that gets invoked in the life
cycle is component will mount it is
invoked right before the initial
rendering occurs then we have the
rendering method now once a component is
inserted into the Dom component did
Mount gets involved coming to the next
phase we have updation when a complaint
receives props component will receive
props gets invoked set state is called
when the state of the property changes
so every time there is a change react
decides whether the next component State
Should trigger a re-render or not to do
that should component update method is
called component will update is invoked
right before re-rendering after
re-rendering component did update is
called that makes updates to the Dom and
the last phase is unmounted components
will unmount method does all the
necessary cleanup and erases all the
allocated memory and Cycles
in our previous video we learned about
react.js components in detail and now
moving ahead let's learn about another
striking feature of react.js called
props props short for properties allow
the user to pass arguments or data to
components a pairing component can pass
additional information to its children
using props properties help make
components more Dynamic props are passed
to competence in the ways similar to
that of HTML track attributes now we'll
look at this a little later in the video
props in a component are read only and
cannot be changed one thing to remember
is that props are sent by the parent to
the children components hence the
children components cannot make any
changes to these props now that we've
learned about props in brief let's go
ahead and create our application using
props if you're new to this tutorial I
suggest you go to the react installation
and react competence video on our
channel so back in my code editor that
is vs code I've opened a folder called
react props and now I'm going to create
a component a class component and I'll
call it class
props.js so let's create the class
component I give rce the snippet and
here I display a message saying an H1
tag basically
[Music]
all right
now let me get rid of export here and
import it in my app.js main component
here I say import
class props
all right now we Define the class
component in our render method
[Music]
all right
now if we go back to the browser you see
Hello Learners welcome to Simply
learning now let's say we want to
individually welcome every student
instead of retyping the message for
everybody we can pass their names as
props now let's see how to do that now
we pass the name as a property from the
main component that is apt.js to the
child component and render this onto the
browser so let's do that so here while
I'm defining my child component I say
name
I save it and here in my child component
instead of learners
I say I use the keyword this
dot crops dot name
let me save it and if you look at the
browser will have hello learner1 welcome
to Simply learn now let's go ahead and
welcome learner 2 and learner 3 so I
again say class props name equals
learner 2.
all right so if we save and look at the
browser we'll have all the three
Learners displayed on the browser we can
also pass multiple props to the child
component now say for example we want to
welcome the student from a particular
place so we say welcome learner1 from
Place X so I can hear Define another
property save place
[Music]
say please
similarly I can do it for the rest too
Place y
now let's go back to our class props.js
component and here say hello learner one
from this dot props dot place
let me save it and if you look at the
browser now we have hello learner1 from
Place X Place Y and play Z we can also
display whatever we want between the
opening and closing tags when invoking a
component now this is facilitated using
props.children reserved keyword now let
me explain to you how it's done with an
example here let's split the self and
closing tag into an opening and a
closing tag and in between them let me
display a message within the paragraph
tag let me say
and in my child component after my H1
tag
let me use a paragraph tag and here
let's use the reserved keyword this dot
props top children
so let's save it
and now if you look at the browser you
can here see the message displayed child
component so prop stop children can be
used when components do not know about
their children ahead of time this is
commonly seen in components like sidebar
and dialog that represent generic boxes
so let's go ahead and create a button
tag and check again
so here I'll split it and add a button
tag
and say click
and let's check our browser
here we go we get the output as expected
all right we saw the usage of props for
class components similarly we can use it
for functional components so let's go
ahead and create a functional component
let me call it
I say import react from
react
and then I say function
function props
and here I return an H3 tag
I'll say this is functional component
and I'll return another H3 tag saying
hello learner
so let me save this
and let's export it export default
function props
[Music]
and import it in our app.js again import
function problem
[Music]
function problem
and here in our render method let's
define it
let me call function prop
name
let me give learner 4.
and
place
say a
let me close it and back in our
functional component instead of learner
I save
prompts dot name
let me save it now if you look at our
browser it gives us an error it says
props is not defined so let's go back to
our code editor and pass props here
to a functional component also let me
Define hello frop start name
from
props dot place
let me enclose it within the div tag
here
[Music]
let me save it and now if you look at a
browser here we go we get the output as
expected
so let's begin and learn what exactly is
a state in react typically a state is an
object that stores the values of
properties belonging to a component now
these values can change over a period of
time either via user interactions or
network changes and the state helps
facilitate this functionality every time
the state changes react re-renders the
component to the browser the state is
initialized in the Constructor a state
can also store multiple properties a
method called set state is used to
update the value of the state object now
this function performs a shallow merge
on the new and the previous state
conventionally a shallow merge ensures
that the previous state values are
overwritten by the new state values
moving on in our previous video we
learned about props and although props
and state dictate and control the
behavior of a component they have
significant differences so let's go
ahead and draw a comparison between the
two firstly props in a component are
used to pass data and event handlers to
its children while State on the other
hand is used to store the data that has
to be rendered on the web page props are
immutable once said by the parent they
cannot be changed State holds volatile
data and can be changed over time props
can be used in functional and class
components while state is restricted to
class components props are set by the
parent component while a state is
generally updated by event handlers now
that we've learned all about State let's
go ahead and build an application to see
the working of State alright so in my
code editor that is vs code I've created
my application say State and here in my
source folder I have my app.js file now
here I'm going to get rid of all the
unnecessary code that I'm not going to
be using Also I suggest you go through
the react installation on Windows video
to help you get started with creating
your first application so let's create
our class component say class app
extends react dot component inside I
have a random method that returns an
HTML tag let's display a message welcome
let's follow the jsx conventions and
enclose all the HTML tags within the div
tag so I say div
class name equals app we also have to
import the app.css file import
app.css and so we save it and if you
look at the browser we have welcome now
let's beautify our code to do that let's
add some styling so here in my app.js
class component I say Styles equals
and I say font style and I set it to say
bold and I said color say teal and here
in my H1 tag I say style equals this dot
Styles so let me save it and if you look
at the browser now we have welcome in
teal and it's bold now let's go ahead
and create a class component to
understand state so first I create a
folder and I call it components and
inside this folder I create a class
component and I call it newcomp dot JS
and I use the snippet rce to create the
class component to give you an insight
into what we're doing today we'll
display a message asking the user to
subscribe to Simply learn once the user
clicks on the Subscribe button we
instruct them to click on the Bell icon
and finally we display a thank you
message now to do all of this we're
going to make use of state and as
mentioned earlier we initialize the
state of object in a Constructor so
let's use the snippet R const to create
a Constructor now in the state object we
initialize a property let's call it
message and we display a message saying
subscribe to Simply learn that's save it
and here in our render method let's say
class name equals app and let's create
an H3 tag and within the tag I'll
display the message so I save this dot
state DOT message let's save it and now
let's import it in our app.js component
so I'll get rid of export here and here
I say
import new com from components and
newcom and let's define it here and say
new so we save it and look at the
browser it says subscribe to Simply
learn all right again to make our code
look more presentable let's add in
Styles so I'll just copy the same styles
that I've added here and I'll paste them
here and instead of bold I make it
italic and I change the color to say
purple and again in my H3 tag I Define
style and initialize it with this dot
Styles so let me save it and now if you
look at the browser it's in italic and
it's in purple
okay so moving ahead let's create a
button that reads subscribe and once the
user clicks on it the button should read
subscribed and the message displayed
above should instruct the user to click
on the Bell icon to do that let's first
create a button the message that I want
the button to read is subscribe however
this message gets changed once the user
clicks on the button so instead of
explicitly mentioning subscribe here I
create a prop I say sub and I say
subscribe here and back in my render
method I'll say this dot state DOT sub
so let's save it and if you look at the
browser now you have a button which
displays a message subscribe now once
the user clicks on the button the
message displayed should change to click
on the Bell icon to never miss an update
so let's create an event handler for
that so here button on click I call
another method and let's call the method
button change okay so this method should
update the state and change the message
and sub values to do that we make use of
a set State method now our state can be
updated in response to event handlers
server responses or prop changes now all
the updation can be done using the set
State method now this is the general
syntax used by the method we'll however
look at this further in the demo now the
set State method conventionally enques
all the updates made to the component
State and instructs react to re-render
the component and its children with the
updated State now let's go back to our
code editor and look at the working of
this method now here I Define the arrow
function button change if you are not
familiar with arrow functions I suggest
you read up on them and this is the
general syntax and here I say this dot
set State and inside I change my message
to hit the Bell icon to never miss an
update and myself up value changes to
subscribed let's save this and now if
you look at the browser when we click on
the Subscribe button the message changes
to hit the Bell icon to never miss an
update so moving ahead let's use a Bell
icon so that the user can click on it
once he clicks on the image the image
changes and a thank you message appears
on the screen so for that I have two
images I have Bell a and Bell V so I
drag and drop both the images in my
components folder alright now let's
import these images into our new com.js
file here I say import Bell a from Bell
a DOT PNG and again I say import Bell B
from Bell B dot PNG all right let me
save it to display the image on the
screen we make use of the image tag now
this tag has two attributes one is the
source attribute that specifies the URL
and the other is the alt attribute that
specifies an alternate text for the
image so here in my component I say I
make use of a paragraph tag that will
help display the image in the next line
and then I use the image tag now since
my image changes once it's clicked I
have to define a property and pass the
event handler click that will update the
image so here before specifying The
Source let's go back to our state and
Define another
property that is image URL and let's set
it to Bell a since that is the image
that I want to display first let me save
it and here in my image tag I say Source
equals this dot state DOT image URL and
then we have the alt tag and I do not
want to display any message so I leave
it as it is now let's save it and if we
look at the browser we have a bell
displayed however now let's change the
dimensions of the bell I do not want
such a huge bell so back in my vs code I
Define style with width say 30 pixels
and a height with again 30 pixels let me
save this and now if you look at the
browser we have a smaller icon so once
the user clicks on this image the image
changes and the message displayed here
gets updated to do that we'll have to
Define an event so let's go back to our
vs code and here in my image tag let's
say on click and Define a method say
this dot image change and now we Define
this method here as the image change I
make use of a narrow function again and
again I use the set State method I
update the image so I say image URL is
now set to Bell B and the message is
updated to thank you happy learning
so let's save this now and if we look at
the browser we see the image and once
clicked on it the image gets updated and
the message changes so finally Let me
refresh the browser once and show the
full execution Let me refresh following
the instructions let's click on the
Subscribe button and now it says hit the
Bell icon and once I do that the image
updates and the message changes
so what exactly is node.js now consider
a scenario where a user interacts with a
web application the user only interacts
with the front end of the application
but there's a lot of work that goes
behind the scenes now in a web
application there's a front end a server
and a database the front end is
developed using JavaScript and
Frameworks like angular and react while
the server is built on Java PHP or
node.js and the backend database that
stores the data usually consists of
MySQL or mongodb so node.js is an open
source cross-platform JavaScript runtime
environment for running server-side
applications it is used to develop i o
intensive web applications like video
streaming sites single page applications
online chatting applications and other
web applications it is used by large
established companies and newly minted
startups node.js was developed by Ryan
Dahl in 2009 and at the same time of
this session its latest version is
v13.3.0 now that we know what node.js is
let's go ahead and look at why it was so
prevalent in the field of web
development here are a few points first
up node.js is extremely fast being built
on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
its library is extremely fast in code
execution node package manager has
around 50 000 bundles for developers so
whatever functionality is required for
an application can be easily imported
from npm all apis of node.js Library are
asynchronous that is non-blocking it
means a node.js based server never waits
for an API to return data node.js
dramatically reduces the processing time
while uploading video and audio files it
is also an open source platform and is
easy for beginners for web development
the above reasons more than justify the
popularity of node.js platform and why
it is being adopted by a large number of
organizations and businesses today so
now moving on let's familiarize
ourselves with the parts of node.js
node.js consists of several components
now let's look at them one by one first
up we have modules now modules are like
JavaScript libraries which are used in a
node.js application to include a set of
functions now we can use required
function with the parenthesis to include
a module in a node.js application
node.js application has many modules to
provide basic functionality needed for a
web application some of them could be
HTTP util FS URL query string stream and
zlip next up we have console the console
module provides a simple debugging
console that is similar to the
JavaScript console mechanism provided by
web browsers now the console can print
messages to STD out that print standard
output messages and SCD air to print the
error messages the next component is
cluster now node.js is built upon the
concept of single threading programming
a single instance of node.js runs in a
single thread to take advantage of
multi-core systems the user will
sometimes want to launch a cluster of
node.js processes to handle the load a
cluster can be added to an application
in this way here is a small code for you
the next component is global now global
objects in node.js are available in all
modules now these objects are functions
modules strings Etc some node.js Global
objects are mentioned in the table you
have dir name that is a directory name
file name exports module and require the
next component is error handling now
node.js applications experience four
types of Errors we have the standard
JavaScript errors system errors user
specific errors and assertion errors now
errors in node.js are handled through
exceptions now for example let's handle
an error that would occur when we divide
a number by zero now this error would
crash the node.js application and so we
should handle this error here's a small
code for you next up we have streaming a
stream is an abstract interface for
working with streaming data in node.js
streams are objects that let you read
data or write data continuously there
are four types of streams first one is a
readable these are the types of streams
from which data can be read writeable
these are the types of streams to which
data can be written duplex these are
both readable and writable streams
lastly we have transformed these streams
can manipulate the data while it is
being read or written moving on to the
next component buffer the JavaScript
language has no mechanism for reading or
manipulating streams of binary data
buffer is a module that allows handling
streams that contain only binary data an
empty buffer of length 10 can be created
by this method next up we have domain
domains provide a way to handle
different i o operations as a single
group domain module intercepts errors
that remain unhandled there are two
types of methods that are used for
intercepting these errors firstly we
have enter internal binding in this case
the error emitter executes its code
inside the arrow method next up is the
external binding now here the error
emitter is explicitly added to a domain
via its add method the next component is
the DNS the DNS module enables name
resolution for example it is used to
look up the IP addresses of host names
DNS module is used to connect to a DNS
server and perform neem resolution by
using the method dns.resolve the DNS
module is also used for performing name
resolution without a network
communication by using the method
dns.lookup the next component is a
debugger node.js includes an out of
process debugging utility accessible via
a V8 inspector and built-in debugging
client this node.js debugger is not
feature packed but supports simple
inspection of code it can be used in the
terminal by using the inspect keyword
before the name of the Javascript file
in order to inspect a file say
myscript.js you can use the following
method now that we are familiar with all
the major parts of node.js let's go
ahead and learn about the node.js
Express framework Express is a flexible
node.js web application framework that
provides a wide set of features to
develop both web and mobile applications
you can assume Express as a layer built
on top of the node.js that helps manage
the server and the routes now let's have
a quick look at some of the core
features of Express framework it is used
to design single page multi-page and
hybrid web applications it allows
setting up of middleware to respond to
http requests it defines a routing table
that is used to perform different
actions based on the HTTP method and URL
it also allows Dynamic rendering of HTML
Pages based on passing arguments to
templates now moving on let's take a
quick example of a simple hello world
program now this is developed using
Express framework to gain a better
understanding alright first up we have
the WHERE Express now this is used to
import Express framework into our
node.js application now the app.get
method is a callback function with
parameters request and response the
request object represents the HTTP
request and has properties for the
request query string parameters body
HTTP headers Etc the response object
represents the HTTP response that an
Express app sends when it gets an HTTP
request now the application will listen
to the defined Port which in this case
is 8081 and variables host and Port will
contain the address and the port
respectively lastly we have the
console.log which is used to show the
address and port in the command prompt
so this is what the command prompt would
look like and finally the output is
displayed on the web browser Having
learned about the Express framework now
let's move on and look at the node.js
use cases now it is no doubt that node
stands out for its speed and intensive
data exchange so top industry leaders
like NASA PayPal Netflix among others
incorporate node.js first up we have
Netflix the world's leading internet
television network with over 117 million
users is one of the top companies that
trusted their server services to node.js
the reasons why the company chose to use
node.js for application scalability and
data intensive application now you must
be wondering what application
scalability is with basically the
potential of an application to grow in
time being able to efficiently handle
more and more requests per minute and
data intensive application allows
millions of people to stream Netflix
simultaneously next up is Walmart now
Walmart is the world's largest company
by Revenue with around 514 billion US
Dollars according to the fortune Global
500 list in 2019. again the reasons why
the company chose node.js were
asynchronous IO and efficient handling
of concurrent requests now asynchronous
IO which is a form of input output
processing allows other processing to
continue before the transmission has
finished node.js is able to efficiently
handle concurrent requests with the use
of thread pool and event cues Uber Uber
is an American multinational ride
hailing company offering services that
include peer-to-peer ride sharing right
service healing and food delivery the
reasons why the company chose node.js
were asynchronous i o quick iterations
and active open source Community as
mentioned earlier asynchronous IO
permits other processing to continue
before the transmission has finished now
quick iterations now node.js is
continually being updated and added new
features that help in further
Improvement in the performance of web
servers and finally active open source
Community resolves many problems that an
organization May face in a particular
scenario next up we have NASA now NASA
as an independent agency of the United
States federal government responsible
for the civilian space program as well
as Aeronautics and Aerospace research
the reasons why the company chose
node.js were reduced access times
handling of data intensive tasks and the
fact that the servers are active 24 7.
now NASA has lots and lots of data and
using node.js has really helped them in
reducing the access times it is also
continuously handling and working with
large streams of data node.js is highly
stable which helps in keeping the server
active 24 7. next up we have PayPal now
PayPal is an American company operating
a worldwide online payment system that
supports online money transfers as
opposed to traditional methods like
checks and money orders the reasons why
the company chose to use node.js were
the fact that node.js has extremely fast
build times it allows tasks to be
carried out with fewer lines of code
when compared to other server
Technologies like Java and PHP and
node.js being data intensive efficiently
handles a large amount of data next up
is medium medium is a popular online
publishing platform developed by Evan
Williams and launched in August 2012.
the main reasons why the company chose
to use node.js were a data driven
applications now these applications are
ideal for being interfaced with node.js
servers B to run a b tests now A B
testing is essentially an experiment
where two or more variants of a page are
shown to users at random and statistical
analysis is used to determine which
variation performs better lastly node.js
server maintenance is simpler than its
counterparts moving on to the last topic
of this session industry Trends now
node.js developers are in demand across
the globe since many companies are
adopting JavaScript libraries according
to Forbes it is one of the top 10 most
in-demand jobs according to node Source
the total number of node.js downloads
increase by 40 in the last one year the
use of node.js in production has
increased dramatically since its release
in 2010. with early adopters such as
LinkedIn PayPal and Netflix among others
node.js has seen an exponential increase
in its use in web development the
popularity of node.js is also accounted
to JavaScript now since JavaScript is
the most popular language as evident
from a survey conducted by stack
Overflow in 2019 many developers can
start working on node.js library with
not much of a learning curve node.js
developers are being offered better
salary options than another web
technology developers according to pay
scale the average salary of a node.js
developer in India is around 6 lakhs 13
000 rupees per year the average salary
of a node.js developer across the United
States is around 105 000 US dollars per
year in this video we'll help you
install node.js on your Windows system
so without further Ado let's begin the
first thing you need to do is download
node.js from their official website so
go ahead and type download node.js
navigate to their official website and
here
you can see the 64-bit version so go
ahead and download that once the
download is done go ahead and run the
downloaded node.js installer
accept the license agreement keep the
default settings as it is
and then say install
so with that we finish the installation
process
once node has been successfully
installed the next crucial step is
verification now this process ensures
that node has been properly installed to
do so we first open the command prompt
and then type in a few commands to
verify the successful installation we
type in this command
node hyphen V now this command Returns
the version and if it Returns the
version it means it has been
successfully installed
so here we go it Returns the latest
version
now the final step is to update the node
package manager now this npm is bundled
with node.js which consists of all the
repositories and packages required for
development purposes so to do that type
in the command npm
install npm
hyphen hyphen Global now that we're done
with the installation of node let's go
ahead and Implement a small program for
that we make use of a text editor in our
case we've installed vs code so go ahead
and download vs code once you're done
with the installation this is what vs
code looks like so go ahead and click on
file and create a new file it's going to
be a simple program where you're going
to print a hello world message on the
web browser to do that we make use of
HTTP modules so node comes with built-in
HTTP modules to transfer data across it
so for that we make use of a require
method we create a variable first say
where
HTTP equals required and just say HTTP
within single quotes
now the HTTP module can create an HTTP
server that listens to the server ports
and gives a response back to the client
to do that we make use of the create
server method so let's go ahead and type
the code
say http
dot create
server and internally it consists of a
function
now the parameters to this function are
request and response now the response is
basically used to write to the client so
we say response dot write and here we
type in the message say hello world
welcome
to this tutorial
once you're done with that you end the
response
so the server listens to a port number
to display the message by default it
listens to the port number 8080 so we
keep that as it is and we end it save
your file
say demo.js maybe demo1.js and zc now to
run the program you have to open the
command prompt so open your command
prompt
and mention the path to your file so in
our case it's our desktop saved on the
desktop so CD
desktop and now to run it say node
demo one dot JS now we navigate to your
browser
and say localhost 8080 and here we go
our message is successfully displayed so
let's talk about the node.js
architecture and understand why it's so
good
so to begin with uh node.js has what's
called a single threaded event Loop
architecture and this allows you to be
able to handle many many concurrent
clients at the same time it's just a
very flexible way of being able to scale
up your support for many clients
and then in addition to that we have the
JavaScript event based model along with
the JavaScript callback mechanism that
allows you to have this standard
approach to being able to connect with
and talk and discuss interactions
between the client and the server
it's good to have these kind of
Standards where you're not using
something that's unique to a specific
framework or specific technology and
this just makes it so it's a more
accessible for everybody
so if we look at the actual node.js
server itself everything centers around
the the concept of the event Loop and
the event Loop has a a an event queue an
operation completed um fire request
threaded pull and then it'll actually do
the actual computation or the file
system interaction
all of this interconnects in a nice
seamless Loop the great thing again with
node.js is that it's not new technology
it's been around for almost a decade
it's very very well tried out many of
the largest websites out there are runny
node.js
so let's now dig into each of the parts
of the node.js architecture so let's
talk about requests
so the way that the request works is
that you have your framework such as
angular on the client and that will then
send a request to the web server there's
many ways that those requests can happen
through web workers through forms and
through other interactions but at some
point a request is sent to the server
and so these requests can be for data
they can be for deleting data they can
be for updating data they can be for
interacting with Services as mentioned
before but the goal is to have some kind
of request now once that request
actually hits the server and then we
start actually getting into the queuing
and threading process that centers
around the event Loop and this is where
node.js really excels because it's able
to use that single threaded model to be
able to manage from just even a few
requests to tens of millions of requests
so it receives the actual request and
starts the event queue and this is where
a single threading process starts is by
queuing everything up appropriately
and then it then maintains the thread
within a pool so you have the queuing
process as one action and then you have
a threaded pull which manages those
threads as well
and then we have an event Loop which you
know goes through as you receives and
processes those requests
and then finally what we're doing is
we're actually then going to be
interacting with a system and that could
be a database it could be a cloud system
it could be an API file system but we're
interacting with something that's
outside of the node.js server so the
node.js server itself is doing some
actions on the server but then it's also
interact with things outside of its own
server environment
and so this talk a little bit about that
workflow so requests come in they go
into the event queue and they get
spiraled through the event Loop and then
we have a non-blocking operators which
are going to be doing the input output
polling such as KQ e-poll and other
services and from there we're also going
to be then interacting with a threaded
pool and we're using the blocking
operations to manage that threaded pull
and that threaded pool is going to now
then go outside of the server and
interact with something beyond the
server so whether that is a database or
file system or API or microservice these
are things that can be interacted with
so let's go through what npm is so npm
itself stands for the node package
manager
no great shakes there as the name says
it's responsible for all the packages
and modules that are bundled Within
node.js
so the notification itself really has
two key functionalities now the first is
that reply it is a central repository
for all packages and modules which you
can then search through um online you
can go to
search.nodejs.org and you can find all
of the packages of modules that are out
there now the second is that it's also a
command line or terminal uh line utility
that allows you to install those
packages so you can actually go through
and you can see the version management
and dependencies that within those
packages and you actually can control
the packages themselves
so why would you use npm
so npm is really useful for being able
to extend the project you're working on
so when you're building out a project
one of the concepts I like to use is the
concept of Lego bricks
um big fan of Lego and uh what's great
about Lego bricks is that they're all
individually by themselves very small
very specific functionality but if you
actually get a whole collection of Lego
bricks together you can build like crazy
cool things so think of when you're
working with the node package manager
itself is that each of those individual
pieces that you're working with each of
those individual packages are their own
Lego bricks and by themselves you can
then edit and update and maintain that
piece certainly from the whole
environment as long as your inputs and
outputs you know really the piece where
you snap the Lego in or when you connect
the Lego to something else are
interacted and open and well documented
then you can actually then use those
modules effectively throughout your
project
um so you can actually then be able to
do that you can do Version Control on
your codes and dependencies you can do
testing very easily
and then once you actually get to the
point where you go yes I want to release
um a new module you can do that
effectively using npm and it will
actually go through and do the actual
deployment for you
so let's go through the npm installation
so the actual package manager itself is
included with the installation of
node.js so if you've installed and
you're running node.js locally then
you've already installed the package
manager but you can also access it
through command line or terminal window
on your data server or in your server or
in via the cloud
if you haven't now downloaded node.js
here's the website where you can go down
to install it and there's Windows and
Mac versions of that code as well with
the installers which allow you to get up
and going very quickly
you want to be able to run the installer
and accept all the default settings just
to you know to begin with you want to
kind of have the standard setup so that
you are most familiar with the normal
settings before you start getting to the
point where you're a master and you're
tweaking things
there is a way that you can open up the
command window or The Terminal window
and once you've actually installed
node.js to verify that it's actually
installed you can write the command node
dash dash version and they'll actually
then pull out the version of node.js
that you have installed and then you'll
be able to see that you've got it
actually up and running
and then you can also do the same thing
for npm where you can do npm dash dash
version and actually will then show you
which version of the node package
manager you have running so you can
actually take it full advantage of that
program and verify that it's actually up
and running now so we're actually going
to go ahead and actually run a demo of
using npm and to do that I've got three
windows in front of me right now so I
have this window here which is my
terminal window where I'll be doing all
of my instructions and then I also have
a folder which shows where I'll be
putting all of the files and then
finally I'll actually have a text editor
in this case I'm using vs code because
it's free but you can use any text edit
you like to be able to go in and show
what the code that has been created by
npm in the Json file so you can actually
see what it looks like and then we'll
modify it a little bit so first thing we
want to do is we want to go ahead and
create a new project file so I'm going
to go in I'm just going to move into
let's do
change directory I'm going to the
project folder and we'll see down here
that we have an empty project folder but
for this one I'm actually going to go
ahead and I'm going to create a new
directory in this one and I'm going to
call this one simply learn
and there we are we've created a new
simply available folder
and we are going to move into the
sympathy land folder
and so we're now in the simply lab
folder uh there's nothing in that right
now um so the first thing we want to do
is we want to take go ahead and
initialize this folder as a project
folder for working with npm now to do
this you will have to have already
installed npm if you have node.js npm
comes with it and if you want to see
whether or not you have npm installed so
you can just do npm
Dash version
and that will actually tell you what the
version of npm you have installed is it
also verifies that npm is installed so
I've gone ahead and I've been able to
validate that I have npm installed so
what I'm now going to go ahead and do is
I'm going to initialize this folder so
to do that just do npm in it and you'll
see that the path is that we're already
in the simply learn folder and then when
you do that
it's going to ask you some questions so
what is the package name we're going to
go with the defaults for right now and
then I can show you how we can edit
those in a little bit uh we're going to
go with just say yes to all of these
just by hitting return
and you'll see here that we're going to
create a new folder called a
package.json folder this is the
instructions that we have in the folder
do you want to go ahead and create this
we want to and it's going to go ahead
and do that and we can see now in our
folder here that we actually have
package.json so if we go ahead and open
this up with
vs code here we are we can actually see
what all the information is we can go
ahead and we can actually go and update
this metadata if we want to I'm going to
leave it as is for right now because I
want to show you a couple of other
things so a lot of times when you're
actually working with npm and the reason
why you're using npm is that you want to
take advantage of packages that are
freely available in the open source
community that are supported by node.js
and one of those is a package called
Express and express is a lightweight
framework for building out web
applications similar concept to angular
or react.js I like using it and it's
also a great way to be able to show how
we can install this using npm so to
install this you just start with the
command npm and then you type install
and then we type the name of the package
and we hit
enter and it goes ahead and what you'll
actually see
is a couple of things one is we have a
dependency in our package above we also
have so this is in our Json package that
it's now dependency it's written in
there we can also go in and under our
node modules we actually see that we
have if we scroll down we should see
Express
there it is Express
now if we decide that we don't want to
use um Express we can actually just come
in and we can write command npm
uninstall
type
Express
oops
did a typo there so let's try that again
npm
uninstall
Express
and couple things can happen one is in
our Json file the dependency for the
express file has now been removed
and we can also see that underarm node
modules there are no extensions there
so this is kind of cool this allows us
to be able to see
um that we can easily add and remove
packages so let's just go ahead and I'm
going to install Express account so
installed
Express
npm install Express
all right so it's gone ahead and it's
installed Express
now one of the things that often happen
is that when you're working with a
package the actual Json package so
you'll receive this file and you want to
be able to go ahead and install of the
sub modules that come with it so and you
can go through and you can manually
install them like this or you can
actually run an install command so you
can actually install all of them at once
I can just show you what that looks like
because we're going to actually go ahead
and simulate as if we're going to
install bootstrap
which is another
popular framework
and we're actually going to go with
and then we'll save that
and what we'll see is under the packages
that bootstrap isn't listed in there we
do have Express there it is right there
so we now come over to our new command
so we can actually write the command npm
install
and now
site typo let's try that again
let's do npm
install
okay it does help to save your file so
let's go ahead and let's run npm install
and when you do that what we'll now
actually have is not just
Express but we'll also see that
bootstrap has also been added
now I don't recommend that you use the
star symbol which will install the
latest version of bootstrap because you
obviously haven't tested your
application against that but it gives
you an idea of of what's happened here
now if we want to we can actually go in
here and we can see on in
install
bootstrap
and it will actually remove that from
your Json package so there we are that's
how you work with using npm from getting
started with a setup for a base
initialization of your package going
through to creating the first package
being able to set up and control the
naming convention for each of the items
within the metadata that provides the
instruction for the package how you then
put in dependencies such as Express and
bootstrap how you can install them and
remove them and actually use do all of
this through command line if you have
any questions please let us know
Jambo is a popular framework nowadays
and you must have heard it
almost every website and web
applications uses Django and somewhere
other further web development
so in today's session we'll discuss what
is Django framework
let's start by discussing what is a web
framework
a web framework is a software framework
that is created to support the
development of dynamic sites web
services and web applications
it supports creation development and
Publishing of the web applications and
websites hi guys I'm Anjali from Simply
learn now if you have been following our
playlist on python by now you have
probably completed all the basic
concepts of python so today we'll use
these basic concepts in creating a
website using python again now this
application is called Django and before
we move into actually developing the
website let's better understand what
Django is so Django is a high level
python web framework so when you compare
Django to many of its other counterparts
such as flask which also uses python it
provides very limited freedom but then
again this limited Freedom does mean
that it makes development much faster
and that is the goal of Django so if you
are a complete beginner with web
development and also start off with
python this is the place to start so
Django has a free and a paid version but
since you're just learning how it works
we can go for the free version in fact
the paid versions only required when
it's utilized by companies where they
perform a lot of modifications to the
point that it's actually unrecognizable
now some of the companies which are
using Django are Instagram bitbucket
Pinterest and even NASA now there's
another important thing that we need to
understand about Django which is its
design pattern so Django follows the MTV
design pattern where MTV stands for
model template view these terms may seem
very remote to you right now and I don't
think there'd be a point of me
explaining what they are as of now so
once we move on to the demo where I'll
be teaching how you can create the web
framework we can better understand how
this design pattern works and with that
we are finally ready to move into
actually creating our website so there
are certain prerequisites to Django to
perform these open your command prompt
so the first thing we need to ensure is
that your system has python installed
now of course if you are learning Django
you probably already know Python and for
this purpose you would have had python
installed previously itself will just
checked so type in Python version and if
you do have python installed your
version number will appear here now the
other thing we need installed is PIP so
once again pip would also be installed
on your systems it comes with python
itself and so yeah I have Pip
19.0.2 version now once those two things
are done we'll move on to a virtual
environment so a virtual environment is
basically this environment that we
create to isolate our application now
this is necessary in Django because
often we make applications we have
completely built the application and now
we do not want to touch them we do not
want to create anything new we do not
want to update any packages that are
already being used so if you're creating
a new application for which you need to
update the packages we don't want the
implementation of that to hamper with
the implementation of a current
application so this is why we completely
isolate them so for that the first thing
you do is you need to install the
virtual environment wrapper we'll use
the PIP command to
install virtual EnV wrapper so if you're
using any other systems such as Linux
systems and then press enter but in case
of Windows put a dash and win which
signifies windows so I already have my
virtual environment installed so now we
have python we have our pip and we have
the virtual environment now let's create
a virtual environment so to create the
virtual environment type in MK virtual
EnV and the name for your virtual
environment so previously I had made a
virtual environment py1 this time I'll
go with py2 and that should create your
environment so virtual environment is
created which is py2 and as soon as it's
created you'll notice that now your
commands start running in py2 so when
you're creating an application the
application itself is not created at
this place it's just the environment
files that's stored in here so now all
this is done the final prerequisite is
of course to have our web framework we
need to install Django so let let's get
to that we install Django so now that
Django is installed we are finally ready
to start our project so the command to
run to start your first project Django
Dash admin start project and followed by
the name of your project so I'll just
name my project the Django project so I
just cleared my screen now if you go to
this location where we created our
project you'll see the project folder is
created here and inside the folder
there's yet another folder with the same
project name and a manage file now this
manage file is usually what we will be
running to compile our programs and then
within the folder you have certain
python files so we'll open all this in
our ID and I'll be using pycharm but you
can go ahead with any other python ID in
fact you can even use a notebook so you
can select your project from here the
panel on the left or you can opt for
open browse through your folders and
then select your project so the project
we created just now is is the Django
project which is this one so I'll open
it and and your project will appear on
the left side panel here you can see
within it there's another folder with
the same project name and there's the
manage.py file now within this folder
again there's another folder dot idea
and then there is the init settings URL
and the wsgi file although we won't be
making changes or modifying any of these
files so we'll check out what these
files are one by one although we won't
be making modifications to most of them
the idea folder probably won't be
existing in your project you can
completely ignore that now we'll have a
look at what each of these python files
do so the first file which is the init
file as you can see it's empty the
reason is that the very presence of this
file is only to inform that this package
here this is not any ordinary folder
it's a python package so you don't
really need any content within this now
the next file that we have here is the
settings file so the settings file is
essential configuration file this is
modified only when your application goes
into the real world other than that we
just leave it as it is so some of the
values that you would be modifying is
for example the debug value now when the
debug value is true which in our case it
is whenever an error occurs in any of
your code and you're trying to run that
page all the errors appear on the page
but now if you are putting your website
into the real world you do not want that
all your errors will be displayed on the
page for obviously security reasons so
then you can just change this value to
false just before you upload your page
next you have the URLs page as from the
name it's very clear the URLs page is
where you have your url stored so
basically this file Maps the URL of a
page to the function that the page will
be performing so now you have the wsgi
dot py code file so this page contains
an application callable which the
application server uses to communicate
with your code and finally we have the
manage.py page this is the page used to
interact with your project so we never
ever touch the manage.py page the
settings page does change when your
website goes into the real world the
URLs page we will be actually modifying
during the course of our project again
the wsgy Dot py Page we leave it
untouched so now that you know the
basics of what each file already present
does we can start our demo so before we
start coding our website there's a dummy
development server which is provided
with Django so we'll just check that out
first just go to your command prompt and
move into the path of your project and
then you just type python
manage.py run server and as you can see
here the development server has started
and it's at Port 8000 so go to your
browser open any browser of your choice
localhost and at 8 000 port and as you
can T here since we have installed our
Django and we ran our server so our
Django page has appeared here and it
says that our installation worked
successful so so far all good we can now
start building our project so what
website are we creating well I was
thinking of a very basic website where
you'll have the front page the first
page would have probably like three four
genres and within each honor you'll have
a piece that is an article a novel or
even a poem of that particular genre so
the user gets to click the genre on the
first page and the minute he or she does
so we move on to the next page where we
have our article within that genre
displayed we'll also include a
registration page just to see how that
works with Django so before we move on
guys I want to tell you that this
tutorial will completely concentrate on
how Django worked so we will not look
much into the details of how our page is
displayed that is we won't go in depth
into HD ml CSS and so on but rather just
stick to Django and its functionality
and another thing that we need to know
about Django before we start developing
is that every page in Django is called
an app so when you go to a website say
Facebook for instance you have multiple
tabs right so there's a tab for the
profile you click on it and it
immediately takes you to your profile
now if this entire thing that is
Facebook was built on Django then your
profile would be one app and then
there's another tab which takes you to
your messages the page where all your
messages are displayed that would be a
second app so that's how Django works
every small thing every component or
every page of your website is an app and
you need to ensure that you can describe
exactly what an app does in one or two
sentences so a page should not have
multiple things happening on it if a
page is for displaying messages that
should be the sole purpose of the page
so yeah that's the basic of apps and how
they are a part of Django so how do we
create this app just open your command
prompt move on to the path where your
project is stored now in here you'll
type in the command to create your first
app so that's python manage dot py start
app and then the name for your app so
I'll name my app genre so basically on
my first page I want all my genres to be
displayed and every article is put under
a particular genre hence the name enter
and your app should be created so I go
back to my pycharm and as you can see
here we have our app genre created in
here now under this app there are more
number of files so what do these files
do we'll discuss that first well first
is our migrations folder now inside this
migration folder there'll be a number of
files which will be created once we go
through our project we'll see every time
we execute a particular command a new
file is inserted into the migrations
folder so this basically connects your
database with your source code and that
might seem very complicated but actually
Lee Django makes it extremely easy and
then you have the admins page now this
admin file or this admin page that
Django provides is extremely useful so
it's like the zummy admin page where you
can actually go and you can view your
entire database there in a very
formatted way you have all the models
that you created there you can insert
more values you can delete values you
can edit values which are already
present so right now the admin page will
not be existing there's no point of us
going and checking it right now since we
have not created any models yet again
what is models I'll come to that too so
that is the next file I'll be telling
you about now if you have gone through
object oriented programming python or
Java or any other object oriented
programming as a matter of fact you
probably know the concept of classes now
over here in our models file we create
classes and each of this class is
actually a model and by that we mean
it's a database so when we create a
class we have a number of attributes in
this class and each of this attribute
forms a column in our database so that
is what will be happening here and once
we create our class or what we call
model that is when we can actually view
the admin page and we'll see how this
page is extremely helpful the next
important page is the viewers page so
guys if you remember initially I told
you that Django has a design pattern
which is the model view template where
model is already discussed they are the
classes template as you probably guessed
is the look of the page so that's
basically a HTML files and what brings
the model and the template together that
is the view so view adds the
functionality now whenever you receive a
request from the user for a particular
URL view will describe the response for
this request but view is not responsible
for giving the response that is another
file that we'll be creating as you'll
see in some time so now when I go back
to my web page sure there's no URL for
this this is just a domain name but once
we start creating our website the very
existence of each web page is linked to
a presence of a URL so that is exactly
where we'll start building under a
Django project folder we have this URLs
page there's already a URL path present
here it says admin which is as you
guessed it's the URL to the admin page
that is by default provided by Django
and over here there's this another
parameter so what this parameter is it's
the response that is to be given for the
request that you receive now just in
this manner we need to add the URL for
our first page which is going to be the
genres page so I say path genus and then
in here I'll insert the action so I've
not created any action yet so I don't
know what to put in there either as of
now but guys think about this so if our
website has 10 pages does this mean that
we'll have 10 different URLs going in
here that would be quite half a sad
wouldn't it so we need a more organized
way of doing this and for that very
purpose we will use genres the app as
our base app so if from genres we are
moving on to our second page so say our
genres has our three genres which is
fiction inspiration and something else
so user clicks on fiction and this
immediately takes the user to the second
page where the content in fiction is
displayed so then our second page should
be a sub page of genre in a way and
every other page that we move to from
our first page should be the same so for
this purpose what we can do is we'll go
to a genres app the package will create
another URLs file within journal and in
this URLs file we'll Define the URL for
a second page with reference to our
genres URL so how is that done well the
first thing you need to do is you must
copy paste the statement here into our
URLs page for this page we do not really
need to import include so I'll remove
that part out and I also need to Define
my URLs pattern so copy paste this too
but again admin is already defined there
completely we do not require that now
here we'll say if the user wants the
page on us this is going to be my first
page that is my front page so what will
be the response to this the response
will obviously be defined in our views
page right now we have not created
anything in our views page but we will
soon and we will name the response for
the URL join us as index since that is
usually what the purpose of the front
page is it's usually to display the
index so we'll have view dot index and
then following this we'll also give a
name to this very particular call and
the purpose of that I will explain later
just name this index for now it's not
view it's views and also we need to now
import views okay so we Define that if
the user goes to the space genre then we
will be displaying whatever is defined
under views.index of course we have not
created that yet and we'll move on to
that in a while now the problem is every
request that is made by the user the
first thing Django does is it checks the
URLs page under your main project which
is this page and under this page we have
not defined the action for genres and it
would be very repetitive to Define this
again so what we do instead is we'll
just include the file where we did
Define the function for genres and that
is genres dot URLs so the user gives a
request for the genres page Django
checks out this main URL speech it sees
it matches the URL to this very
particular pattern here and for that it
knows that the response is to include
the genres.url page so it includes this
page and within this page we of course
have the function or the response
defined so now the next thing is is to
create the response so now under this
views file we'll create a view the first
thing is we need to import the HTTP
package the request is always HTTP and
this time the response that we are
providing is also a HTTP response we'll
change this later because we'll need a
more defined response but for now we'll
stick to a very basic display on our
first web page so let's import
django.http import HTTP response and now
we can define a function which will tell
what response to provide for the
particular URLs now here we say that if
the user gives a request for this URL a
response is views.index so within views
we need to define a function named index
So Def index and this one takes request
as a parameter and returns a HTTP
response and that response could be a
Simple Text of course you can also have
http General tags and just for the
purpose of formatting so that our text
looks pretty bold I'll put this into a
header just say hello world so that's
done this is the response that we'll be
providing for that particular URL now
the thing is we have this page here
settings and in settings if you scroll
down you'll see there's a list of apps
which are installed and in this list our
app genre is not mentioned so before we
run our server We'll add our app to this
list so that's done now go to your web
page the one where you ran your
localhost first and this time okay so my
server's not running I need to start my
server first type in your command python
manage dot py run server and it says
that there's no issue and a server is
currently running so you go back to the
page where we run a local host so the
last thing we ran a local host currently
your page would still be on that if you
have not done any modifications I did a
few in between hence I got this page age
now if you check out localhost again
you'll see that there's an error this is
because now we started defining the URLs
in our URL page so when you don't give
any URL as such Django checks out the
two URLs defined here and sees hey what
you typed in here whatever your request
was does not match any of the URL
patterns so now we want to check out the
genres page and enter and as you see
here hello world is displayed so of
course this is a dummy page we need to
do something way more we need to create
a web page and that is what we'll get to
okay so now that we viewed our dummy web
page the next thing we need to do is
actually populate this app with some
data now to populate the app with data
of course we need to first store the
data and that is stored in a database so
with Django you would have probably
already noticed here this is file called
sqlite3 so this is the database
management system that comes along with
Django it's already set up to be used
just a small all command a small tweak
that we require and everything will work
perfectly fine so what this does is
basically all the data that you enter
through your model will work along with
this so that means that there should be
a communication between your sqlite and
your source code now if I go back to the
terminal where I ran my server you'll
see here there's an error line which
says you have 15 unapplied migrations
and your project may not work properly
right now what we designed worked right
because we didn't have any data stored
but from now on we will be storing data
so we need to ensure that the migrations
are done right and by migrations we mean
that our database management that's
sqlite is synced pretty well with our
source code so first of all stop your
server and now you run a command to do
the syncing which is python manage dot
py migrate and as you hit this command
the syncing is happening so when you say
that the migrations are complete what
you actually mean is when Django looks
at your installed apps this is an app
that we created and we just added it a
while back to this list of installed
apps but everything else in here in this
list was already present so these are
some default apps with Django or this
project in particular will already work
with and many of these apps require to
access some databases it could not do
that until now but now that we've
finished our migrations when Django
checks out these apps and needs to run
them it can easily access the database
take whatever data is required from
there and perform its functions again if
we go back to a command prompt and run
the server again you'll see that this
time we do not get the error of the
unapplied migrations so that is how you
sync your database with your source code
now once we create our models it means
that we have added some new classes
there are some new tables which are
going to be added so again we need to
perform the migration function which
we'll look into later now let's get to
creating our classes so as I mentioned
earlier models are basically classes now
there are two classes that we will be
creating for this particular project the
first class will have all these genres
and the second class which will hold all
the Articles so let's begin coding now
my first class I'll call it collection
and every class needs to import from
Models dot model now within this class
all we need to define areth various
attributes so I'll explain this again
the class is basically a table and all
your attributes of the particular class
are the columns so the first thing is
the collection name or the genre name
now the collection name would be
something like a fiction or inspiration
or non-fiction could be anything and all
these are strings so when you are
inputting them so in Django basically
that's the cache field type if you say
models dot care field and a compulsory
parameter here is you have to insert the
max maximum length I'll give it 100
characters next thing we'll have a
description for each genotype that again
would be careful enter a max length give
it 500 and then we'll also have an image
or a cover for each of the collection or
each of the genre so that would be a say
call cover as in collection cover so
this again will be a care field type as
I'm going to enter the link for the
image over here now the Links would be
pretty large so I'd say a length of 1000
so that's our first class now we'll
Define a second class which is for the
particular articles or the pieces which
are inside the collection so here we'll
just go for one article within a
collection and I'll name this class as
piece as in a piece within a collection
again this class 2 imposter models dot
model and we will enter the column names
now so every piece will have a title
which would be the name of the page and
that too would be of care field type
give this a 200 and then all of these
will have a particular type that is
whether it's a book it's a novel it's a
poem or it's a blog post that is what
will go in a type variable next we'll
have the artist name for a book that
would be an author for a poem that would
be a poet so we'll go for the general
term which is artist the year it was
published now the year would be an
integer so we have a different field
type here the integer field and that
does not require a max length and
finally again for each piece you'll have
a cover so I'll name that piece cover
again we'll pass the link of an image
here so care field with the max length
of 1000 and yeah so our two models are
created here class collection and class
piece now once again we'll do the
migration and what will happen is that
the database will link with this model
and then we can finally view the admin
page and see what exactly that admin
page is that we've been talking about
all this while but before we move on we
are missing out on something so we have
our collection and we have each piece
how do we link the piece with the
collection well this is where the
concepts that you probably learned in
database is Gonna Come into use this is
where we'll use a foreign key so
although we are writing a code here this
is exactly how a table in a database
will be created so every item would have
a primary key and now we are going to
use foreign keys in a class piece to
link each piece to a particular
collection so if I say Dan Brown's book
origin so that should be linked through
the foreign key with our collection
fiction so let's create our foreign key
and I'll name it collection but this
time with a small C models dot foreign
key so to the foreign key you pass the
table name to which you're making the
reference first which is collection and
then you pass on an action as to what
will happen to a particular piece if the
collection that it's linked to is
deleted so what we want is if suppose
fiction is deleted then automatically
origin which is tied with fiction should
also be deleted and that is called a
Cascade delete so you say on delete
models dot Cascade and now we are
finally done creating our models so now
that our models are created we know
these particular models are created for
our application or our app genre so you
go back to the settings page and here we
had previously inserted this app genre
but back then it was not really required
it was just that there is this other app
that is not included in the default apps
given by Django so let's put in the name
there but now that we actually have a
database associated with this app we
need to specify this app in its complete
structure that is the the configuration
so if you go under genres and then
there's this file apps and under apps
you can see this class genre config copy
this go back to settings so genre dot
apps dot genreconfig so now when you run
your server Django will check the list
of installed apps and you'll be able to
access the database associated with our
newly created app too but there's more
to it than that remember how previously
we made migrations so we can link our
database with the source code now we got
to make those migrations again because
now we created new models so every time
you create a model or you make some
changes to your models you always need
to do your migrations and this time
since our migrations is specific to a
particular app the syntax is slightly
different so you can also use this
terminal down here it works just the
same and python manage dot py make
migrations and your app name enter and
as you see it says the models collection
and piece have been created now what
this migrations exactly does is it
converts these models that you have
written in coded format into an SQL form
so that's where your tables and
everything stored and now if you check
your migrations folder you'll see
there's a new file under it that is a
current migration that you attempted so
now that the migrations are made you can
finally run your project so once again
an overall migrations so I'm back to my
command prompt since the black
background makes it easier to see the
text break out of your server and we
finished our migration so now we can run
our server no issues and there's no
error with the migrations either let's
now check out a genre page of course
it'll look the same because although we
created our models what the models will
be reflected in is the database the
overall look of the page so far has not
been changed so it's a same so I'll
repeat that once again every time you
make a change to your model or you add
some new class to your model first run
the migrations for that particular app
that is python manage.py make migrations
and your app name and then you run a
migrations in general so that's python
manage.py migrations and then you can
run your server okay so our database is
created but right now it's empty so next
step is to populate our database for
that again open a command prompt and now
you need to enter into the sqls shell so
the command for that is python manage
dot py shell but before that I'll just
go to the path where my project is
stored and now in here I'll execute my
command so once you get these three
arrows you know that you have entered
the shell and over here you can execute
your SQL commands now before we input
values into our tables what we need to
do do is we have to import these tables
because even within this project there
are multiple number of tables there are
some tables which were in there by
default too so from genre dot models
import collection come up piece which
are the name of our tables and enter so
our tables are now imported now first
we'll populate our table collection okay
so collection has three columns there's
the collection name there's a
description and there's a cover image so
go back to your shell so we'll have an
object here collection one which will be
equal to collection so this would be the
Constructor for our class collection and
within this we'll insert our values so
our first attribute is collection name
and that's equal to fiction a second
attribute is the description and we'll
say enter the world of fantasies for the
description of fiction and finally we
have the attribute called cover which is
the collection cover and in here I'll
just enter the URL of an image I found
online so that's it we have entered the
values for our three attributes now
press enter now let's view if this
actually is stored in a database so for
that you execute the command your table
name which is collection Dot
objects.all and it's empty so what's
wrong we created an object in which we
inserted all the values but then still
our database seems to be empty so this
is because so far this collection object
that we created is only stored in our
Shell's memory we have not actually
committed this to the database so the
command for commenting this to the
database would be our object name which
is called one dot save and once again
we'll execute the command to check
everything that's present in our
database collection and now you can see
finally that there is an object present
and now we can also check the value of
the various columns in our table
collection for this particular object
you can say call 1 dot collection name
and gives you the collection name
similarly you can also check its
description now as I mentioned
previously every object that you create
in a table has a primary key associated
with it so the primary key basically
holds the uniqueness of that particular
row so we can also check the primary key
for a particular row or an object just
go for call one dot PK and it says the
primary key is one now the primary key
is also known as the ID of the object so
you can identify it as id2 again you'll
get the value which is 1. now if you
want to change the value of any of these
columns that can also be done very
easily on the shell so suppose I want to
change the description say call 1 dot
description and initially it was enter
the world of fantasies I wanted to be
well welcome to the world of fantasies
so welcome to the world of fantasies and
now if I check the value of call one dot
description the value has changed so
that's pretty simple isn't it now if you
think this is simple there's a much much
more simpler way of adding values to the
database which we'll see just in a while
and that is where we'll put in more
objects we'll have a few more genres and
we'll also add elements to our table
piece so now we can look into how to
create our admin page so now that we
learned how to input or populate our
database through the Shell let's go for
the easier and the more efficient way
which is through the admin now before we
do that we need to create a admin and
for that go to your command prompt out
of the shell now in your command prompt
type the command python manage dot py
create super user okay so once you do
that they'll ask you to create a
username and we'll just go for admin
since we are creating ourselves as the
admin enter enter an email ID just go
with admin123 at admin.com and a
password so since this is not a
production environment I'm gonna just
bypass the password validation but if
your website is going into the real
world then make sure things are secure
enough and our super user is created
successfully so now we can go on to a
browser and here we'll just type admin
so this is our admin page you can see
here there are two tabs groups and users
but the main thing the main reason that
we require the admin page does not seem
to come out here we expected there to be
our database tables present here so we
can directly go and edit them or add
some values to them but it's not there
so what is missing is that we need to go
back to our python page and over here go
down to the admin file so here we need
to add the models that we want to appear
in the admin page basically we need to
register those models with the admin
page and for that the first thing we do
is we have to import the model so from
dot models import and our two classes
our collection and piece so we have not
added anything to our table piece yet we
will later on but any how we'll just
register both of them at one shot and
you type in here admin Dot site dot
register collection copy paste this and
change the collection to piece which is
our second table and that's it so with
just these two lines of code you should
have your collection and your P Stables
appearing in the admin page now when I
move back to the admin page and refresh
this you'll see that our tables have
appeared here click on collection and
there's one collection object here click
on that you can see the values of the
attributes and through this admin page
now I'll show you how you can add more
objects so just press on Save and add
another here we can enter our second
collections name which in my case is
inspiration and description would be be
inspired to do more and for call cover
which is the collection cover I have
another link that I just took from the
net save and we'll add one more so we'll
have three collections now and our third
collection would be horror the
description let's say the fear is real
although we hope it's not and finally we
have the collection cover paste the link
here save this too so now we have three
objects under collection now as you see
here all our collection objects just say
collection object with the number in
bracket in the similar manner when we
were also going through our shell every
time we executed the command
collection.objects.all we got just the
name collection object and a number but
we want something more meaningful so
when I look at this table of collections
I know that the first one is the
collection fiction the second one is the
collection inspiration and so on so for
that go back to your code so go under
your models.py file and under the class
collection we'll Define a special method
which is double underscore Str now this
is an overriding method that is this
method already defined but the value
returned by this method is not of much
meaning to us as if now so now over here
we'll return something that we actually
want to see when we look at the objects
in our table collection and what I want
is I want the collection name to appear
that would be quite clear as to what
object is at which position so I say
action return self dot collection name
and that should do it now in the similar
manner we can have the same function for
piece 2 and for peace what we want to
return is the title so that's it now if
I go back to my admin page refresh this
as you can see we have something much
more meaningful under our table
collection now the objects actually have
a name well the objects don't actually
have a name but we are displaying one of
the attributes of the object and that
gives more clarity as to what the object
holds so now we'll start creating our
views now as I mentioned earlier our
website would be such that the first
page that the user goes to is probably
going to be the genres page which will
have the URL genre slash and with
nothing following it so the function for
that particular URL or the response for
that particular URL we defined in here
in our URLs page under the genres app
which is we'll be calling the index
function in views that is this function
now from that page there will be certain
links and when the user clicks those
links he or she can move to another web
page and that is the webpage where the
particular article present inside our
collection would be displayed so I'll
just put down in comment what pattern of
the URL we are matching for each of
these path so the first one that we are
matching is just genre followed by
nothing now our next PATH would be genre
followed by a number now this number one
here is actually the ID of the
collection that the user chooses so if
the user chooses the collection fiction
which is our first collection that has a
primary key one so immediately the user
should be sent to the next web page
which is genre slash one where one
represents the ID of the collection
chosen by the user so now for path let's
pass the expression that will match this
particular URL and that Expressions
actually just an integer number since
the front part that is genre slash is
already matched and this integer number
we are going to store it in a variable
because we'll require that variable
later so you can just say int colon and
collection ID now when you do this and
Jonas ID so when you do this what
happens is that this one gets stored in
this variable genre ID and this pattern
will match this URL now when this URL is
matched what response do you want to
give that is what you want to display on
that particular web page that will be
defined in another function we'll Define
underviews we'll name it details for now
of course details is not defined we'll
do that in a while and give a name to
this two which will be the same details
so now we are able to recognize this URL
what we need to do is next we need to
Define details which will give a
response to that URL so so go to your
views page and you create your details
function now what is displayed in this
details function greatly depends upon
the genre that is chosen by the user in
the first page which is stored again in
genre's ID so over here you pass not
only the request but also genre ID and
inside you'll return a HTTP response The
Collection the genre ID is the HTML tags
also need to be within the codes copy
paste that in here have code here too
and now one more thing we need to do is
so genres ID is an integer but we cannot
concatenate an integer with a string so
we need to convert this to a string and
that's it so let's go back to our web
page and run this page so the first page
which is genres displays hello world now
if I enter genre slash one which is what
we created new only from the code you
see here the genre ID is one in a
similar manner even if I enter 5
although we don't have a collection five
and let's play the genre ID is five now
these are dummy web pages so this kind
of a display is fine of course once we
actually start building our view which
we will do very soon things will be more
defined now let's get to actually
creating a good view so what we want
here is uh first of all we do not want
to display any large text so let's
delete that off we need to import our
models because this is where our
database is and of course we need to
fetch information from our database to
be displayed on our view so from dot
models import collection and piece now
in a index function what we'll do is
we'll first collect all the objects from
our table collection we'll have a
variable which is all collection and
then to collect all the the objects
we'll use the same SQL command that we
used so so that's collection dot objects
so all your objects in the collection
table will be stored in all collection
now we'll store this as a dictionary so
that we can iterate over these objects
and display them one by one so we say
context equal to all collection is the
key and the value would be our variable
all collection so that's done now we
need to iterate over this so do we do
that within our views itself but there's
no point of doing that because while we
are iterating over every object in our
collection table we also need to display
them in a certain format that means that
we need these objects to be somehow
embedded in a HTML file and this is
where we create our very first HTML file
for our first page which is the genres
page so to create a HTML page inside
jono create another package and you name
this package templates now inside
templates create another folder and give
this package the name same name as your
app name that is genre and now inside
genre we can create a HTML file I'll
name this file genre template so all our
template or our HTML files will be in
this path okay so before we actually
develop the genre template HTML file
we'll go back to our view and complete
the section off so now what we are
seeing is that we have a template we
have a HTML file and that file will
Define how we need to display the
objects in our collection database or
our collection table all we need to do
here in our index function is actually
pass these objects to our HTML file so
for this we have a function render and
before we actually use the function we
need to import the library Django Dot
shortcuts under which we have this
function render this is already imported
on top I'd not see that so I'll just
remove that part out and now that you
have the render function you use that to
pass your object so what this render
function does is basically we'll pass
context to it it will type context with
the template name that we pass and it
will return a HTTP response object so
you pass your request you pass the path
to your template that is Geno slash
templates slash genre
genre template dot HTML so now you have
passed your template to and finally the
object which is context so that's pretty
much all you need to do for your very
first view under the views file now we
need to develop our genres template so
for our HTML file first thing we'll
change the title let's display our app
name so in this particular case since
I'm making a dummy website I'm not
giving it a name or anything just going
with our app name okay so now we need to
display our objects which have been
passed from the views folder now the
render function basically passes an
object which is called object underscore
list so we'll create a for Loop say
collection in object underscore list so
this way we can iterate through all the
objects in our object list and now see
this is an HTML file but this line of
code here this is the python code so
pretty often this will happen that you
need to embed a python code within your
HTML file so what you do is you insert
your python code within curly brace
followed by the percentage sign this
will tell you compiler that hit although
this is a HTML file this line here is
actually a python instruction so now we
are able to extract each genre in fact
I'll name this variable as genre obj now
we need to decide how exactly we want to
display these objects so what I want is
first I want the image of that
particular collection or the genre to be
displayed which is what I've stored in
one of the variables and then just below
the image I want the name of the genre
to be displayed now this name should be
clickable so that the minute the user
clicks on it we can move on to another
page and then just below the name I want
the description for that genre to be
displayed okay so first we have the
image IMG source and in here I need to
insert the link for that particular
image so the link I actually already
stored in my database as I showed we did
that through the shell and then later on
through the admin page too so how do we
access that particular link well just
like you would in a python code you can
access it through the variable name and
every time you are accessing or you're
displaying just the value of a variable
you insert the variable name within
double braces so double braces and then
Jonah obj dot call cover and now I'll
give it some height and width to make it
look a little more appealing we'll have
minimal formatting here because the
objective of this tutorial is not to
show you how to write your HTML code but
how Django works and next I'll have the
name as I said this particular name
would be clickable so inside href I will
insert the URL of the page the user
should be taken to once he clicks on the
name so that URL is what we defined here
okay so it's genre followed by the
primary key or the ID of the category
that he clicked so that would be genre
slash and we stored it in genre ID so
that's the link the user will be taken
to and now the name that will be
displayed and then after that finally we
have the description to be displayed so
that'll be in a H3 header again double
braces because we are going to just
print out the value of a variable and
then after each object's details are
displayed we'll break a line for better
formatting what I'll do is I'll have all
of this embedded within a div and have
it aligned to the center so that's it we
have created our HTML file here one more
thing I'll just say end for so that's it
a HTML file or our complete display for
the first page has been created so once
again I'll explain what will happen in
the case of a first page only when the
user enters the URL slash genre followed
by nothing Django will first check this
URLs page the main URL page it'll see
the path has matched here and the action
for this has been defined as you include
the genres dot URL page so it goes to
the genres.url page includes this and in
this there's a function defined as a
response for this particular URL a very
well defined function which is in our
views file so it goes to the viewers
file and in the viewers file we have
completely defined our function index
over here we collect all the objects in
our collection table we convert that
into a dictionary so that it's iterable
then we pass it using the render
function so the render function will
take your template and it will tie that
along with the context which is the
dictionary and it will pass an object a
response object to a HTML file this
response object will be called object
dot list and it is iterable so we'll
iterate through the object we will
display each object in a sort of
formatted way and that is it and then
the render function will pass this
object all collection to our template
and over here we will iterate over the
all collection which is the dictionary
and using this HTML code here we'll
print out the objects in all collection
in a formatted way so that's it and one
more thing make a small correction back
in the views file so initially I had
inserted the entire path to genre
template dot HTML so the thing with the
render function is that it automatically
knows that it must look into the
templates folder so you have to only
give the path after the template that
the genre genre template now let's go
back to our browser
and in here put in your url
and there you go so that's our first web
page you can see the image for our genre
is here and then you have the name and
then you have the description okay so
that's redirecting us to a page where
there's an error it says that this path
is not found so when you look at this
error guys you will understand better as
to how the matching of the URL patterns
take place first this URL pattern just
this part after your port number that is
checked against the URL in your main URL
file that is Django
projects.url file where we have defined
just genre and then after that it will
check the files that we included in the
genres URL file that is genre followed
by the the genre ID now we had defined a
dummy page for this previously and that
was being displayed too so I'll go back
to the code and figure out what the
error is the error is here of course I
wrote owner ID which does not signify
anything as such now because here we
have this object genre obj that is where
all the objects from The Collection
table are stored one by one so what we
actually need to access is the ID for
genre obj now I'll go back to my browser
so now I'm back to my browser and as you
can see here we still have our front
page click on fiction and yeah we got a
dummy page back so now our next step is
to design this page go back to your code
and again
designing the page means we need to
start putting content into our details
function now before we start designing
this function we need to populate the
piece table so again let's go back to
our admin page We'll add the data
through the admin page since that's much
easier here you have peace and click on
the add button
first we'll add for fiction the title
will give let's insert the book origin
so the artist would be done round and
it's a novel and the year is 2017.
that's a year of publication and for the
peace cover I'll just put the book
Origins front page cover I'll just put
in the image here a link save and add
another
now for inspiration I'll put in the poem
If and type would be poem artist is
Rudyard Kipling Kipling with single P
the year of publication would be 1895
and for the peace cover another link
and finally We'll add one to horror the
title would be the pet symmetry
written by Stephen King
and again this is a novel it's published
in the year 1983.
and then link and we save this so we are
done for each of the categories of each
of the genre we have added a single
article so now that our table piece is
also populated we can start designing
the view for this
so for our Details page let's start with
removing this HTTP response here
so first what we need to do is we need
to extract the object that the user
selected from our genres page so we say
collection
dot objects
dot get
p k equal to genre ID so what we are
doing here is as you can see above we
use the query
collection.objects.org which returned
all the objects in our table collection
now here we are telling that okay I want
just one object from my collections
table and that particular object is the
one whose primary key matches that
stored in the variable genre dot ID and
since genre dot ID is defined in this
file and it's basically the ID of the
genre that the user selected
this
will be a number either one two or three
that is one for Fiction two for
inspiration and three for horror so now
that we got that object we will use this
object C item
to extract from a piece table so for
that we say piece dot object dot filter
and to this we pass
and the category that we filter on is
the collection and that is our foreign
key so remember when we created our
table piece we had a foreign key named
collection so we're seeing if collection
is equal to C item then extract that
particular object from a table piece and
then we will return this again through
the render method
pass the request
and in here we'll have the path to an
HTML file just like we did in the
previous case but this time a different
HTML file because we want to display
this slightly differently
and then finally we need to pass the
context so we haven't created the
context yet which we will now although
this is just one item every time we are
passing it through the render function
you need to make a dictionary out of it
so just copy paste this here name this P
item
item
and just now I did create a HTML file in
the same path as before that is under
templates you have the genre folder and
under that I created a HTML file called
detail template nothing's filled yet but
now that we have created a file we can
put in the path here
so just copy paste this and change the
genre to detail so that's done too now
all we have left is to actually code the
HTML file
so I'll just copy paste this
here and then make the required
correction
so in P item
and this would be piece object
you align its Center and piece obj is
the cover we do not really need a head
shref here
so delete that part out because this is
the final page we are not redirecting to
any other page from here of course when
you're building a complete web page this
ideally when you click on the name of an
article the article should open
we wouldn't be including that part here
though because it does not bring out any
new functionality of Django
peace obj and here so peace obj dot
title
Dash and then we'll print out the author
or the artist name so peace obj dot
artist
and finally we can have the year
also what this particular article is
that is the type
so that's pretty much it we'll change
the title to
[Music]
so now that this is done we'll just end
the for Loop
also this is not call cover but now
we're going to change it to piece cover
and now we'll go back to our browser so
this is genre page refresh it once again
and we'll click on one of the genres and
yeah as you see
the particular piece related to that
genre gets displayed the patch Symmetry
by Stephen King which is a novel
published in the year 1983. so now we're
back to our code and well our first Anna
second page is designed it's working
fine so now we are not going to create
something new instead what is already
created let's modify that now so far the
functions that we wrote work just fine
but Django provides this thing called
generic classes or generic views what
this does is it makes writing these
functions extremely easy so now you have
four lines of code the exact same thing
can be done in like two or three lines
of code
in fact it's not just the easier method
this is also recommended
so I'll tell you how that is done first
of all we need to import the generic
package so from Django
dot views
import
generic and now let's delete this entire
thing
so our first function is basically
listing out all the objects in the table
so you have multiple objects all of them
are being listed out now this kind of a
function
would belong to a generic class so far I
was defining functions now I'm speaking
about class so is it a function or a
class well it is a class
it's definitely a class but I'll show
you how this class is called as a
function so first we'll finish writing
the class now we have the class index
and this particular Class Type is a list
view because we are listing out objects
now under this first we'll have a
template name which is the path to our
template
and now to return our query set so
previously we were always returning a
dictionary now we can return a query set
we have a function diff query set
and under this we just say return
collection dot objects dot all so the
same query we were using previously but
now we do not need to take the objects
from the query and then convert them
into a dictionary then pass it on using
the render function we can simply do
this one statement and all our objects
will be sent to a template
where now in the template so far we were
seeing all collection because that is
the key that we were using in our
dictionary but that is no more we are
not using the render function anymore
when this query set passes an object
it's received by the template file
in a variable named object list
so you replace your previous variable
with object list
and that is it with that we finished
the method for displaying our first page
now we'll move on to the second page so
the second page is slightly different
because this time we are not listing out
multiple objects we just have one object
and we are basically giving out the
details of the object that means that
this class
which we'll still call details is a
detailed view class so we say generic
Dot
detail View
let's delete all of this first now the
function of this detail view is
basically to display the details of an
object
so what we need to do is first we need
to define a model now our model is
collection
because we are receiving the primary key
from the collection and each of this
object actually is a part of a
collection the object would not exist if
the related or the counterpart genre of
that object did not exist so a model is
collection and our template name will be
again the path
so that genre
detail template
dot HTML and that's it so this is even
smaller than our generic view now in a
detailed template initially we have the
name of the key in our dictionary again
this time we don't have a dictionary
pass so what is the value here well the
value here would be collection dot peace
underscore set dot all so this will
return all the pieces related to that
particular collection
and everything in small this time
now we are almost done go back to your
views and you see this is a generic
detail view now the thing about the
detail view class is
it always accepts one parameter go back
to your URLs file as you are passing
here a variable gen uh genre underscore
ID of in type you don't need to do that
anymore you can simply say PK and PK
will be passed to this class and now
that's the problem so here we were
calling functions but now we have
classes Define not functions anymore so
we need to figure out a way of calling
this class as a function so for that you
just say as underscore view for both of
these classes
and that's it as simple as that now you
can call your classes as a function and
since you use the generic view now
things have become so much more simpler
much smaller our code looks very neat
now let's go back to our browser go to
our front page let's see if everything
is displayed right yes it is so a
changes worked out just fine click on
one of these tags and as you can see the
page has loaded so much less code very
few lines of code but things work just
as fine as before so web page is all
built but let's add something new over
here to make it look a little more like
a website one of the most common things
that you find in every website you go to
is a navigation bar so let's add the
navigation bar go back to your code now
in here
we need a navigation bar in both our
pages so typically what you might think
is the way to go about it is add the
code for navigation bar in your genre
template and detail template but as you
know whenever your code repeatability is
something that you should be always
against minimum repeatability
so instead what we do is under genre the
same folder that has all our templates
create another HTML file and name this
base so this will be a base template and
we will add the code for creating a
navigation bar in here and then we'll
just include this base in our other
templates so first let's create our
navigation bar now we'll be using
bootstrap to create the navigation bar
and every time you work with bootstrap
the first thing you need to do is in
your head section include these three
links so if you have worked with
bootstrap you've probably already know
you need to go to the bootstrap website
copy these links paste them here so
you're basically able to access some
style sheets which are stored in some
other system and once that's done you
can start building your navigation bar
it's in your body
you have nav class
navbar and navbar default
so this is the class for creating your
basic navigation bar
but actually we'll go with inverse
instead of default so this has a dark
theme navigation bar it will look better
on our white background website
within this create a div tag
of container fluid so basically what the
container fluid does is that
your navigation bar will occupy the
entire page
and it'll fit according to the page
width
now under this you have
the navbar brand class
and the first icon I want is
my home
okay so I put in home here and when I
click on home whatever I want to be
redirected to
whichever page I want to be redirected
to put the link for that or the URL for
that in here
and I'd like to be redirected to the
genres page since that's our home page
now other elements we can include in a
navigation bar
we put them as list elements so class
navbar
and we want these elements to the right
of a navigation bar so we say nav bar
right now I'm not going into the details
of this since again this is not a part
of the Django tutorial so we'll quickly
just create the navigation bar now every
element to the right will be listed out
and I'll have a registration button so
that will be under genre slash
register now I have not created the view
for this URL yet in fact this URL is not
even identifiable yet
but for now I'll just put that in and
we'll run it all together
and finally add the very right and
corner of my navigation bar I want to
display the username that is whichever
user is currently going through my
website now yeah right now we have not
designed the features for all of this we
don't have a registration form itself so
a user does not mean anything to us
right now but very soon I'll show you
how you can create a registration form
you can have users register to it so
then this will start making sense
so we'll say alike class and in here
the way you can extract the current user
of your website is you say request dot
user
and that's it that's pretty much all we
need right now
just check all the tags again we have
the navbar inverse which is the type the
look of our navigation bar container
fluid and here we actually need to
specify that it's a header so we say div
class
navbar header
well this would be closing right in the
end
so I'll just format this once
and finally down here you insert two
python statements you say
block content
uh content is a variable so you can have
any other name here just say block
content and then end block
so why this I'll explain to you in a
while
so basically this entire part creates
your navigation bar but you require this
navigation bar to be present in multiple
pages so here when you say block content
and N Block it's basically the content
that will fall in each of the pages so
if I go to my genre template page I can
simply include the base template here
and then everything inside the genre
template page all this instruction to
actually create that page will come
under a block
so what we'll do here is we'll go to our
template pages and here we will extend
our base.html file so extends
Jonah slash
base dot HTML
and then
the body the instructions within the
body will be the content of the block
so you say block content
and then end block
now we do the exact same thing with our
detail template
so now this way we created a common base
file for a navigation bar and the
content for each of these templates will
be by Tone included within this tag here
so we'll have the navigation bar present
for every page
now when we move back to a browser you
see the change here there is a
navigation bar if you click on home will
be redirected to a genre page and then
click on one of the categories
and you have been redirected to the next
page the navigation bar is still present
so we also have a user here currently
the only user we created the super User
it's the admin this will change soon
once we start registering people
so next step is to create a form where
we can actually have users register so
for our registration page the first
thing we need to do is we need to create
a URL
and go in here
let's copy this line
so the recognizable URL would just say
register so it would be genres slash
register
and that would call
a views function
called user form
and we obviously haven't defined this
class yet so yeah this is also going to
be a class we are going to use the
generic view to create this two it's
going to be pretty simple but since it's
a class we need to call it as a function
so as view will still exist and we here
we'll have user form
but before we start actually creating a
view for the registration page or
writing our HTML file we need to create
a blueprint for the form so why a
blueprint for the form when we did not
create a blueprint for our other Pages
I'll tell you why but first we need to
comment this particular line because it
will result in an error and now we'll
check out our admin page
yes so this table here is what we'll be
using to store our usernames so the
tables already present here we'll just
tweak it a little that is we'll take the
username we'll take the email address
and we'll take a password field all of
these actually have a password if you
click on them you can see here the
password is hashed so these are the
three fields that we'll collect from the
user so we'll use the basic form
just selecting exactly what we need so
for that purpose we need to create the
blueprint so to create the blueprint
under genre create a python file calling
it forms
and now in here
we'll import that table we just saw that
database
so we say Django Dot contrib
Dot auth
dot models
import user
two Imports here so
and then we'll import the module forms
okay so now we can create a class called
user form
which will import from
s.model form
and in here we'll have a class called
meta So Meta basically means the
definition or a description of your
class so inside our class user form
we'll have a description for our class
and in the description we give a model
name so model name is user because we'll
be using that particular model I just
showed you and then we'll specify the
fields that we'll be using from this
model because we are not taking all the
fields we are going to ignore a few of
them so we say fields
create a list here and within the list
we'll enter the name of the attributes
that we'll be actually using for our
particular form so we have username
email and we'll take a password now
unlike username and email password is
not just any care field so over here we
have to specify the password type
so you say forms dot care field and
within brackets you say widget equal to
forms.password import
so password input so from this your
Django will know that here we basically
need to take the hashed values and not
just store what the user inputs as
characters
so that's it with that we have created
the blueprint of our form next thing is
we can actually go to the Views and
begin writing
the view the Class View for a form so
the class to create a form
would be called user form View
actually before we proceed we need to
import this so let's do that first
import user form
also need to import some other packages
here we'll import a few packages for
user authorization that's authenticate
and login
and now we can begin writing a user form
view class
so to user form you you pass the object
View
and we also need to import a class for
this so let's do that
chango
Dot views.gendrick
import View
okay so the first thing we need to
define a class for this form
and that would be the user form
and once again a template for this form
which will Define the Outlook this form
has so you give a template name which is
a variable name actually you can have
any variable name here just something
that makes sense
now I don't have a template page already
so I'm not as in I've not created
another HTML file for the form
specifically but I know that I'll be
creating it the part genre slash and the
name of the HTML file
so that would be form template now the
minute we are done writing this view
I'll show you how we do the template
that's just basic HTML code so I'm
pretty sure you know how to work with
that too
now with forms there are two things
there's the get method that is basically
when the user wants a form so you give
the user an empty form and there's a
post method that is when the user puts
in his or her details into the form
so with art class with a generic classes
these methods are already defined and
within two three lines you can
completely define the functionality of
these so first is the get method to
which we pass self and request
now the first thing is you provide the
form to the user and this form is empty
so you say self dot form
class
and you pass nothing to this because as
I mentioned earlier too the form is
empty and now what you do is you return
this object
through the render function so basically
when you do this
the form is combined with the HTML file
and an object is returned
so basically when you do this what
happens is as I mentioned earlier too
the render function works in the same
way it passes the object of the form the
content of the form to the template and
it basically sends out a HTTP request
so that's your template name and then
finally the form itself
and as we did previously this will be a
dictionary
and that is the get function
now we'll move on to the Post
again you pass self and request
now when the user enters the data and
then hits the submit button that's when
the post function will be called all the
data will be stored in a particular data
variable and that is what we will be
defining in the first line so form equal
to self Dot
form class
and request dot post
so all your data will go into this post
variable
now the next thing that the post
function has to do is check if the data
entered by the user does make sense
so for that you say if form dot is valid
so if the form is valid
save this data
so you say form dot save
so where exactly are we saving this well
as I showed you previously uh Django
provides this table for user this
database for storing the users and the
group users so that is exactly where
we'll be storing the data received
through this particular form
now if the data is valid we can
separate out the various Fields receive
the clean format
so first we have our username say
username equal to form Dot
cleaned data
and that will be username
and then you have the password
so remember when the user entered the
data itself it was stored in these
fields but now we're getting a clean
version of that data and storing it in
this these variables username and
password and now unlike how we can
usually put the equal to sign and assign
values to certain variables this kind of
a process is not possible for passwords
because passwords are not just storing
some CAD field data it has a hash value
I'll show you that once again so you see
here you go to the users
admin and if you check this out the
password is not actually stored as just
characters it's hashed using some
algorithm and then it's stored so in
this particular case we cannot say that
password is equal to this value there's
a certain function through which you
pass the password such that it's stored
in the required format
so for that you see user dot set
password
and then you pass password variable and
finally you see user dot save
so guys over here actually we are saving
the data
in the Shell not in your database and
once a data is cleaned and everything it
is then that we are saving it into the
database so that's why we have two save
statements here so now that the user has
entered their data and they have hit the
submit button we have saved the data in
our database what's next well now what
we want to do is we need to redirect the
user to the index page basically once
the user is done with the registration
process there's no point of the user
staying on the same page again so we
redirect them to the index page now
along with this we'll also combine login
so if the user's password and username
are authenticated and the user is an
active status that means that the user
has logged into our website so now we'll
see how this is done Creator object new
user and this object will hold a user if
the username and the password that we
pass here to this authenticate function
is actually valid and they match
that is the form of that is the form of
pair so the username will be the
variable username
and password will be the variable
password
so if the new user does exist
that is if new user
is not null
if the new user is not none
we'll check the status of the new user
so what is the status again I'll take
you back to that database
go to users
well since we're in the middle of the
code we cannot access this page but
basically this database or this table
which stores the usernames Has a Field
called status which you probably would
have noticed and next to the active user
there's a green tick so if the user has
that green tick if the user is active
that means his session is in progress so
it's basically like logging in
so you say if new user
dot is active
you log in the user if you send request
and the new user object
and once the user has logged in you
return the user to the index page and
this is where you need to use a function
redirect before we use that function we
need to of course import it
so here a redirect is within this same
shortcuts Library
we'll just add and redirect here
so index Pages basically called genre so
that's where the user will be taken
now if this user is not authenticated
that is there is some invalid data
entered
we basically give the user back a form
an empty form give them another chance
to fill it
so for that we just copy paste this line
here the render
put that down there
and that's it with that we are done
creating a view for our user form now
what we are left with is actually
creating this HTML file so let's do that
again go to genre your main folder and
create a HTML file now remember what we
named
a HTML file in this view that's form
template
make sure the same name
so let's start creating the form the
first thing we do is for the form two we
want to add the navigation bar so go to
your go to any of your HTML files and
copy out these lines here
registration
then you have the block content which is
exactly where you'll be putting all your
content
that goes here and then we'll start and
then we'll add the N block
again copy paste that too
okay so now we can start typing out a
HTML code
so first is a form tag
now there's going to be a extremely
simple straightforward form
and now the thing with Django is
whenever you're having a form an
interactive form make sure to include
this csrf token here so csrf stands for
cross-site request forgery
that can be sent actually from and it's
a type of cross-site scripting attack
that can be sent from malicious site
through your visitors browser to your
own server so to prevent this Django
provides a very simple technique which
is where you provide this csrf token now
make sure you're always providing this
whenever you have a post method and
you're not redirecting or you're not
using the URL of or you're not using an
external URL because that means that
your current page csrf token is being
sent to an external web page and
obviously that kind of a leakage would
hamper the security
okay so we'll be taking a username
again email is also type text
and finally the password
and after all the fields you have
finally the submit button
and that's it
so our HTML page is also ready now
so now you need to move on to the URLs
page
and uncomment this because now we
actually have a response
also this is called user form view now
I just stopped the server and run it
again although it's not really necessary
if you just go back to your page refresh
it everything works fine
okay now we will move on to our web page
okay so home page is working fine just
like before next you click on register
and here's your form so as you can see
here the navigation bar is present for
the form tool
now we'll create a new user
name simply with the email ID simply one
two three gmail.com
and the password
that's it now click the submit button
and the minute we click the submit
Button as you can see you got
transferred back to the home page and in
here if you see the right hand corner
you'll notice that we had admin before
but now it's simply so that is because
we just now created a user simply and
the minute you create a user by default
that becomes the active user now to
check this we will move on to the admin
page
and this is our landing page so now what
happened is that since the other user
that we newly created is the active user
that means we got logged out of the
admins profile and to view the admin
page of course we need to be logged in
as the admin so I log back in and as you
can see here under the users group
you'll notice we have a new user created
simply with the following email ID
so that's it guys hello everyone welcome
to this video tutorial on SQL basics for
beginners by simpler in this session we
will learn about the database and the
need for a database then we will
transition to SQL and see some basic SQL
queries after knowing what a SQL query
is we will see the features in
application superscript query and then
we will have a hand on some of the basic
SQL queries so hey everyone I'm Amisha
from Simply learn and welcome to this
video when SQL basics for beginners but
before we begin if you love watching
Tech videos subscribe to our Channel and
hit the Bell icon to now miss an update
let's start with database a database is
a vast collection of data that is stored
and retrieved electronically from a
system in today's world data has become
the new oil which has mandate companies
and businesses to rely on an excellent
database to store the vast amounts of
data
every millisecond the tech Giants are
accumulating vast amounts of data that
need to be stored the database comes
with features to update and effortlessly
manipulate data and not only that these
database provider companies ensure the
data to be safe and secure they also
provide tools to extract useful
information to help the companies make
meaningful decisions
after knowing about the database let's
see how SQL communicates with the
database to get desired results
SQL stands for structured query language
the structured query language is the
standard language used by database
operators and developers to carry out
different operations from manipulating
updating and retrieving data from
relational databases
now let us see how we write a basic
query there's a customer table with
columns customer ID customer name age
gender date of purchase address item and
price
and we need to extract the customer ID
and customer name from this table
so we will write a query select customer
ID comma customer name from customers
semicolon when we will execute the query
in MySQL workbench we will get the
desired result that is the output table
with customer ID and customer name this
is how we write a query to extract the
information from the database we'll see
some more queries as the session
proceeds
now we'll see what the features of SQL
are SQL lets you access any information
stored in a relational database with SQL
queries data is extracted from the
database in a very efficient way the
structured query language is compatible
with all database systems from Oracle
IBM to Microsoft and it doesn't require
much coding to manage databases
now we will see applications of SQL SQL
is used to create a database Define its
structure implement it and let you
perform many functions SQL is also used
for maintaining an already existing
database SQL is a powerful language for
entering data modifying data and
extracting data in a database SQL is
extensively used as a client server
language to connect the front end with
the backend the supporting the client
server architecture SQL when deployed as
data control language DCL helps protect
your database from unauthorized access
afternoon SQL with its features and
applications let's go through some basic
queries in SQL
that is ddl data definition language DML
data manipulation language DCL data
control language TCL transaction control
language ddl or data definition language
consists of the SQL commands that can be
used to define the database schema let's
see TDL commands create command is used
to create the database or its objects
like table index function views store
procedure and triggers drop is used to
delete objects from the database
truncate is used to remove all records
from a table alter is used to alter the
structure of the database
DML or data manipulation language
consists of the SQL commands that deals
with the manipulation of data present in
the database insert into command is used
to insert data into a table update is
used to update existing data within a
table delete is used to delete records
from a database table select this
command helps you to select the
attribute based on the condition
described by the workloads
tclo transaction control language these
commands deals with the transaction
within the database commit commands
commit a transaction
rollback command rollback is a
transaction in case of any error occurs
save point it sets a save point within a
transaction set transaction it specify
characteristics for the transaction
dcn or data control language it consists
of the commands such as Grant and revoke
which mainly deals with the rights
permissions and other controls of the
database system
Grant command gives user access
privileges to database
revoke it will draw users access
privileges given by using the grant
command now we will have hands on some
basic queries in MySQL workmench if
getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scale up by simply learn
click on the link in the description to
know more
now we'll see some basic queries
executing in MySQL workbench
so we'll start
and first query will run will be use
sys that is the database
this command is used to select the
database
in which we want to create or manipulate
any data now we'll see another command
that would create a table
now we will add attributes to the
customer table that would be the columns
first would be the customer ID
and we will
act it it as a primary key
The Next Step YouTube that would be
customer name customer underscore name
and its data type would be back there
next it would add BH
within data type
foreign
with character data type
next we will add as date of purchase
with date data type
now let another attribute that would be
addressed
with data type where care
next we will write the attribute item
that will be the item purchased with
data type webcare
next would be the price
okay for price we will make it as float
and let's shift this to next line and
now we'll execute this command
yeah you can see that the table is
created
now we have to insert values into it
for that we'll write a command insert
into
customers
values
and I have all the records written in
the notepad
so I will copy these
and paste it here
these are 20 records
like all the attributes there in the
order so we have written all the records
in the order only
like customer ID that will be one zero
one customer name that would be Joseph
age that would be 22 gender May rate of
purchase this is the date of purchase
address Pune
item that is vegetable purchased price
that is 80. so now we will run this
command and all these
records they would be inserted into the
table
and these are 20 commands 20 reports
you can see insert into customer values
the command has been executed and they
have been inserted into the table
now we'll see
the table
for that we'll write the command select
star
from
customers
here you can see the table
in the output grid
okay I'll make sure you will see the
whole table
with all the 20 codes
yeah
you can see
all the 20 reports they have been
inserted
now you see another command
and for that we would just
get the output as customer ID and
customer name in the output grid for
that we'll write the command select
customer ID
comma
customer name
from
customers
semicolon
and we'll run this command
and we will get both the columns
customer ID and customer name
in our output grid
now we'll see another command that would
be drop
the drop command just removes the
component from the database
so we'll write
drop
table
and table name that would be customers
and semicolon and we will execute this
command
now the table has been removed from the
database
to verify whether the table has been
removed from the database or not we will
run a command select star from
customers semicolon and execute this
command
and what we will get is Select start
from customers error code table says
customers doesn't exist the table has
been removed from the database so that
drop command worked here
now we don't have any table that is the
customer table has been dropped from the
database so we have to create that table
again
so we'll go at the top
k
yeah
and we'll create the table again
and we'll insert all the records again
into the table
include the commands have run
now we will
then this command to see whether the
table has been created and the records
have been inserted into the table or not
both commands have worked
and now we'll see another command
that would be Translate
the truncate command just manages all
the records from the table
truncate table
name
semicolon
and just run this command
the command has been executed
now we'll see
yeah you can see that all the records
from the table has been managed so the
concrete command worked here now to
carry other operations we have to insert
all the records again into the table
do that
will again go upwards
and run this command
insert into customers values and all the
records
and we'll execute this command and that
command has been executed and all the
records are again in the table so we'll
turn this command and check it
yeah you can see all the reports then
threaded into the table
now we'll see another command that would
be alter
alter command is used to update any
record into the table you will see
folder
table
table name that is customers
and now what we should do uh okay we'll
drop the column H from the table
so we'll write command drop
column
age
semicolon
I will run this command
the command has been executed
and now we'll check whether the H column
has been dropped or not
select star from customers
semicolon and we will execute this
command
yeah you can see the age column has been
dropped off the table
so the alter command has been executed
successfully
okay so now we'll see another thing uh
like if you want to comment something
during the execution you can do that
just write two minus signs and the text
this would be the comment
and you can also use
slash
start and that
text
inside it and start and Slash
so this is also the comment section
you can write comment with this index or
with this syntax they both work
now we'll see another command that would
be update
this is also used to manipulate data in
the table to update any record into the
table
so we will write update table name that
would be customers
and what we should update okay we will
update a record
uh we will change the customer name and
address
and we have the primary key as customer
ID so we will use that
so update customers
set
customer name
equal to
James
comma
and address
equal to uh poster
where
customer ID
equal to one zero one
okay you can see here in the table 101
customer ID the customer name is Joseph
and the address is Pune we have updated
command and we will execute it see okay
okay
we have an error here
uh yeah that's correct we'll execute
this command
where the command has been executed
successfully and now we check the table
with the command select star
from customers
semicolon
you can see the row has been updated
the customer name is James here and the
address is Boston so the command has
been executed successfully
now we'll see another command that would
be delete
so delete command is used to delete any
particular record for any particular row
so we will write the command delete
from
customers
there
customer ID
equal to one zero two
semicolon
so the second row that is with customer
ID 102 that would be deleted when we
will execute this command
now we'll check into the table
yeah you can see
the record has been deleted
now you'll see distinct command that is
used to return different values
so we will write command select
distinct
and the column name for which we want
different values to be in the output
grid
we'll select address
from
customers
and we will execute this command
yeah
these are the address so these are the
cities in the address
which are different and which are unique
and we have get that through the
distinct command
now we will see minimum command minimum
command is used to get the records or
get the data that is minimum of all the
data
so for that we will write the syntax
select
minimum
like Main in bracket we will write the
attribute name or the column name
for which we want the data to be minimum
as
less price
this would be the attribute name
from customers
so we will execute this command
and what we would see is that 60 would
be the last price
like the customer table they have the
column price and in that we all we have
all the prices and from that the minimum
price is 60 and we have get it at less
price
similarly we have the maximum command to
get the maximum amount from the column
we will use the maximum command
select Max
in bracket to write the attribute name
as
Max price
from customers
and we will execute this command
and what we get is 3400 it's the maximum
price from the price column
now we'll see another command that would
be count
command it Returns the number of rows
according to the query so we will run
the query and see like how it works
we'll write select
count
and the attribute name
that would be a customer ID
customer ID
from customers
semicolon
and when we will run this command
we will get 19 as a result that is it
counted the number of customer IDs that
is 19 in the table
now we'll see another command
that would be average
so it just gets the average of the
numbers and how we do it write the query
select
AVG and the attribute name for which we
want the average
from table name
semicolon
and we'll execute this command and we'll
get the average of the price
from the customers table
now if you want to add up all the prices
from the customer table you can use the
command sum so how you will execute that
command
select sum in bracket we would write the
attribute name that would be price
from
customers semicolon
and we'll run this command
and we'll get the sum of the prices from
the customer table
now we'll see where command
where command is used to filter records
let's see through syntax
so we will write select
star
from customers
where
address uh yeah we will
where address equal to
Pune you
semicolon
and then we will run this command
and yeah this is the taper we will get
the records with addresses Pune
so this is the functioning of where
command
now we'll see Group by command
that is used to just group the number of
rows that have the same values we will
see it through the syntax
like we will write
select
count
attribute name that will be customer ID
comma
address
from
table name
and group by
accordingly with address
now here the comma will not come yeah
this is the command select count
customer ID comma address from customers
Group by address
when we will execute this command yeah
we will get this table
that would be these are the different
addresses and these are the number of
times yeah number of persons who live in
this address with the count with respect
to customer IDs
now we'll see having close with the help
of an example only
select
count attribute name that will be
customer ID
comma
address
from table name that would be customers
group y
address having
count
customer ID
greater than unit 3 review
semicolon and then we will execute this
command
and you can see
the output we have got through this
command that is Group by command
close this and when we have added having
closed having count customer ID greater
than three
we just got the customer ID count with
four
now we'll see another command
that is order by
select star from table name that is
customers and we will order this output
by address
semicolon
we have got the output with respect to
the address
the address has been assigned
alphabetically here
so what exactly is mongodb
it is a document oriented nosql database
it was initially released in August 27
2009.
mongodb replaces the concept of rows of
conventional relational data models with
something called documents it offers
developers the flexibility to work with
evolving data models since its document
based mongodb allows embedded documents
arrays and represents complex
hierarchical relationships using a
single record it is also schema free
which means that the keys defined in the
document are not fixed as a result
massive data migrations can be ruled out
but you must be wondering when there's
something like SQL why is nosql or
mongodb used
there are a few reasons why mongodb is
widely used
first up is flexibility
mongodb's notion of documents that can
contain sub-documents nested in complex
hierarchies is really expressive and
flexible
flexible query model a user can
selectively index some part of a
document or a query based on attribute
values regular expressions or ranges
next up is native aggregation native
aggregation allows its users to extract
and transform data from mongodb and
either load them in a new format or
export it from mongodb to other data
sources it makes it extremely compatible
lastly as mentioned earlier the schema
free model now applications get the
power and responsibility to interpret
different properties in different ways
now that you know what mongodb is and
why exactly it's used let's have a look
at the characteristics of mongodb
firstly it's a general purpose database
now mongodb can serve heterogeneous
loads and multiple purposes within an
application
again it has a flexible schema design
document oriented approaches with
non-defined attributes that can be
modified on the Fly is a key contrast
between mongodb and any other relational
database
next up is scalability and load
balancing it's built to scale both
vertically but most importantly
horizontally using sharding an architect
can share load between different
instances and Achieve both read and
write scalability
when it comes to load balancing this
happens automatically and transparently
to the user by the short balancer
again we have aggregation framework now
mongodb offers an extract transform and
load framework that eliminates the need
for complex data Pipelines
native replication now data will get
replicated across a replica set without
complicated setup
security features both authentication
and authorization are taken into account
in mongodb
next up is Json now Json is widely used
across the web for front-end and API
communication and as such it's easier
when the database is also compatible
with the same protocol
lastly we have mapreduce now again
mapreduce is an excellent tool to build
data pipelines and mongodb uses
mapreduce readily now let's quickly have
a look at the working of mongodb
data is stored in documents with the
help of key value pairs now the data is
stored in the bson format at the back
end mongodb converts Json data into a
binary format known as bson
mongodb also makes provision for nested
data now all of these documents are
stored in a collection these collections
hold multiple documents and since
mongodb is schema less the documents in
one collection need not be similar now
again these collections are stored in
the entire mongodb database as mentioned
earlier mongodb makes provision for
nested data this makes fetching of data
extremely efficient when compared to
other databases now you must be
wondering where exactly mongodb can be
applied or used so let me help you with
that several areas of Technologies use
mongodb as their dbms currently some of
them are Internet of Things mobile
applications real-time analysis
personalization catalog management and
content management
now all said and done let's look at some
of the companies that use mongodb
currently
companies like Toyota sap AstraZeneca
Adobe where is on Cisco Barclays and
Google among others readily deploy
mongodb as their database management
system in this video I'm gonna help you
install and set up mongodb on your
Windows system
you will have to navigate to the
official mongodb website
and here you can see
software
so go ahead and click on community
server under software
and you can see that the current version
is 4.4.4 and the platform is Windows and
make sure that the package is MSI all
right now go ahead and press download
so this could take a while
all right so once it's downloaded
go ahead and install it
now since it's already installed on my
system uh the installation process will
be different but you just need to follow
the steps there and finally install it
so once you're done with the
installation you can go to your C drive
and here you can click on program files
and you can see that mongodb is
installed and inside of it you have the
server folder and then you have the 4.4
folder and then you have the bin folder
right so here you have the application
that is your and the mongod
applications both are executable files
now the mongod file or the application
is the daemin process now this is the
background process that makes sure you
retrieve the data from the database
access the data so it does all the
background tasks so after the
installation now you need to create a
path to this file by doing this you
don't have to always go to the bin
folder and then execute the file you can
directly execute the file on your
command prompt right so for that let's
just
go to our environment variables
but before that let's just uh
copy this path
right
and here under the user variable section
click on path and say edit
and go ahead and just paste it right
I've already pasted mine so just go
ahead and paste it and click on OK
and
say okay
right so now you've created the path
successfully now let's head to our
Command Prompt and run the file so
here you can just directly type
since the path has already been created
so just go ahead and say
[Music]
and here you can see that your
server has been generated
and with this you know that your in
mongodb has been successfully installed
and your server is up and running right
so just for confirmation let's see if
there are any databases and how much
space they've occupied so you can right
now just type show DBS
and when you click on it it says admin
config and localhost and all of it is
zero so with that you have successfully
installed mongodb on your system and
it's up and running
all right in this particular tutorial we
will be learning what mongodb is all
about and their advantages and some
practical demonstrations so let's get
started now
so here in mogodb we would like to
discuss about what is the mobile DB so
as we know the mongodb is known to be
called a traditional
document based database okay which
stores the data in a document
okay nosql means it doesn't say like no
to SQL instead it says not only SQL that
means it is not only SQL but it is
supporting the other approaches too
okay so the document based when you talk
about it actually represents the typical
hierarchical relationship using the
single records that means how the
records are related with each other so
that's how exactly it represents and it
is a pure schema free environment so
that you really do not need to have
schema before you go and develop this
program so it is a pure schemerless
environment due to that it is giving you
far more better flexibility when you
talk about completely unorganized
environment
so what is nosql so the huge idea about
a nosql so it is completely into the
non-relational database like tradition
if you see any non-relational database
you talk about a typical nosql
it's purely into the document base here
no SQL does not use any tables like in
rows and columns a traditional rdpps
approach if you see there they are using
a complete table structure like they
talk about columns they talk about rows
and are all about
so here in nosql it stores the
relationship data in the documents so
the different type of nosql databases
are available like you talk about called
document based you talk about key value
base you talk about white column based
and glass based different options are
available for the nosql but the one
which we are using it momodb it is a
purely document based database
now here we would like to go ahead with
some demonstrations like talking about
like how mongodb installation works and
the other aspects
okay everyone so now we're going to
start working on the first option called
mongodb installation
[Music]
okay see mongodb installation is very
simple if you open a website and go for
this website name called
mongodb download
download you're gonna see the official
website called mongodb Community
download is available
when you click here
so you can see it is taking the current
version to 4.4.6
Mac OS and by default detected my
platform however you can select depends
on which platform you have it and after
that you will be clicking on this
download
okay so it will get ready for if you are
from Windows
I would say in this Windows you can
select appropriate option like two
options are available you can talk about
MSI or talk about zip my recommendation
is you can stick to the zip power
portion because it won't start any
mongodb Services behind the scene
that is really helpful because you
really do not want more videos to be
there running unnecessary even if it is
not required my situation is to stick to
the zip file so here once the mongodb is
there so you will be seeing that two
files available inside of mongodb folder
inside the bin so once you download the
zip you will find two different type of
files are available let me mention those
so inside the bin folder you will see
two files one is called mongod
okay the other file which is available
called Momo
T is to basically start a mongod server
and the Mobile T Mobile is actually the
client which will connect with the
bombodi
clear so if you are in
Windows environment so once your Insight
is bin folder of your zip file you will
get the mongodb so you have to double
click on this it will start a new
command prompt
so you do not need to do anything
further just minimize this command
prompt and go inside the bin folder
again and click on the another binary
file called so to get start as a
client
okay since I'm using the MacBook here
the concept is little different about
how mongodb can be used
okay so this is just a basic way of how
the move is being used into your code
okay everyone so now as we are in the
Macbook so here to start mode we have a
very special way to start with so here
I'll start with my terminal and here I
would like to paste on a very simple
command to start my mongodb database
that is called mongod
and after that you have to say hyphen
iPhone DB path it is a place where your
database will be starting and one more
important thing I forgot to mention like
memory would not start automatically
inside your
Windows machine unless inside your C
drive you have to create a new folder
name called data and under this you have
to create a new fold in equal DB because
automatically when the memory starts it
looks inside the C drive data inside a
DB folder there your all records will
get stored so do not forget whenever
you're trying to use the mongod so you
must make have you must have this
particular fold structure in place in
your local machine otherwise this is not
going to start every time I restart your
mongod without this
location it automatically terminates So
to avoid those make sure that you have
this data DB folder ready with you
however you can also change the location
of this particular folder structure for
which we will discuss it little later on
but as of now we can see I'm giving my
location that is called hyphen iPhone DB
path slash data DB I hit enter you can
see now my mobile DB is starting now and
since it's stuck so I have to start the
new terminal now
so here I open the another tab
and type
and I'm going to type more now you can
see it is now connected with my mongodb
and now it is ready
that's the first thing you need to
remember
okay now to check
which other databases are available to
you so you can just type show DBS
so it will show you the number of
databases which are already there inside
your existing
newly installed mongodb
but you can go back and create new
database too here you can see some
databases are already present however
you go back and create the new databases
into your system
and to create this database
be a very simple option available here
name call
use
simply DB
if I say use simplydb it automatically
creates this database and take you
inside let's see now you can see you say
you simply DB it automatically creates
though it is not there but automatically
takes you in while creating those
okay so that means your current database
name for simply DB so if you are not
sure which database you are in we can
just type DBS
or DB
and it will show you that your current
database is simply DB
that's it so your database is set and we
are all good to go ahead with our next
level development
hello everybody and welcome back in a
previous videos you have seen like how
to create a database and how to identify
whether my database is there or not so
if you remember previously we have
created our database using use keyword
so if I just see my databases which we
have created is last time so how we can
check this out we can say
show
space DBS
okay so you can see we have a got
database list but we do not have any
database which we have created last time
is registered here the quite surprising
because when we have created our
database it should be listed here but it
is not let's do one more time I'm saying
use
uh asset DB
and I'm saying switch to sldb now when I
say once again show DBS
so I still don't see my database is
listed here there is a reason the reason
is according to the momodb rule unless
we have minimum one
record or collection is stored inside my
mongodb it really can't show in the list
now I want to tell you what a few
important things
now
here when we talk about called mongodb
in this mongodb compared to the
relational database here the table which
is actually in rdbms it is called here
it is called
collection
okay
DB is still called DB here
okay that means the database will be
still called database but row what you
use this word in a traditional rdbm is
here it is known as code document
if you remember I told you like it is a
document based database so here every
single record what you try to insert it
is not called
a typical row it is instead called a
document so every table is called
collection and every single row it is
called
document that's what exactly the
difference is
okay
now here once it is ready we will go
ahead and talk about our next feature
now
well we have to basically go and create
a new collection okay so what you can
say DB Dot
create
collection and here I can pass my
collection name I can say
demo
collection so once it is done I can see
it is collection is created in typical
language I can say the table is created
and now when I try to see same show DBS
I can see my database is now listed
okay that's how exactly it works so the
very simplest way of how we use in my
code
well in our previous examples we have
seen like how we can create a collection
and we can give the name and I can see
the details are listed when I say show
DBS but there's a again another
alternative option a variable where you
can just do that without even saying DB
dot create collection
well
if I want to create a collection I
really don't need this particular
functionality called create collection I
can directly use this statement name
called DB Dot
DB dot SL
udent
dot insert and here we would like to add
the property like a name and here we can
say
admin
now what is that meaning is when you say
DB dot SL student.insert
and I hit enter you can see this
uninserted one and surprisingly when you
try to say
press enter you will see this SL student
is not a collection which we have
created earlier
so what this line does this line not
only create the collection for you but
also add a record inside with this
property called name because that is a
mongodb and mongodb is always following
the Json based structure and due to that
it goes with the key and value pairs
so DB is a predefined keyword SL student
is a collection name insert is a command
through which you are trying to insert
the record
now to check how many collections are
there
okay so we have one property call show
collections when I say show collections
I can list down those number of
collections or also I can set tables in
a typical rdbms language which are there
added in my system
so as a student in which I can see the
record is inserted so if I want to
confirm I can simply say
DB Dot SL
udent DOT fine find is a function
through which I can list out those
number of Records which are added I say
file and you can see that the records
are received at the same time when I say
DB dot the name call Demo collection
okay
db.democollection dot find
I'll find no record reason because this
collection was created but there was no
record which was inserted in
but you will see when I
write this command called SL student dot
insert it not only create a new
collection for me but also insert the
record into my table also called a
collection
that's where exactly it is giving you
the advantage when you want the
collections to be created along with the
data this is the way how you can really
do this
clear but
whenever you talk about DB dot create
collection many people always think
about what is the significance of having
this db.create collection
look DB dot create collection is having
its own significance we never recommend
this technique
okay to create a collection because when
you create a collection you always bring
some restrictions some terminology which
missed out whenever you talk about this
line
so having this DB dot create collection
you can also offer some
additional capping which is not possible
when you use TP Dot
collection input resistor so you might
be thinking what those cappings you're
talking about let me try to brief you
when I say DB Dot
create
collection and here we are providing the
first name call support student
okay when I say student
so after this student additional
parameters what we can pass is this when
I say
capped colon
true
what we say cap coolant true so you are
enabling the capping after that the next
parameter I'm gonna pass that is known
is called size
in this size we are providing the size
suppose I'm saying 5 2
4 and also we are saying two double
eight zero that is the size of 5 MB and
here we are giving call Max colon
five
what exactly that meaning is see the
meaning is very simple whenever we try
to bring this create collection option
so capping true means you are enabling
the capping so what does that meaning is
it is trying to say in this particular
collection name called student
maximum number of documents
can be either 5 or less than five
clear and the collective size of
documents cannot be increased to more
than 5 MB that means you're trying to
say either by adding the total number of
five records the collective size of five
document will reach to 5 MB okay or else
the maximum number of five documents can
be is stored so whichever fills earlier
you may have a total number of four
documents which are pretty heavy and
they
reach to the size 5 MB and beyond that
the next document won't be added or else
you can have the five documents which
has not yet even reached so any option
will help you to achieve this
so that's where exactly you can offer
the capping but this is only possible
when the user is trying to say DB dot
create collection this option is not
possible when you're trying to use this
so that's the benefit of having this DB
dot create collection and this is what
we always recommend
well now we would like to talk about our
next feature here inside the same
mongodb so we now know how to create a
collection how to create a database and
how to switch from one database to the
other database
now we will tell you like how to insert
a document so far we have already seen
how to insert a document inside a
mongodb now we would like to also show
you how we can insert the documents
using multiple techniques
so remember one thing
MoGo TV comes with two different type of
documents
one is called relational document and
second is called embedded document
mostly while working with mongodb we
always recommend you to use embedded
documents because that helps you to
scale up your application without any
hurdle
okay the embedded documents means what
that means the
I would say the parent record as well as
the child records both stores in the
same location
fine so how exactly that is let's take a
look about this example
here we would like to insert some
records by saying DB Dot
student I do not have a student
collection or I'm just telling you DP
dot student
Dot
insert
here we would like to add
some records what I'm trying to say the
registration number
registration number I'm just saying
uh one two three four you can give
anything now the next one we will talk
about called name
this name we can say
student one
followed by the next one I'm talking
about which course the student has
registered so we can say
course inside this course we would like
to say the course name let's say
course name we are given the course name
called
MCA
okay followed by another property called
duration
okay I'm giving this duration
is called three
years like that
after that
this curly braces is closing that means
see the idea is like you see the course
is an embedded document because from
course you have about few more
properties like in course name and
duration
I am closing this and starting the
another property and that is called
address
okay
so let me remove from here and from
address and address we can say one more
clearly basis and inside this address we
can say City
I'm giving the name called what
Bangalore
the another one we are using that is
called state
[Music]
um
let me remove this state
colon
ke
okay and the third property we're using
that is known is called country
here is saying IE what is called India
so it is closing here
okay and it is closing here so the inner
document and how to document both are
closed hit enter and now you can see the
records are inserted one thing you might
notice
the course
and the address these two are embedded
documents and they do not have any
primary key of its own instead the
course and address both are directly
dependent on
the student object
or the student database so
I will say student have the registration
number
fine
and the primary key so the primary key
will be associated with the most outer
document and the inner documents are
directly
associated associated with them and now
when I try to say DB Dot
student
dot find
you can see now the records are
fetched
I can understand many of you are
thinking every time
while adding the record we do not add
any object ID
and here you might have observed and
there also your option then what exactly
that ID is now let me brief you this ID
is nothing but a unique primary key your
mongodb has offered you
that means mongodb says whichever data
you are inserting it so by default with
every single document
mogodb will associate this by default
property called underscore ID which you
can't even ignore
however you can override I haven't
provided any
underscore ID is a property because this
is a predefined property associated with
every single mongodb document if you
want to override it you can override
from this value to any value because if
you do not pass any value
this value will be automatically
provided that is a typical hexadecimal
value however if you want to override it
you can overwrite the value of
underscore ID but you can't change the
key name let's try with some
another record so same record if I try
to add
School
I'm using call
student2 and here I'm saying one two
three four five here if I want to
override it I can just say underscore
ID
colon I can get the value called what
one zero one
this you need to remember for I'm
overriding this value with 1 0 1 now
adding it now records are added now let
me call find now you see this time the
records when I fetched so in this record
the first record contains a default
underscore ID in the second record it is
the one which I have provided
and remember one thing in mongodb you
really can't offer any property other
than underscore ID as a primary key
here there is no concept of having the
cons like a composite key which you used
to do in Tradition
rdbms here you have only underscore ID
and this is the only property which you
can override it else by default the new
value will be given to you so this is
the first way of how the insert document
has been done we'll be telling you the
another ways where the other documents
are also added Okay so
in the previous examples you have seen
like how we can add the records but I
also tell you there is another
alternative options are available if you
want to insert the records in a bulk
that option is also possible in mongodb
how we can do let's try to understand
here
here we would like to use one very
simple concept for one
my
EMP equal to now starting with
a typical object like this and after
that I mean adding this and within this
I'm adding the first property called EMP
ID
foreign one
after this okay now you can see it is
not understanding because that is the
challenge when we talk about call uh you
know the logical part
because you go with multiple lines it is
not supporting however you have to
follow the same lines now
empid1 and we just give the second
property called EMP name
so
amp ID I just
remove this I just say EMP ID and I say
amp
Name colon
okay adding it here
so
first record here again I'm adding
another one it is called
amp ID column two
okay and now
colon
manager
okay again
colon 3
and
colon
Cuba
added
okay and this curly process is closing
after this
your square bracket is also closing and
once it is done you come down and say DB
Dot
new amp
dot insert
okay and here you pass the name of the
object called my AFB
and you can see now it is telling you n
inserted three that is known as called
work insert where you are inserting
multiple records in a single shot
see how easy it is for you
okay now you simply use DB dot The
Collection name is what your new EMP
dot find
and you can see now all three records
are inserted with its default object ID
okay so that is a really nice idea to
have
the ID to be provided
okay remember this statement
so you understood finally how we can
add the records in a bulk going forward
we will also talk about which is related
to your update as well as delete in your
upcoming demos okay but here that is the
first thing which you realize it how we
can perform those kind of operations in
very very simple and straightforward
manner okay everyone so now we have got
three records with us and in case if I
am planning to perform update on any of
my records how will I do this now so we
have a predefined functions a variable
name called update function let's see
how this update function can really work
so we use this statement name called DB
dot what is my collection name which is
known as call a new EMP new EMP
okay dot
update
okay so what I will do I will say DB dot
new EMP Dot
update you
okay now when we talk about called
update we have a
statement available
okay what is that that is called
EMP ID we call EMP name so we say
wherever the EMP ID is this I want to
change what the name how can I do this
now very simple uh
to perform this what I would like to do
now I want to basically add few more
records to give you some more better
idea
uh you can see now here we have a call
admin ID name so I just do one thing I
just change the IDS
one two three I just say four
isf5
ss6
okay and I
call this
again the three records are inserted now
let me try to call find now we have
total number of
six records are available where
admin is repeated manager is repeated QA
is repeated
now let me try to update the record
okay now I want to say DB Dot
new EMP
Dot
update here I would like to perform the
property like in what
uh
name as a EMP name
amp Name colon if I say admin
okay
so I just close that and I use another
curly braces with dollar
set means you want to set the new value
here we are giving
EMP name
okay what I want to do I say variable
the name is admin change to what
admin new that name I want to change it
close this close this
and run
now you can see it is saying n match to
one
and the record fields are updated like
this let me check
well here I will see uh the value called
admin new is updated but I have one more
admin called admin it is not changed and
there is something which you need to
notice
what you need to notice is notice is
like when you try to perform update so
what mongodb does it starts from the top
find the first record
change the value or modify the value and
come out from the loop it doesn't carry
forward its search process for the next
level of results and there is something
which is
I really want to do that so in case if
you are planning to change those values
multiple times so what you need to do
let's take a look here in the similar
example here we have a call name admin
second property we will call manager
let's try to say
managers are repeated twice we just want
to change to
foreign
manager and I want to update multiple
values what I will do here
I will put comma and say
multi colon should
okay same multicolon true that you want
to say hey I want to update multiple
search or multiple repetitions hit enter
this time you can say it is saying and
match to and modify 2 that means two
records found and two records are
modified let's check
there we go we have got new manager is
updated in both the location
that's something which is really awesome
because this is how you try to perform
the multiple changes
well in our previous examples you see
like how we can perform the update part
but we have a one more beautiful feature
available inside the mongodb and that is
called how exactly we can perform absurd
clear let's talk about absurd upset is a
combinations of update and insert let me
try to show you one magic here
here
when we talk about called update part
you see now
here we are trying to say uh
this point
yeah you see about multi-true we have
used
now here
this multi-true
is we're trying to update but let's talk
about something called manager 2.
enter now you can see it is saying no
records formed
clear now no records formed
but there's a concept available name
called absurd absurd means if I try to
perform absurd techniques if the records
are not available it'll insert the
record
I want to show you one simple example
now here we are using multi Troop
okay so as I can see we're using
something called name and we're
performing this update part so in this
update part we are using this dollar set
new manager so here rather than using
multi-truth
piercing
obstruction
when I say abstract rules what happened
now they say n matched 0 and up inserted
2 and modified with ID this that means
when I try to call this find function
you will be seeing now we have a god
the another record has been added are we
clear now
as a new record
so Absa does what upset says like if the
records are found
I will update it if it is not I will
insert it that means if I try to call
the same thing manager 2
fine it is added as a new manager now if
I just try to say
uh
not manager 2 I will call QA
QA and here we're saying EMP equal to
new
underscore QA
and now you can see it is saying
unmatched one and I've sorted 0 and
modified one so it is clearly telling
you like hey I did not find any uh
inserted part but yes I matched one
record I found one record and the one
record is updated now that is very very
beneficial feature when you really want
to perform absurd so that is a
update plus insert
very important feature that depends on
the requirement if you want to add you
can certainly add this so the way we
have tried to add this upserted part we
can also try to perform the delete part
also
okay so mongodb also helps you to
perform the delete part and how you'll
be trying to add it now let's try to
understand here in my code if I were to
perform any delete path I have this
statement name called DB
Dot the option we are using it that is
also collection name EMP
a new EMP sorry
dot we have option you will remove
then this remove we would like to offer
the property
okay and what we're talking about now
here let's try to add the ID here or the
name which you would like to import so I
want to say like EMP name admin new so
we just say
B name
okay
and then
scoreboard
admin name
okay EMP name admin name when I say
remove
we can see it is record removing the
first record
so you can see now the records are
removed
fine because there is only one admin
name is available
okay now in a similar way if I try to
remove
the property call a new underscore
manager new underscore
management hit enter now you can see the
three records are removed so it's not
like update which removes only one sorry
update only one record it can also
eliminate more than one records at the
same time
that's the benefit of remove so now you
can see we have already implemented some
records
as I seen earlier like we have performed
the delete part now
now when I try to say DB
Dot
new EMP dot find
three records are available with me
three four and six
now when it comes to C in third part we
have seen update part we have seen
delete part we have seen now it's time
to basically fetch the records
so find function we've already seen But
in find function we also have some
conditions so called queries so in case
if you want to limit the number of
Records into your application you can
also do that let's see DB
Dot
uh new EMP
Dot
find
clear now so in find you can also
pick up the specific records too like
when I'm saying dot find and here we can
just say name
colon
admin
sorry
here to put curly braces
it says there is no record with the name
called admin
because it is the EMP name not a name so
let me change back to
now I can say it finds one record so
like that you can also apply a condition
okay enter your code now in a similar
line if you really don't want to offer
any condition
okay but you want to limit the number of
Records to be shown so you have this
function available name call
limit
to two means only two records now I can
see though I have three records but it
is only showing me two records because I
have limit those number of Records into
my code
also we can perform sorting in case if
you want to perform the Sorting in the
sending and descending order that also
you can also do so here rather than
saying limit
with this put this option name called
sort and in this sort on which property
you want to sort it that also you can
mention so we can just say PMP name
okay and using ascending button or
descending order so you can just say
um minus one well you got descending
order
hit
now you can see it is showing in a
descending order now if I just say
minus 1 if you just say 1 what is
showing you in an ascending order so you
can pick up the specific property we
have on which you can tell it should be
either on descending order or ascending
order so that option really works very
fine
okay
so that's like how you can perform the
queries but remember one thing you can
also
search the records based on the embedded
columns too because if you see in a
previous records we have
some records added okay that is uh let
me try to say show
collections
our call SL student
and student
okay DB Dot
Dot
find
okay
you can see we have records which are
embedded records now if you want to
search the records based on their
embedded properties like I am talking
about address this is one property name
called City
fine so if you would like to pick up
those records these are also possible
so how you can do this very simple so
you say TV DOT
student
Dot
find
okay so inside this file you can provide
the specific properties like my
outermost property name is called what
address so we are using this option
called
address dot dot City
so we say City
are we clear colon I'm giving the city
name called what Bangalore
okay let me close this
and that's it
okay
so we have to start passing
another curly places here hit enter and
you can see now I find two records
because both the records belong to what
Bangalore so I'm getting this
City Bangalore with me
that's really awesome like you can also
pass the city accordingly
a part of that we also have
the other details also okay in which you
can
have the conditions based on less than
greater than or whatever values you
would like to make it is available and
possible
okay so that's how the conditions are
satisfied
so suppose if you would like to pick the
users
I'll be clear where the range which you
would like to consider so those are also
possible like you can see we have this
property name called what amp ID3 and 6.
I just want to pick up only those
records whose ID is greater than what
two so what I can say DB dot new EMP
okay dot find
and inside this file we can say
the property okay so what's property
we're using empid we are saying EMP ID
here colon here we'll be using dollar GT
GC stands for what greater than colon we
are giving the value called what one
why close this
run you can see you have received three
records three four and six
in case if I just look forward for
higher than 5
you will see only one record so greater
than
let's call GT
okay
same option if I just say LT
you can see we have found
two records so less than greater than
okay so that's how exactly you offer it
okay and also you can provide the
condition so-called limit as I can say
find EMP ID the way we provide it so
here I will not use
less than
okay instead I'll be providing another
property let me show you what
so here in empid whatever we have taken
so let me try to take the property call
file and here we are providing EMP
ID and then
we're using other curly braces and we're
using Dollar in is very important
property Dollar in Colon here you
provide the details I'm saying uh inside
so the properties three four six we are
saying
three
comma 6.
close this
and you can see we got two records
which matched with three and six that's
the benefit of having
this okay everyone so in our previous
example we have already seen lot many
activities this time we are trying to
offer you something very interesting
feature and that is known is called
working with indexing see momodb is one
of the most popular tool
and one of the reason why it is very
popular because it is having the
facility of having indexing now what
exactly the index does so friends main
job of having this index is to basically
give you the concept of like how uh one
particular uh document which is huge
document in case if you would like to
perform any sort of indexing inside this
how you will be applying this
so to apply indexing into my code let's
try to understand why index is really
required without indexing and with
indexing how you'll be making a
difference into the code
so to make it happen we would like to
insert some records
to confirm
okay
so what I will do is in Step number one
previous records if I see I have a got
four six three four one depends on what
earlier records we had it so we had a
call
new EMP
so DB dot new EMP
dot find
so we have total number of three records
are available so it's okay we can have
this three requires with me now let me
try to apply indexing without indexing
if I want to find a result what outcome
I'm gonna receive so to know about how
much time it gonna be taking if if I
have a got large number of records with
me I'll be using this statement name
called DB
dot the name is called New EMP
Dot
explain and here I will be using one
predefined functionality called
execution starts
execution starts
okay now here after the execution starts
you'll be using Dot
find we'll be using the first property
here
okay and
what user would like to find it that you
need to basically offer it so we are
giving the name called EMP name
colon putting the name call
uh QA
okay let's close
okay now when I pressed hit enter
execution stats is a predefined
functionalities which will tell me
when the query was executed what exactly
the query plan was hit enter and now you
can see a lot of details
are available with me
like you can see
parse query winning plan and everything
one thing you need to Remember by
default
here when I try to run it says and
return one
Advance or need time
total everything it is showing me but
one important thing which you will see
here
is
total number of documents scanned
food is telling me total number of
document examined is 3.
clear now
and return one that means one result is
returned and the total number of
documents examines three in order to
find this record
just imagine a use case here
when I say total number of documents
examine 3 in case if I ever got millions
of records with me that means to search
the record it will examine all the
Millions number of Records to search the
result which certainly gonna be taking
huge amount of time
and that's where exactly when you try to
search the record
fine when you have no indexing is
available
okay so you need to understand one
important thing is
by default index is applied on your
underscore ID DB Dot
new EMP
um
yeah DB dot newmp dot
when I say db.new EMP dot get index is a
predefined function it tells me like hey
by default index is applied or
underscore ID
that's the fact because by default index
is applied on underscore ID not on the
other properties
so I need to identify which of the
properties are required to be get
indexes mongodb advantages it is
supporting multi-column indexes and
that's what exactly we would like to see
so let's see in our next demo now we
will try to apply indexing on our own
property
okay so to apply the index what we need
to do we have to say DB
Dot
certainly we will be talking about
called collection name call
new EMP
Dot
create index
here you have to pass two things number
one
on which property you would like to
apply
okay and it has to be ascending or
defending so I am trying to apply on
EMP
and I want the index to be applied on
ascending order
okay so here
colon one
hit enter you can see now it is telling
me like uh number of indexes before 1
and number of indexes after two that
means earlier index was available only
on one particular property now it is
applied on two properties
if you want you can check now you can
see there's another property is added
called EMP underscore
now if I try to execute a similar query
which I executed earlier
give it now you'll be seeing there's a
different statistics altogether
here if I see
in my code
See it'll tell you total document
examined one see now earlier the number
of document examine were three but since
this index is applied notice telling me
the total number of document examined is
one so performance is certainly improved
so to search your document it won't be
searching the complete
collections
okay rather it will search what only
that particular column in which it is
actually applied for so that's the
benefit in fact I would say when you
will be using these kind of indexes into
your code
okay so hope we all are clear and
understood about this concept so let's
go ahead and get this implemented into
our system
well this is the first way of how the
index can be applied so you can also
apply index on multiple properties
clear so that we will show you one by
one how it is
okay everybody so we have already seen
in our previous example how we have
applied indexes in our existing mongodb
application
so it is also a possibilities where we
want to also apply the index on other
number of properties too as you can see
in our existing database
okay an existing collection my
collection name is new amp which
contains two different properties one is
called EMP ID and second called EMP name
just now we have applied index on our
EMP name but in case if I want to apply
index on EMP ID I'll be using the same
technique okay let's try to apply index
on the same so first of all get indexes
I'm having this index applied on two
different property now we would like to
say DB
Dot create
index and here in this DB dot create
index we can just
I will say DB dot collection name so our
collection name is called New EMP new
EMP
dot create index first parameter is
certainly the name of which property we
are applying so here we are saying EMP
ID
and in this EMP ID we will just offer it
has to be ascending or descending let me
decide descending order
so we are saying
-1
okay now let's press enter and check the
status okay now you can see earlier
indexes which we have created that was
two and now it turns to three so it is
very clear that index is improving now
let's check this out
uh DB Dot
newmp.getindexes now we have a total
number of three indexes are available
so you can apply index of n number of
columns if you want
okay at the same time the way we have
created the index in case if I want to
drop an index so we can also drop so
what we can do DB dot new EMP
dot drop index
drop
index
and in this drop index we have to
provide
which particular index we would like to
draw
remember this point in case if you're
planning to drop any sort of index so
you need to provide which index so you
should have that particular index name
okay so here we are providing my index
name so it should not be uh I would say
the traditional name called EMP ID no it
has an EMP ID
underscore minus 1 or
so this should be the name I'm saying
EMP
in case if you try this you see it is
saying index not found with the EMP name
because internally it maintains with
this name
let's try this out we say EMP name
underscore one let's try
and now you can see new index was three
okay one
okay
now you can see we have a call empid and
underscore ID
so now we have
only two indexes left there is no EMP
name anymore this is how exactly you can
drop the indexes
so it is very simple and straightforward
way of how in mongodb you can perform
your activities hello everybody and
welcome back
in a previous examples of mobile DB you
might have considered
we have used lot many operations in our
last video we have seen how to utilize
indexing into our code now in our next
journey of our mongodb we will see how
aggregation Works see in mogodb
aggregation plays a vital role and
aggregation comes with so many handy
functions with mongodb which will help
you to perform
and to apply some very simple code
Snippets into your ongoing
I would say the requirement which can
make your query so much seamless now we
will see how this aggregation really
works and to work on an aggregation we
have taken some default database name
called aggregate DB and here we have a
call student as a by default collection
in which we have some set of records are
already added
now if I just want to apply aggregation
now I would like to tell you about what
exactly the aggregation is see ideally
when you talk about call aggregation
okay so aggregation is nothing but a
call aggregate like rdbms if you see we
have to call aggregation there see the
Unix command like you talk about shell
pipeline means the possibility to
execute an operation on some input and
use that output as an input for the next
command
that means the output of one particular
execution becomes an input for others so
mongodb also supports same kind of
concept in aggregation framework there's
so many type of functionalities are
available which we will see one by one
into our next code
okay now here we want to confirm about a
few important things now here let me try
to bring some of the important
well-known
I would say the functionalities of our
aggregation framework first we use the
terminal called dollar project
the project is basically designed for
select
specific
specific fields Donald project is
designed to select what is specific
fields from a collection we used to talk
about called what
dollars match the match is responsible
to filter out the operations
are we clear now it is designed to
filtering out the operations
you talk about dollar group
talk about caller dollar group so it
does the actual aggregation fine we talk
about call Dollar sort
okay it basically sort the document okay
like that there's so many operations are
available which we will see one by one
in our aggregation Behavior now my first
example the one which I want to execute
I have a call student record with me
which contains a student name okay the
section
and the marks and the subject on which
subject the person or the student
disappeared now here my first
requirement is we want to filter
data based on a section A because
students belong to different sections as
you can see now it is they belong to the
different section section A B C D so I
just want to filter the data based on a
section A
okay so for filter out I would like to
use dollar match let's see how it works
so I just would like to filter out only
those students who belong to the section
A
so how we would like to re use it now I
will say DB Dot
student Dot
aggregate and inside this we would like
to use this
square brackets and then curly braces
and then use
dollar
match
with this I would like to use another
curly braces
and I say
section
a
okay and I close this close this close
the square bracket close this
okay so DB dot student dot aggregate
aggregate should be always associate
match is no aggregate functionality
section a hit enter and you can see now
it lists down all those students who
belong to the section 8.
okay very simple and straightforward
example now we would like to use the
second example so we want to find out
all the records where this section is a
and we are using and operator Max is
greater than 80 there are so many
students who have a different marks like
1790 and whatever
so we want to use both the conditions
together so how are you going to be
using this now remember not only the
section A but also marks were greater
than 80. so similar thing we have a call
match
okay after this match we're starting
this curly braces
okay so after this match we would like
to bring and
reset all
and and again colon
again we are starting this call bracket
now
okay we talk about what
section A
number one and after this the first
curly braces we would like to use marks
we say
marks colon and once again
I would like to start curly braces and
here we use
dollar
GT that is called what a greater than
colon
80.
okay all are closed so you see like here
we have got this square bracket in noun
brackets
so
what else is left
so we have a call 80 we are using
another curly braces needs to be closed
here
and then
square bracket
okay and followed by again curly braces
again curly braces
again square bracket again round
brackets
okay
let's see where it is going on
so we're using this DB dot student dot
aggregate we'll use this
yeah square bracket then curly braces
then we use dollar match
okay after the dollar match
we are using another curly braces and we
will call and operator after this and we
have a call
this now square bracket then curly
braces section A
outer section is getting closed we are
using another curly basis marks colon
dollar GT
okay and we are using what
colon
80. after that we are closing this
and using two more curly which is coil
packet in this
okay so this where exactly you can
utilize that so DB dot student dot
Aggregate and like this it will be able
to get it now okay so in a previous
example that was the only missing point
was after this
uh this dollar match we didn't apply
this curly braces
that was only missing point which was
there and now we have applied another
code is giving me this outcome and I
have only one user who's scoring greater
than 80. well that was the first thing
which we have it now
along with this I would like to go ahead
and talk about few more things now I
just would like to bring selective
Fields not all the fields like as you
can see we have a call student name
section marks everything I'm getting it
so I really don't want to bring all the
properties from this document I would
like to selectively take specific
property
so
let's talk about how we can use this so
we'll be using project you remember
about project is responsible to select a
specific record
so I just use this statement name called
DB
Dot
student okay dot
aggregate we are using it now after that
square bracket
then curly braces now we are trying to
say dollar
project
what you would like to use dollar
project and colon we are trying to use
student name
okay colon
okay remember one thing one means I want
to zero means I don't want so whichever
property will be enabling it by giving
the one as a digit that means it is
it is expected to be displayed so I'm
saying one
comma I'm saying section
colon 1 okay and I'm also
looking forward for marks
call it one
that's it so now
you can see now I am once again picking
up only those
like student section and marks now if I
go back and remove some properties like
I only want
student and section you can see I have
only students and sections are used
here if I just use this statement name
call
underscore ID column 0.
now you can see only
the names and sections are visible ID is
not because I really don't want ID by
default ID is shown but if I says 0 that
means the ID will not be visible here so
like that you can select
The Columns or the properties
accordingly that was the one way now the
other thing I would like to use
what if you want to find out the student
name section and marks from student once
again we want to find out the student
name section and marks from the student
collection where the section is a
okay so here it will be the combinations
of match as well as the project
how we can use this let's take a look
towards my implementation
the previous one what we have used here
you remember about we have used this
statement called aggregate match
okay so now we would like to go back and
utilize
after this total match
this is a curly basis I'm giving
section
colon
a
okay section colon a and after this I'll
close this
okay and close this again
I'm opening it up
by using this option call
project dollar
project we are picking up the project
right now and here with this colon
symbol we can use again and say
student name
student Name colon we are using one
comma
section colon 1
and
1.
Max colon 1 and now
closing this
now I can see I got those so the
requirement was
we want to find out the student name
section and marks from student
collection with a section is a so you
are not only using the match
okay but also using what the selective
details like this you can implement it
okay that's where exactly the projection
really works so projection gives you lot
many opportunities which you can utilize
it for your own and also it comes with
lot many predefined functions like in
some AVG and on so let's talk about
those functionalities too
so this is the first thing which we have
seen aggregations are taken place now in
case if you would like to perform the
group like if I want to find out a total
marks
Group by
okay section like each and every section
I would like to confirm the total marks
in every section then how will I
basically do that
so let's try to get this example also
so here
let me try to
go back
and we will not be using match here
because I would like to use a group part
so
foreign
group
okay that is called Group by in rdbm is
how you use it here we use this curly
braces again here we are passing this
underscore ID
okay you have to provide underscore ID
in a group because you cannot skip it
that part you need to be always remember
you really can't skip dollar ID whenever
you're trying to talk about code group
this is a compulsory field you need to
have it after that
I'm using this
section
in this section
we are saying dollar
section
because we would like to make it on a
section basis
after this
closing
and here we are using what
total marks
colon here curly braces
again
uh dollar
sum
okay colon on which we have I want to
use in Mark so I can say dollar
marks
naming convention is very important
because it is a JavaScript so it is a
case sensitive
okay then
and you can see now section wide I'm
able to get all the marks
isn't this an amazing that's where
exactly the aggregations are playing
very important role while retrieving
such kind of Records
so hope you are clear about how we
utilize this together
so in a previous example we got it like
how we are basically taking this marks
in my application fine so we are clear
about how we are picking that up but
what in case if I would like to take a
marks for the specific section
so it is also possible so we'll be using
the same group but only thing is what
will be bringing the match between
because here we are trying to get the
all the section marks but if you would
like to bring it only for the specific
section we know it very well what we
need to do so here
before I talk about called dollar group
we can use one more curly braces here
okay so we can use this option called
dollar match
okay and here we are using this
uh option called section A
sorry
here in dollar match we are giving this
call
section
here we're giving okay
so closing this
closing this
followed by
the other areas like in group which you
want to start now
so you can start with this curly braces
hit enter and you can see now only the
specific section we are able to receive
the records
and that's very simple now
okay so that's where exactly would like
to perform and there's another option
like in case if you would like to
perform at an average suppose if you
want to fetch the count of student in
each section and total marks and average
marks as well is so total marks as well
as the average marks we want to get it
so how are you able to take it now
so it is very simple as you have seen
earlier also into our code how we have
taken call group underscore ID section
talking about section
total marks with the sum we are also
using this after that we can also use
the average
Okay so
this is we have taken group underscore
ID sum so here on which we will start
so when we say sum marks after that we
can just put curly braces
and we can just use count
okay and after this we'll be using this
colon
curly basis and use
dollar
sum
okay colon one
okay and after that I'll put
comma here and we use
average
and insert is average I will use
in curly research we can say dollar AVG
okay colon of what
dollar
marks
very simple
so curly process is closed
okay so total how many three curly
braces will be closed
one square bracket and round brackets
and now you can see you got the average
markings
in each and every section
so just imagine how easy it is for you
to deal with the aggregations so
aggregation seems to be very very simple
approach provided by MoGo TV that really
create a difference of how the
aggregation changes the way how you
react
okay everybody so after going through uh
the idea of like how we can utilize
the concept of or aggregation it's time
to talk about like how
when it works with mogodb mobile DB is
properly known for
I will say for replication that is
called high availability and that
feature comes by default with mongodb
you really don't need to install any
software for this because it is a
built-in feature for the mongodb so when
you download that it comes along with
this so no additional
configuration setup is really required
when it comes to the mongodb part okay
so let's get started and talk about how
mobile DB can offer the replication see
the ID behind the application is what
the idea behind the application is like
you are replicating it
okay
so we talk about course application you
are replicating your data to wear to the
multiple child so here in mongodb we
have one concept available
okay that is known as master
okay and
slaves
okay Master is one and there will be
multiple sleeves okay so these slaves
where your records are actually stored
and this is a master which will be
responsible to replicate the data to all
its Childs when the request comes due to
that in case I have one particular
node fails so automatically the data
will be taken from the other nodes
that's the beauty of having this master
and node slave process so to make this
possible we have a very simple option
available
in mongodb we have one concept like call
momodb Atlas so there we can go and get
our cluster ready so here we start with
the concept name called
DB Atlas
let's search for momodb Atlas and here I
see mogodb Atlas database as a service
see this is a free tool it's the cloud
environment where you really don't need
to install mobile DB in your local
machine it is a cloud-based mongodb
support which is free to use with a
limited amount of space but yes for the
testing purpose it is the best suitable
so I can start with the start free or
else I can say the login here
okay from there onwards I can go ahead
now it is getting ready
foreign
from where you can start working on your
cluster see as I've told you like
initially when you will be working on
this
Mobile TV it will ask you to create a
cluster
initially
okay since I already have a cluster with
me
okay so I really don't need to create it
and as a free tier it will not allow me
to have more than one cluster setup
ready
so if I say create a new cluster
okay and I say by default AWS
okay all right closed on this
notification AWS you can select any
other cloud provider and
8GB Ram Cloud backup custom name you can
see now it is taking me
0.54 per hour reason being because I
already have a cluster with me hence
more than one cluster is not allowed in
a free TI cluster so I have to cancel
this but
you can go and create a cluster the way
it was offered there so if you want to
create you can just go ahead and do
nothing just select by default AWS
select your location okay give the name
of the cluster you want to give anything
you can give it here otherwise let it be
the by default name cluster and say
create cluster it will take a while
minimum two to three minutes depends on
the availability it creates a cluster
for you and your cluster once it is
ready it looks like that
Okay so
here in this application you have to go
back and understand what is there any
questions when I click on cluster zero
you can see now here we have got three
nodes available one is called primary
node which is called Master as I
suggested earlier
and now we have called slaves
automatically when the Clusters are
created inside this mongodb by default
it will be three node cluster where the
one will be the primary in two will be
secondary
based on your package whichever you have
taken it you can increase the number of
nodes later on but as a free I am gonna
get or I will be receiving total number
of three nodes available here
so record whichever will be stored it
will get stored automatically in both
the nodes
secondary nodes and from the primary I
can insert the record and secondaries I
can read the records remember you can't
insert records into the secondary so you
can only insert a record only in your
privacy code secondaries are not allowed
to insert
so this is your replica set okay these
are the nodes which are available to you
so when you click on this primary here
you will see
it is telling you node whatever no data
available no data available
nothing is there because I haven't
stored any records as such
so I just go back to my cluster
so initially I would like to go back and
create few things now okay I would like
to go back and set up few initial things
at a time of creating the cluster
because when a cluster is created
clear now so in that point of time no
setting is configured you have to do few
settings now first setting is you have
to put it and remember the steps First
Step will be your network access so in
network access you have to go and you
have to say add IP address and in this
add IP address you have to select this
option
from which location you would like to
accept
only those IP addresses will be
whitelisted otherwise what you can do
you can see here in my options I have
given 0.0.0 that means all IP addresses
are
acceptable so all IP addresses are used
okay so this you have to enable it
otherwise you won't be able to get
this network access from any third party
locations
next you have to talk about call
database access which is required for
you to create a new user there are
already some new users are created but
it is recommended that you to go and
create a new users here
okay so you can go back and add a new
user so by default it is username and
password is given so you can go back and
create a new user when I say add user
you can give the username as well as the
password as per your own convenience so
new user I'm going to create it I just
know it's called SL okay user
and here we're giving call
admin
one two three so SL user admin123
remember this will be the username and
password I'm saying add user
new user is automatically added as a
user and then one two three
so
once you have provided this network
access database access
next you have to create a new data
so what you need to do when you go back
to your
statement okay network access database
access it will ask you like you want to
create a new database so I just go back
to my project zero
collections
you have to go back and create a new
collection here
now it is retrieving the list of
databases
now you can see there are already some
collections are there amrdb is one of
the database which is there
demo DB is there lot only databases are
there so you can go back and create some
new database and connect through
so if I just create database I already
have a simple learn DB with me user app
is already when collections are created
so creating a database in collection is
very easy if I give you the quick demo I
say create database give the collection
name call SL demo
okay and give the username call
amp
facility employee like say create
no you can see SL demo create it is
there with me so there's no record right
now and once it is there ready so
remember asset demo and employee I'll go
back to my uh
code again project zero and from here I
can say connect
because I want to connect it so to
connect it from because you mongodb is
already there so you want to connect it
through so to connect it through here
very simple option available you can
just click on this
correct option multiple options are
there through share connect your
third party application of the mongodb
compass
so since I already have a shirt
with me so Mac OS I have this Mac OS
with me so we can just use this line
okay so if you have a window you can
select your window since I have this Mac
OS I'm selecting this line but I need to
replace with this
you can see this username
okay and you have to give the username
here I'll I'll selected this I open my
terminal
okay and this is I'm just closing this
I'm opening up
other terminal here
since I want to connect to the mobile
shell now so what I need to do here in
this
I'll just paste that the command which I
have it now
username is
you remember I told you
you call
some users which you have already
created
let's check
here
SL user
I see
Excel user I hit enter it asks me the
password so I've given the password
admin
and now you can see it is connecting
with me to this particular
see
now see it is connecting me to this a
particular replica set you can see in a
logs it is telling you very clearly
okay saying that it is a username 4.2
and you can see it is correcting with
your sharp cluster the cluster which is
created and this is where exactly I have
it with me
so I'm connecting with this environment
so primary is there if I just want to go
back and say
show
collections
so I can go back and create a new
collection here
okay so it's up to you now by default
collection which is your employee so I
can say DB Dot
employee Dot
insert
and now here we can just add
name
okay
now you can see some exception is raised
so
you understand
now you can see the records are added
into my primary cluster so if I just go
back and
go back to my project zero where we have
got
collections
here you will be getting
the
SL demo employee
loading the documents
if it takes time to get this but this is
where exactly you see the records will
be stored
okay so that's where exactly it works
fine for all of you so we have this
record okay so when I say
show collection so we have a call
employee when I say TV DOT
employee Dot
find
so I can see we have got new collection
name called
this is added right now
okay so like this you have got the first
connection established and the records
has been inserted hey everyone my name
is ishan and I welcome you all to this
session in this session we will have a
look at the basics of GitHub before
diving deep into the subject let's first
have a look at a use case
the used case we will consider today is
that the world's largest Sporting Goods
retail brand decathlon
decathlon has 1600 stores spread in 52
countries with around 100 000 employees
the IIT team of GitHub consists of 1000
members that helps decathlon to bring
its Shoppers journey to their devices
so here we will first see the problems
that they faced and then we shall see
how did they sort out that problem
in the beginning decathlon worked on the
data center with the help of a VPN
and using a VPN was a huge challenge in
terms of workflow visibility and
avoiding redundancies so the first
problem is how to maintain workflow
visibility and avoid redundancies
then since there are so many stores
located at so many different places
hiring of developers seem to be a
difficult task as a physical workplace
was always needed so the second problem
is how would they hire developers now
let's see how did decathlon solve these
two problems one after the other
in the first case the entire decathlon
shifted from any other remote repository
to GitHub
GitHub turned out to be an amazing open
source Community as the code became more
visible across the organization and now
anybody could contribute to it
then let's talk about the second case
for hiring the Developers as we know
GitHub is an open source community so it
helped in collaboration with any
developer all over the world
the potential developers could now
contribute to benefit the global
community
now the question arises what made this
contribution possible
so the major contribution role was
played by the Version Control System
this was just a single case amongst many
others there are many organizations that
have benefited from GitHub now when we
have realized how GitHub has
revolutionized the market let's start
learning more and more about GitHub
as we move forward let's have a look at
what is Version Control System
Version Control System are the software
tools that helps in recording the
changes made to the files by keeping a
track of modifications done to the code
there is one repository and each user
has their own working copy the changes
are committed to the repository which
are possible to be seen by others
the two most important things to make
changes visible are you commit and they
update
as we discussed it is a system that
keeps a track of different versions of a
file and hence a specific version of a
file can be called whenever needed this
makes the collaboration amongst
developers easy and also provides the
members of the team to work on the
latest version of the file
moving forth let's see what is git
now when we have learned Version Control
System the next thing we need to know is
what is git
git is the most commonly used version
control system that helps in tracking
changes made to the files hence we may
have a record of all the changes that
have been made to a file and we can also
revert back to a specific version
git simplifies the process of software
development with the help of easy source
code management
git is not only helpful and popular
among developers but also helps
non-technical people to keep a track of
all the files they have been working on
get further helps in the process of
collaboration and permits changes made
by multiple people to all be merged into
a single source
then git automatically merges the
changes so two people or two different
sources can even work on different parts
of the same file
and later on merge those changes without
losing each other's work this is
specially useful when the projects are
really big and many people are involved
in it
now when we know what is version control
system and basics of Git it is time for
us to jump on the topic what is GitHub
GitHub is a service hosted on the web
where all the projects are stored every
project on GitHub has its own repository
and its unique URL git provides a
graphical interface to store the files
and helps team members to coordinate on
the project from anywhere
GitHub provides several access control
and collaboration features like wikis
and basic task management tools for
every project
let's now have a look at the features of
GitHub
the first feature we will see is easy
project management
GitHub help project managers and
developers to coordinate better on the
project
the work can be easily tracked and
updated which makes sure that the
project is on schedule and as entitled
second feature is increase safety with
packages
the packages on GitHub can be published
as desired they can be published
privately or within a community or can
also be published publicly
the packages can be easily downloaded
from the GitHub to use and reuse them
next feature is the effective team
management
now as all the team members can stay
updated with all that's happening on the
project so this helps them in staying
organized and well coordinated the pull
request and other modification tools
make sure that the team focuses on the
code
moving on the next feature is improved
code writing
with the help of GitHub the quality of
code has significantly increased now
with the help of gitpool command one can
review improve and propose new codes
along with that suggestions or
modifications may be discussed before
changing the original code
the next feature is increased code
safety
GitHub uses code ql which is the
industry's leading semantic code
analysis engine this tends to find risks
in the code which other tools tend to
miss
the last feature we shall see is easy
code hosting as the name suggests the
codes and documentations are hosted in
one place
we also know that there are thousands of
repositories on GitHub so each
repository has their own set of tools to
release and host the code
finally let's have a look at the
competitors of GitHub there are several
competitors in the market here we have
just put the most common ones first is
atlasian bitbucket
then comes bugs followed by
surround SCM and gitlab then we have
buddy and finally followed by Beanstalk
this session we are going to understand
who a full stack developer is what are
his desired skills the amount of money
he makes on an average per year and
finally I'll help you build a resume for
your future endeavors
first let's understand who a full stack
developer is everybody uses social media
applications the main reason we use them
is that they provide excellent user
experience and interface
these apps work pretty seamlessly all
thanks to full stack developers a full
stack developer is associated with
creation of a product from its start to
finish he designs the front tent and the
back end of an application while
ensuring its efficiency reliability and
other crucial features
now that you have a basic knowledge of
what a full stack developer does let's
look at some of the desirable skills of
a full stack developer first up for the
front-end development you should have a
good understanding of HTML and CSS HTML
short of hypertext markup language
governs the appearance of text and
images on the screen
it formats the text as headings
paragraphs or pop-ups
CSS on the other hand is a styling sheet
it helps with beautifying the content on
your screen in the form of font size
colors and spacing
next crucial necessity is Javascript
it is a powerful client-side programming
language mainly used for enhancing user
interaction with the application it
offers several libraries and Frameworks
like react angular View and jQuery you
need to be proficient in one or more of
these tools
next up we have Version Control
a worship control basically records all
the changes made to file over time so
that you can recall them at any point in
time most predominantly used Target and
GitHub
get us a free and open source
distributed Version Control System
designed to handle everything from small
to very large projects with speed and
efficiency
on the other hand GitHub is a repository
that provides a user interface for Git
it provides features like Fork pull and
merge
moving on to back-end skills basic
knowledge of node is essential
notice the hottest JavaScript runtime
environment around right now used by a
ton of applications and libraries if
you're writing applications for the
server node.js you need to be familiar
with the environment
next up is python
python is used for several reasons when
it comes to full stack developers the
most common one being the fact that it
is better readable than other languages
like CEC plus plus or Java
it is easy to learn and does not require
a lot of coding it also comes with many
libraries and Frameworks and has a
thriving Community for Developers
Django is a high-level python framework
that performs actions like
authentication database migration and
URL routing among others finally the
backend skills would require having good
knowledge of ddms some of the commonly
used databases are Cassandra mongodb and
Oracle database you should be able to
update the databases and retrieve
information as and when needed
a full stack developer needs to possess
some basic soft skills as well first up
is creativity the developer must
understand the objectives of the project
and should create a product that engages
the target audience next up we have
strategic planning planning is a
critical phase in any development life
cycle the developer should possess the
aptitude to strategically plan the
design development and implementation
phases this helps streamline the process
next up we have analytical skills as the
name suggests it's crucial to analyze
the information and Link decisions so as
to maximize efficiency now these are
skills that one develops when they are
exposed to but a good sense of
understanding is required
problem solving skills are again crucial
to predict any errors and develop a bug
free application
from the business perspective as well
problem solving skills play a
significant role in ensuring the smooth
conduction of tasks
and finally we have time management
skills the developer must be able to
meet the deadlines while ensuring proper
execution of his tasks
moving on let's look at the full stack
developer's salary
in India the average salary of a full
stack developer is about 5 lakh 90 000
rupees per annum
in the US the average salary of a full
stack developer is around 75 000 US
dollars
now if you wish to make a career as a
full stack developer or wish to look out
for better opportunities a good resume
is key first let's look at a sample
resume for a fresh graduate
first up is personal information mention
your name and contact information
moving on to summary write a few lines
about yourself and skills that you are
proud of make sure you keep the section
brief and to the point next go ahead and
provide the links to your LinkedIn
profile GitHub repository and blogs if
any in the next section mention the
projects you have worked on write a
sentence or two about the objective of
your projects
moving on to internships mention the
name of the company you have interned
for along with your role
responsibilities and the time duration
again ensure that you keep it short and
simple this adds credibility to your
profile
you can also go ahead and mention the
university you're graduating from and
your final graduate score
lastly mention your skills this is an
important section since you will be
judged based on your skills you can
first mention all the technical skills
that you're confident about
mention some soft skills and
extracurricular activities that you
participated in now let's look at a
sample resume for an experienced
developer the personal information
Remains the Same however in summary you
can mention your years of experience and
your designation in the previous company
go ahead and provide the links to your
LinkedIn profile GitHub repositories and
other links you feel worth mentioning
moving on to experience clearly
mentioned the name of your previous
company your tenure and the designation
mention the responsibilities Your Role
came with make sure that you don't over
exaggerate use short powerful words like
developed designed managed and
supervised
mention any awards or recognitions you
have received this adds a lot of
credibility to your resume
you can also provide your academic
information like the name of your
University the year of graduation and
your graduate school
finally talking about skills prioritize
them according to the job requirements
and mention them
in the non-technical skills section you
can mention a few soft skills that you
are proud of if need be you can also
mention a scenario where they came in
handy if you wish to mention some other
Hobbies or activities go ahead and
mention them
having said all this it is vital to not
lie on your resume make sure the
information you provide is accurate and
not misleading
so first of all we will understand how
to add programming projects to a resume
and then we will go through different
types of projects like portfolio project
web scrapping projects API BS projects
games e-commerce Etc we'll go through
each of these projects and understand
why these projects are important so
having Web projects on your resume
whether you are new to coding or a
seasoned programmer emphasizes your
technical skills and experience to
companies while helping you stand out
from the crowd this tutorial will teach
you all you need to know about choosing
and presenting programming projects on
your resume so let's first understand
how to add programming projects to your
resume
so the recruiters and hiring managers
don't have much time to go through the
entire resume so in order to make them
notice the best projects you have worked
on you have to include them in proper
place in the resume you can include
technical projects in your work
experience section so that the hiring
managers can see them when they examine
your resume also if you have the prior
employment experience include your
programming projects in the extra
experience box
you can mention the description of the
projects the Technologies you have used
while creating the project and your
responsibilities and achievements for
the project you must include the most
important technical project you have
worked on and can also use the relevant
resume keywords in your programming
resume listing relevant programming
projects allow you to get passed through
applicants tracking systems so use
proper resume keywords by carefully
reading each job description and
adapting your resume achievements and
experience to meet the particular
qualifications that firms are seeking
for
so this was about how to add the
programming projects in your zoomi now
let's go ahead and have a look at some
projects that we can add in the resume
which will increase your chance of
selection during the recruitment process
so now let's go ahead and have a look at
some projects to add in resuming
so first would be portfolio project so
one of the easiest projects to start
with is a portfolio project it enables
you to demonstrate your abilities and
create a personal website that is as
simple as and as complex as you choose
if you create a personal portfolio that
you can immediately show on the website
it will be easier to deliver and
showcase programming work to recruiters
including portfolio projects on your
resume can be especially valuable if you
apply for a creative field such as
design writing or marketing
in these fields a portfolio can provide
a tangible example of your work
now next project to add in your resume
is
web scripting
companies will be impressed if you
demonstrate your master web scrapping to
scan and capture data from a website
web scrapping is a practice of obtaining
information and content from a website
it is especially prohibited to do this
for publicly unavailable domain
including web scrapping skills on your
resume can be a valuable asset
particularly if you are interested in
careers in data analysis data mining or
software development
web scrapping can be useful tool for
collecting and organizing data from a
variety of sources
python web scrapping projects are
popular among beginners these days our
Channel already includes a python web
scrapping tutorial you can check that
tutorial the link will be added in the
description box
next we have API based project as a web
developer using search inputs is an
important skill to have so consider
adding an API to your list of
programming projects API or application
programming interface which is an
intermediate between software that
allows two apps to interact with one
another
apis provide an easy way to retrieve and
distribute data within and across
companies there are a lot of apis
available on the internet including
Twitter's API Amazon API and various
other apis
creating an API based project allows you
to manipulate data understand client
server architecture and obtain data from
HTTP servers
it is necessary to have basic
programming knowledge to create this
type of project and it will take around
two to three weeks to complete this
project now before moving forward let me
ask you a quick question
according to you what was the main
reason for Twitter to lay off so many
employees do let us know in the comment
section below you can take your time
now coming to the next project that you
must have on your list
games so games are an excellent way to
demonstrate your knowledge of basic
concepts and algorithms including games
on your programming resume may
demonstrate your knowledge of logic data
structures and algorithms a game project
can showcase various skills such as
programming Skills game design skills
graphic design skills and project
management skills not only that using
game engine software such as Unity
Visual Studio or Unreal Engine
you can modify or develop an original
game with unique 3D characters and story
lines overall a game project can be an
excellent addition to your resume
because it showcases various technical
talents in great demand in the gaming
business
it can also be a great opportunity to
demonstrate your creativity and passion
for a game development next project on
our list is chatbot chat Bots are
extensively utilized to save time on the
recurring conversation on corporate
websites smartphones applications and
social media Pages a chatbot is a piece
of software that mimics human
communication or chatter via text or
voice interactions to make one you can
use a popular programming language such
as python Java or PHP
these are significant commercial
projects and the recruiting manager
would like to learn more about you
now coming to the next project which is
an e-commerce project
so the majority of the websites and
application with which we interact are
and e-commerce platforms and e-commerce
websites is one that allows you to buy
things online
some examples of e-commerce website is
Flipkart Amazon zomato
OU big basket growfers Etc
including an e-commerce project on your
resume can be a perfect way to
demonstrate your technical skills and
experience working on a complex project
depending on the specific Rule and
responsibilities an e-commerce project
can showcase a range of skills such as
web development skills ux design skills
project management skills and business
skills also so this was all about
projects to add in the resume if you
have any doubts regarding this video you
can put them in the comment section so
what's your opinion on our list feel
free to let us know if you missed out on
something important now we are heading
towards HTML interview questions
now here are a few questions like what
is an attribute in HTML so you can
consider the attribute are the
properties that can be added into the
HTML tag and that changes the way the
tag behaves or it is displayed
okay so you can see here you have a call
Button
okay so attributes are added right after
the name of the HTML tag so button is an
element form it's not an attribute okay
so what is the mark Union HTML file so
Marquee is something which keep on
rotating okay let's say
for scrolling down the text Page or the
text on the web page Mark is used
sometimes you might have seen when you
want to display some very important
information okay which needs to scroll
at the bottom or else the right after
specific period of time you always use
Marquee it is one of the very very old
element available under the HTML page so
it Scrolls the image top left right
center automatically everywhere so you
always use Marquee tags for rotating it
so the next is what is the semantic in
HTML system semantics are htmls are
nothing but a call another coding style
Okay so
when we talk about a semantics so they
are basically reinforcing the meaning of
the contents like typically you have
seen we are using div and span tag but a
demon span tag really don't make sense
to us as an HTML reviewer unless I go
inside those and get to know about what
they're really doing it so semantics are
nothing but these are the standard tags
are we clear so you can see like here
like bold tag is not useful for the
board statement as well as the italic
tag is useful for what for the italic
tag so instead of we are using strong
and EM tags
are we clear now so this makes more
sense to us
now the next thing is how do you display
a table in an HTML web page so obviously
we have a got table tag and under the
table tag I can or align the complete
layout of my web page
because of table head table body table
row table columns there are multiple
different type of elements which are
available
okay which are the part of table it's
just to basically align the content in a
proper format
what is SVG okay so SVG is basically
known as a kind of a graphic which is
written in a typical XML language the
svgs are the high quality Graphics which
doesn't tear off when you basically grow
and increase or Zoom so normally what
happens if image you talk about
jpeg images after Beyond certain point
the pixel get deteriorated but here in
SVG it never happens so you go to any
level when you want to zoom and you're
gonna get accurate contents at any point
of time
okay so these vector graphics are really
typically 2D based diagrams and give you
the X and Y coordinates in a regular
systems
next how do you separate a section of
text in HTML
to separate a sections of text in HTML
we always use what either br
we also use block code or else we use
what a paragraph tag so BR means anyways
it's separate out to text
and break the current line
paragraph is used to again write a
paragraph of text in the block codes is
used to define the large quotated
sections
okay next is how do you create the
nested web page in HTML so obviously we
have a different type of options that
are available like an iframe
okay you mean to say page within a web
page okay so we can create a page within
a web page with using iframe so this is
a very very common questions we used to
receive at the time of interview
okay the difference between ordered list
and unordered lists uh so audit list
will give you the different ways to
display the data
in German format in numeric digits or
else you can talk about like in
alphabetical order but the unordered
list it completely unordered you don't
get any options like in order list
okay so the audit list start with ol and
unordered list starts with
UL
okay so we have already seen the
difference between order list and
unordered list now it's time to talk
about our another Tapper type of
interview questions which is regards to
your CSS
now
in thesis interview the first question
they always ask you like
how do you add CSS styling in HTML
so we have different ways to include
number one we have a call inline CSS
where we use the element and within that
we try to add a CSS content that is
called inline CSS second is called
external style sheet
okay where you can just
use as a secondary or the you know
external CSS file and just include it
into your existing HTML page okay that
is the additional file which you write
it in a CSS and you include it in HTML
and third is called which is the
internal style sheet which you write it
within your HTML but the only difference
happens when you talk about external it
is reusable across multiple web pages
now the different type of CSS selectors
which are available so we have a
different selectors like a universal
selector which is available where you
use asterisk sign and select all the
elements and offer the common style
second we talk about element type
selector where you have the specific
element name into your mind and you
offer that particular type of selector
ID selector is responsible to select the
particular element within having the
proper ID
class selector which starts with a DOT
class
okay and having the class name we talk
about deciding selector so in deciding
selector you basically try to select all
the elements which are the part of that
okay so you are selecting this container
and under that all the child elements of
the box
okay so we're talking about like in what
of your decision selector we talk about
called child combinator so in this case
you are basically trying to select all
those which is a child of this container
so you are using this greater than
symbol of container.box
okay so selecting all those which is
having the child name called Box
available
then you're talking about a general
sibling selectors
with this printer sign and finally we
talk about like an attribute selector
where you have a proper attribute
available to you
okay so these are known as called a
general CSS selectors
followed by we have our next question
like in what is SAS lesson stylus
friends these are the advanced level of
thesis used in the industry so we talk
about like it what is a SAS which we
talk about like in systatically awesome
style sheet so we also have a similar
type of option like in less and many
more
okay so it says about the SAS saying
that it is a systematically awesome
style sheet it is basically taking the
complete CSS to the next level
so that is a third party website but
once again it is very
awesome
thesis which can offer you the
mathematical functions as well as the
reusability
you talk about less okay so we talk
about linear style sheet where you can
see all statements which starts with at
the rate sign there in SAS every single
variable start with a dollar sign
then you talk about stylus it is also
flexible CSS so it doesn't use at the
rate or dollar for any defining
variables we can just directly use this
with the name okay and use it at any
point of time so these are the three
very popular
new or next Generation CSS
so explain box sizing property like how
you can offer the property for the Box
sizing
so here so box sizing property actually
defines how to basically Define height
and the width of the box which are
calculated
so you talk about a term name called
content box you talk about padding box
and you talk about border box typically
we use three different type of box
content padding and Border box
in a Content box these are a default
width and the height which can apply to
the elements content which are there
under the content box
okay padding box are here you talk about
the dimensions which are added to the
Box elements of the content padding
third which is available called border
box so here the dimensions added to the
content padding and the Border
now what are the different way to hide
the element in the CSS
so we have a different way either we can
use display none
that means whatever is there inside a
Dom it won't be visible to you
second option is visibility hidden that
is another property through which you
can
eliminate the visibility but the thing
is like it is not visible to the user
but this element is added to the Dom and
takes up the space
button display none it doesn't load in a
Dom so somewhere to
when you want to talk about performance
display none is anytime better
and second call position absolute so
this can be made to the appear outside
the screen so three different options
are available
next option what does that important CSS
mean so the important keyword actually
indicates that the highest precedence
and it overrides the Cascade properties
okay so like as you can see here we have
a call paragraph where we have a color
called important and this is one ID name
called thing color called Green so when
I talk about PID equal to what thing so
it automatically try to override
the highest precedence
okay
now what are the CSS Sprite CSS Sprites
is a technique where you can basically
take a
larger image okay
download in a single shot and try to cut
down into the pieces and utilize the way
you always want
okay so if you're using this small small
images
separately
okay so to load those images
independently you would be making
multiple HTTP calls which can be an
overhead so it is good to basically
download this uh lengthy image in a
single shot
clear and utilize them as per your
convenience within your application
so it is used to minimize the loading
time of your webpage by combining
multiple smaller picture into the single
image
okay that's what the CSS bytes are so
which property is used to underline and
strike through and the over line text so
we have this option
textile text type text decoration text
transform okay so the text decoration so
the text decoration is the one which
will be helping you to achieve this okay
everyone so our next example is towards
focus on JavaScript interview questions
now here we have few questions that are
available like what are the various data
types in JavaScript
so JavaScript contains different type of
JavaScript data types like if you think
about
all different types which are there
generally byte short int long
float double character Boolean these are
all different type of
data types are supported inside a
JavaScript
okay now
going ahead what is the Callback in
JavaScript so the Callback means is a
function
okay that is passed with another
function as an argument on an parameter
okay so what is the Callback callback
means don't call me I will call you
clear so the idea is like you are
passing
the function itself is in parameter to
the another function because the
JavaScript is known to be called
non-blocking which never wait for the
code to finish it continues to move on
and due to some reason if your
function it's taking some time to
you know execute so JavaScript won't
wait for that particular function to
finish so you use callback to prevent
such Behavior
okay that's called a JavaScript callback
now what is the difference between
function declaration and function
expression see this is called function
declaration
and you talk about a function expression
function declaration is just to declare
a
separate statement within a main
JavaScript code and
you can be called before the function is
defined
okay it gives you the better readability
where the function expression are always
created inside the expression
okay and it is created when the
execution Point reaches it
are we clear and it is used when there
is a need of for a conditional
Declaration of a particular function
now what do you understand about the
cookies in a JavaScript so it is one of
the very very common question cookies
are the one which is created by the
servers stored in a client side which is
responsible to store all the necessary
client activities so that the browser or
the application give the better
recommendation to the user
okay so it is just a
a small text file which is stored in a
browser itself
okay it want to record something about a
user activity you always put it like
that and you can also Define the expiry
time for the cookies
okay as per your convenience to decide
how long the cookie wants to be there
inside your browser if you do not offer
any time span by default the Google will
get lost immediately the moment the
browser closed
next what are the closures in JavaScript
so closures are the JavaScript is a
feature where the inner function has an
access to Outer functions variables and
the properties
okay so you can consider a closure has a
three scope chains number one it has an
access to its own scope
that is defined within its curly braces
second it has an access to the variable
of the outer function and also has an
access to the global variables
now the closure is a JavaScript features
as I told you like which is has an
access to the outer functions variable
simple example I can give it to you is a
function which is known as inner
function and there is a function defined
on the top as an outer function so it is
having all the functionalities axis of
the outer function inside it
now what are the Imports and export in
JavaScript so import and exports in a
JavaScript is a very very common way how
in Java you use the term name call
import a package but in JavaScript it is
little different unless you export
something you can't import it
okay so if you want to access any of
your files Properties or methods outside
of your file you always use the
statement of Import and Export so here
you can see you have got one property
like an sqrt which you are exporting it
and you have one function which is
called Square this is another function
called
you can say d i AG which you're
exporting it and importing it just the
way you always want so that is how it is
importing and exporting
what is the difference between undefined
Undeclared and null in a JavaScript
see undefined means a variable that is
declared but the value has not been
assigned yet that is called undefined
Undeclared means like it is a null first
of all we talk about null null means it
is an assignment value that we can
assign to any variable that is meant to
contain no value and Undeclared means
the variables are not declared and do
not exist in the program
okay that is called what Undeclared
how to remove the duplication from the
JavaScript array so you basically needs
to use the standard filter methods okay
this is basically responsible to help
you to analyze whether we have some
duplicates available or not
so we'll be using using filter methods
okay so these are basically zones called
array and the current element and the
index of current element and by using
the for Loop it is an empty array is
used for the storing all the repeated
elements
okay so these are known is called a
typical JavaScript discussion which we
have taken place multiple questions are
there which we have already answered
okay everyone so we will go ahead with
the next set of interviews which is
related to your angular
so angular is as popular as I can react
okay so there are some questions which
are usually asked like what are the data
binding okay so the data binding is
actually the process which allows the
application
okay to have some data associated with
your
HTML page
from your typescript classes or the vice
versa
okay so the data binding is the one
through which you bind the data okay so
you can see here it says like angular
uses two-way data binding when the
changes happens in a model it will be
affected in a view and whether changes
happens review it will affect the model
also so it is used to
typically keep the model and view in
sync with each other to have the data
interchange
what is the typescript typescript is a
typical I would say a language which is
used
by angular okay to develop angular
component Services pipes decorators and
multiple things it is a superset of
JavaScript and it supports JavaScript
libraries and apis it is a pure object
oriented in nature uses object-oriented
principles better development time fast
to load and additional features to the
JavaScript for sure
okay what is an aot compilation how it
is different from jit aot stands for
ahead of time compiler which is
converting all angular and HTML and
typescript code into the JavaScript code
during the build phase before the
browser downloads and run the code Okay
so aot
is far more faster and light weighted in
the size just in time compiler is a by
default compiler Okay so
it is a process where the compiling
computer code is the machine code during
the execution of runtime
so this ensures the faster rendering the
browser it also known is called Dynamic
compilation
a request when you want to develop this
aot compiler you always use hyphen
hyphen aot
okay so here you always use jit compiler
because that is a by default compiler
you use when you say NG build
next what are the pipes in angular so
pipes means that they are the decorators
they never change their default value
but just for the representation purpose
they change the values okay to look more
better the way they always want
okay so pipes are ready made or else it
can be customized created angular also
comes with lot many predefined pipes
okay like it comes with the pipe symbol
here okay so you can change the pipes
together it can be provided with some
arguments at a run time with the colon
sign
okay now you pass the input you put the
pipe and get some result
with some decorated outcome now you can
see the pure pipes uses the pure
functions
clear so this pipe doesn't use any
internal State and the output Remains
the Same as long as the parameters pass
to stay the same angular calls the pipe
only when it detects the changes in the
parameters being passed a single
instance of the pure pipe is used
throughout the all components
okay so this is how you see how the
pipes are being used so we have defined
the pipe okay which is the value called
true and fault for the pure and giving
the class by implementing pipe transform
so
you can see here the impure pipes for
the say for every change detection
actually happens in an angular and
impure is called I'll be clear with
regards to the changes in the input
fields
okay they will be calling every time so
multiple pipe instances are created for
the C for these pipes and push pass to
these pipes can be mutable by default
all pipes are pure only if you want to
make it impure you always say like pure
colon true
or
pure colon false
now what are the promising observables
in angular see promises it is a typical
JavaScript object okay it it emits a
single values at a time they execute
immediately after the creation and not
cancelable they are pushed error to the
child promises
okay where the observables are only
executable when subscribed to them they
won't call unless you subscribe to them
using subscribe methods so they help
perform operations like it for each
filter and retrieve and everything when
you unsubscribe this they won't get
called and won't listen anymore
what are the form controls and the form
groups see the form controls and form
groups these are two predefined objects
comes with your
angular
so these all text boxes
from you take the input it may be radio
buttons it may be the drop down it may
be the check boxes are called form
controls
okay so form controls is a class that
enables the validation for every single
input class whichever you are creating
it now so they check the values which
are touched untouched or the dirty
clear now we'll talk about called form
group they are basically forming a group
which under which you have a call
relevant Fields joined together are
called what a form group
okay so form group class represents a
group of controls like you talk about
address contains city state and pin code
these all three can be together called
as a form group
okay so the form group class basically
returned true if all controls are
basically what the valid
okay and they are designed to provide
all the necessary validation errors
what is the eager and what is a lazy
loading okay so eager loading means what
it is a default module loading strategy
followed in an angular
Eco loadings are used before the
application starts
these are typically useful for the small
scale applications
lazy loading however is designed for
dynamic loads of features only on demand
this makes your application far more
faster so in a bigger application we
really don't make easy eager loading
because it hamper the performance and
you want only when the client asks you
want to use lazy loading
what is the String interpolation in
angular see string interpolation is
written under the double curly braces it
is a typically One Way binding where you
get the data from the typescript classes
and display directly over your browser
it denotes with the curly process and it
always display the data comes from the
component to The View well let's go
ahead with the next area that is called
working with react.js interview
questions
now as we know it react.js is as
important as like in other tools which
you've already has seen so what is the
jsx here jsx called JavaScript syntax
extension
okay so this syntax extension to the
JavaScript in react is is in the way
how you express to bind JS and HTML
together to result a j6
content so by using j6 you can write a
stable structure in the same file that
contains the JavaScript code that is
something more Innovative way because of
that react.js is creating a more buzz in
the market
so jsx actually helps making code more
easily to understand and debug and
avoids a lot of boilerplate code okay
inside the Dom structure
now the next thing is what is the
virtual Dom see the virtual Dom is
representing a Dom in a memory okay that
is called virtual Dom so manipulating
the real Dom is much more slower and
costly Affair okay because you need to
repaint the Dom over and over the period
of time when the user changes few things
so
when the state change virtual Dom
changes and only the objects which are
in real Dom
okay
update instead of updating the entire
object so that makes your page to be
load far more faster
okay so in Virtual Dom what happens this
is the real Dom this is a virtual Dom so
the orange color portions which you're
seeing that is basically the changes
which has been made okay these are
called Changed object
okay so virtual Dom is basically compare
it's to the previous state and
understand which area it needs to send
for the updates and avoid the other
areas
okay that's what this virtual Dom really
works
so what are react extension react
extensions are many like you talk about
like in flux it is a third party tool
which is responsible to attach
the State Management feature to talk
about react native which is responsible
to develop the hybrid mobile
applications
in JavaScript so these are two very
popular and there are many more which
are available okay so like to talk about
architectural support you talk about
server side rendering okay so Redux and
there are lot many other tools are also
available
so what is an event in react and how
you're going to create that so react is
basically offering the ideas of handing
the event very fairly easy so let me
talk about clicking anything you talk
about taking your mouse somewhere so
these kind of options generate an event
so for that we typically say alert and
you click on this render you click on
this button in a curly braces you call
the function to trigger to event
now what are the components in react
so friends react components are nothing
but a call View
okay like a complex view can be divided
into the smaller portions
a complex UI can be distributed further
to create more better and reusable views
clear so it splits the user interface
into the independent pieces of code
which can be developed and joins
later on okay so that's how you define
the component in and react so in angular
and react in both the areas the word
component is very much used so the
component meaning is very simple you
talk about a view
so what is the state in a react so state
is react is nothing but is the one which
identify what was and what is now okay
if it stores the value for the specific
period of time with changes and react is
basically detecting those
so it is changing because of some
actions either taken by the users or by
the applications okay so keep tracking
about all those States what it was there
like in I'm talking about an
incrementing an encounter so that is
also the state a variable there okay so
the state object is always initialized
in the Constructor so it can contain the
multiple properties so this dot set
state is used to change the value of the
state object and set state is
responsible
to
perform the shallow merge between the
new state and the previous state
now the state holds the data that a
component renders to the web page
certainly because every time the state
changes so it needs to be stored
somewhere so this is how the state is
accessed as you can see this example
here
in the Constructor we are defining the
super props and the state has been
initialized and you're rendering the
states there are three different steps
are involved initialize the state render
the state and update the states
what is the higher order component and
pure component react higher components
are the component which are typically a
function okay that takes a component and
return a new component to you by
manipulating few things they're
basically designed for the reusing
okay so the higher the components are
typically a function that takes a
component and return a new component
okay so in order to perform some
reusability
a pure components are the components
okay is a variation of rear component
that doesn't
that does a shallow comparison of props
and State
okay shell comparison basically checks
what the equality
are we clear now so that's what the main
job
going ahead what do we Implement and how
do you implement react routing so to
implement a react routing react routing
also comes with inbuild
react modules and that particular module
to import it so
here we Define the react modules by
offering the route path where you have a
call left hand side is the name and the
right hand side is a component which you
would like to deliver it now hello this
is Matthew and we're going to be going
through some of the simple questions
that you would be asked during a node.js
interview what we're going to do is
we're actually going to break out the
section into three key areas there'll be
beginner questions there will be an
intermediate questions and advanced
questions and the expectation is as you
go through this video is that these
questions could be pushed together as
you're going through the interview kind
of think of it like this is if you've
answered the beginner questions that you
would get asked at the beginning of the
interview with confidence and Surety
then the client is going to then jump to
those intermediate Advanced questions
quite quickly and they're looking for
people who can help them serve and solve
their problems at that more intermediate
and advanced level so let's just get
started so the first question you're
probably going to be asked is you know
you know what is node.js you know do you
know what it's for and essentially
node.js is one of the most popular if
not the most popular open source
cross-platform JavaScript programs and
it allows you to build out web
applications that run on the server it's
extremely flexible it allows you to
implement a lot of solutions outside of
just the the core programming runtime
and it allows you to build Solutions
extremely quickly in an open source
mindset for devops
it is used essentially for creating
client-sized web applications we'll see
this later on and you may want to talk a
little bit about using express.js and
how you can build out apis uh to work
with node.js and connecting to databases
such as mongodb
and that is also really good for being
able to store a data intensive
applications that are asynchronous and
event driven in their model and this is
important when you're talking about
creating applications that can scale
rapidly
so you can then ask be asked you know
how does node.js work well node.js
itself is actually built on the V8
engine and the V8 JavaScript engine is
the same engine that runs JavaScript in
your Chrome web browser extremely fast
it allows for high output and
non-blocking uh through your i o input
outputs and is is single threaded event
blue
so you're going to be a van asked you
know where can you use node.js and and
the reality is the applications for
node.js keep expanding but there are
some core applications that you can work
with node.js right now so such as web
applications distributed system and
network applications uh probably
referencing the web applications is a
really good starting point because here
you can actually talk about maybe some
examples that you've done where you're
building out some of these web
applications uh indeed one of the things
that you want to be consistently doing
and peppering your answers with is
examples of work that you have done now
it doesn't matter if those examples are
purely experimental or training examples
that you've done the fact that you've
actually worked with node.js and created
a distributed system or a web
application is really valuable because
it shows that the person that you're
meeting with that you have knowledge and
understanding and practical experience
of applying the theory of working with
new Js with the practice of working with
node.js
so we asked about you know your answer
and essentially the io refers to the
transfer of data in and out of a system
and that's really it you know there's a
reason why Google calls that conference
i o is the transfer of data in and out
of our brains at that conference the
application is same here it's about
moving data in and out of systems
through using node.js and that every um
event can be tracked and whether it's on
a physical device a network or files
within a system again it's input and
output
so let's go through and you know you're
going to be asked you know can you
explain the difference between front end
and back-end development and this is a
question that I can ask a lot when I'm
meeting with clients and you know people
get really confused about what is the
difference between front-end and
back-end development bottom line front
end is what gets resolved inside of your
web browser or the app on your mobile
device backend is what gets resolved
essentially um what we call the the back
office or server-side applications but
it's becoming more and more synonymous
for what gets running the cloud
so web applications
um really get a lot of the functionality
of the web application gets run in the
front end and I think with CSS HTML5 uh
client-side JavaScript so we can get
right on the front end everything else
such as connecting to a database
um gets run behind the scenes in the
back end
and so you know anything that's going to
have like Graphics is going to be on the
front end apis are going to be run on
the back end and then just finally some
of the scripting languages are using on
the front end so HTML CSS JavaScript
those are all Common Core scripting
languages that you would use you can use
Frameworks such as angularjs and
react.js or view those would be a
front-end Frameworks back-end Frameworks
will include Java PHP Python and node.js
are some of the back-end Technologies
you could also throw in their dot net as
well I mean it's just a whole you know
listening of front-end and back-end
Technologies and Frameworks that you can
use and this is a actually a good point
to kind of explain the experience you
have outside of just working with
node.js but other technologies that
you've been working with that
potentially that the client is also
using
so another question you're going to be
asked when you're looking at node.js is
you know can you tell me about npm and
so when somebody asks you what is npm
the first thing you're going to respond
is do you mean node package manager and
the reason why you want to respond like
that is that you want to qualify that
question with understanding that you
know what they're talking about but you
want them to verify that and so node
packet manager is npm
and it's responsible for packaging all
of your modules that you're working with
in node.js and we have a whole series of
videos that we've done on node.js and
every single one of them includes
references to npm
so you're going to be asked you know so
okay you tell me um what it is you know
can you go into a little bit more um
details you know so you can provide two
main functionalities and so one of them
is being able to manage online
repositories of modules and packages
um so you can go to like
search.nodejs.org and you can find a
packages that you can install Into Your
solution such as express.js and it also
provides a command line utility that
allows you to manage your packages very
quickly through terminal window or
command line
I use vs code a lot Visual Studio code
and it has a command line utility built
right into it that allows me to interact
with npm
so what are some of the modules in
node.js and so you know modules um in
node.js they're essentially like
JavaScript libraries so you can think of
some of the JavaScript libraries that
you may have used the functionality is
somewhat the same but they're designed
for node.js and to run on the server and
there are ways in which you can go ahead
and create some of those modules so for
instance if we're creating a web server
you can actually use the require
commands to be able to require that the
server be there so the example we have
on the right hand side shows that we
really do need to have HTTP which is a
web server and we require that to be
installed and so that if you're running
that npm package it will actually
install the HTTP server and then you can
actually write some code to actually
then listen on the localhost port 2000
for where you'll be running your app
application
and there are just you know there's a
whole bunch of modules that I come with
node.js right out of the gate and here
are some of the modules that you have
and we also referenced that just earlier
on HTTP is a core module for uh running
a web server uh you have a utility
function that is useful for developers
to assess features within your node.js
project you have a URL module for any
URL passing you'd be doing
and you also have a stream which allows
you to be able to stream data in and out
of your system and be able to manage how
that's been worked and then zlib which
allows you to compress and decompress
files so that you can keep your storage
of files to a minimum
so a question you're going to be asked
is you know why is node.js being
preferred over back-end Technologies
such as Java and PHP and particularly
gyro it's a very mature stable language
it's been around for more than 20 years
you know PHP
um runs some of them the most powerful
and largest websites out there such as
Facebook so why would you use node.js
well the first response is kind of a
gimme but it is really fast and if you
watched any of the videos that we've
done on node.js building out Solutions
and developing the solutions you'll see
just how fast it is the second is the
really kind of the secret sauce with
node.js is the node package manager and
no package manager allows you to install
additional functionality such as Express
or as a database into your
solution really quick green and there's
over 50 000 bundles available for node
package manager
if you're building out a real-time
application that's data intensive and
you need to have apis quickly developed
then node.js is another great it's
really the great solution for you it
allows you to build out these Solutions
really quickly
and there is a easy synchronization
between the server and the client due to
the code base
and then finally because the structure
of node.js is Javascript if you are
making the pivot from being a front-end
web developer to node.js it's just going
to make it a lot easier for you to pick
up node.js because you have that common
language of JavaScript and on top of
that JavaScript is the world's most
popular scripting language
so let's talk about some of the
differences between angular node.js and
so and the reason why this question may
come up is the person interviewing you
is seeing whether or not you do know the
difference between a front-end framework
and a back-end framework and this is one
of those questions where you can go well
there are differences but the
differences are because they complement
each other so angular is a front-end
development framework whereas node.js is
a server side and framework are the
differences though between the actual
Frameworks themselves is that angular is
written in typescript which is a
modification of JavaScript node.js is
written in C and C plus plus
anger is used for building out single
play client-side web applications and so
that's a keyword there is client-side
whereas node.js is about building out
fast and scalable server-side Network
applications uh so uh again the two
complement each other
uh angular splits web applications into
the MVC and model view control
components whereas node.js generates a
lot of database crazy it does more than
that as well but you can think of
node.js as that glued to your database
so let's talk a little bit about when
you're connecting to a database with
node.js and so you're going to probably
asking what is the most popular database
used with node.js and there are a couple
mongodb is largely the most popular
nosql cross-platform database MySQL is
also very popular and that's a more
traditional relational database
you would go with mongodb for really
more modern solutions when you're
looking at creating an application
that's going to really scale into just
managing masses and masses of data that
has to be created red updated and
deleted very very quickly
for some of the other popular libraries
that you use for node.js Express JS is a
very popular one and I really like
working with express.js allows me to
build out web applications really
quickly more importantly it allows me to
build out apis very quickly and which
you know apis are essentially web
applications themselves but being able
to do that very quickly with a framework
like express.js is very useful uh
Mongoose is an application that makes
connecting to a database really
easy so here is an example of express.js
which is a in itself really a flexible
but a solution that you can do lots with
and Mongoose which is a more focused
solution which allows you know to you
make it easier to connect to your
databases
so you know what are the pros and cons
of working with node.js there's lots of
ways we explain this earlier on that you
can actually build out applications that
run on the cloud why would you you know
what's uh the pros and cons so a pro is
that node.js is extremely fast at
processing thing and event based model
uh it really is fast I can't is if you
have something that is a very heavy
computational task it's not so good at
that now I will caveat that this is that
node.js is getting better all the time
and so you might have to be provide an
example of what a very heavy
computational task is and that may be uh
calculating a risk on an insurance
application against many many variables
that maybe something that's seen as
computationally very heavy but what you
can do in that example is you can
offload the task to another Solution
that's designed for it and use apis to
pass the data back and forth Pro
JavaScript is used for building out your
applications with node.js great lots of
people know JavaScript
a restriction and again this is evolving
as JavaScript itself evolves is that
when you do a callback you may end up
doing lots of nested callbacks um if
you're doing something that's very
complicated again another way around the
con and so this is one of the things
that I always look for is if you have a
blocker or a barrier how do you get
around that barrier and so for instance
when you're talking uh to your recruiter
you can say look the reason why I use
node.js is that it's fast it's event but
it's driven I can use JavaScript there
are some challenges and but what I do to
get around those challenges are and
that's where you can say that you know
you may run the complex script off and
you may write that in.net or Java or PHP
and then use an API to do the response
back into node.js so you get the
benefits of Both Worlds but minimize the
investment in having to manage a complex
environment such as Java versus a
relatively simple environment with
node.js the node package manager makes
it extremely easy to access just an
awful lot of functionality with over 50
000 packages there's a package for that
so from being able to have a tool that
creates unique identifiers that you
might need to have for generating
content that gets posted into a database
through to being able to connect to
databases through you know to running so
many different solutions and the npm
package manager with its access to so
many different packages makes it great
for
um getting access to all that content
now Khan is working with relational
databases with node.js isn't as easy as
a nosql database now you can do it and
there are ways around that and what I
would do when this question comes up is
always kind of pivots to say hey this is
how you can actually then get around
building out that application
designed for streaming huge amounts of
data in and out a con is that node.js is
single threaded and so it can be CPU
intensive but again there are ways
around that and a good way around that
is scaling Your solution and elastic
environment such as the cloud
so what is the command used to import an
external library and so to import an
external Library the command is the
require command and so an example we
have here is uh you can assign a
variable and the variable is going to be
for HTTP and you're going to then
require the HTTP service and that means
that the application itself won't run
unless the external Library the HTTP
library is installed
okay so those were our introductory uh
questions for node.js this kind of pivot
and take a look at the intermediate
questions that you would be asked
so what does event driven programming
mean so event driven programming means
that if something happens something else
will happen in response so for instance
if you click a mouse that Mouse click is
an event that means something has to
respond to that event just think of it
as cause and effect it's just the basic
motion of physics so that's what a vent
driven programming means
you also look at it as a callback
function so that when an element is
executed something will happen in
response
so what is an event Loop in node.js so
an event Loop in node.js is when you do
an asynchronous call and what that
essentially means is that you are
sending out data and then a non-blocking
input output from node.js is pulling
data back in
what is an event emitter in node.js so
an event meta has really two areas of
focus one is that it manages uh the
classes that hold all the objects within
your event and we have an example of
this on the right hand side and then
whenever an event actually is thrown the
functions are then called on that event
synchronously so for instance we have in
our example on the right hand side we
create an event and then we have the
functions and that executed in a series
from that event
so let's talk about the API functions in
node.js so there are two types one is an
asynchronous non-blocking function and
the second is a synchronous blocking
function and the difference between the
two of them is asynchronous is that
there is no structure to the order
if I have the API is resolved
synchronous means that when the feedback
from the API is received you have to
execute the response in a series for how
the response is sent to you
so what is a package Json file so the
package Json file is at the heart of our
node.js package when we actually will
initialize a solution a folder to be in
node.js package
you'll find that the package itself
holds all of the metadata that's
particular to the project you're working
on such as project name version
requirements it is you have to have it
installed in the root of the directory
for the project and again look at any of
the videos that we have on node.js we do
have demonstrations within those videos
that actually then go through and break
out how to create that root package and
you'll see how you can actually then go
ahead and update the instructions or the
metadata within the package so here we
have an example of what that metadata
looks like so again this kind of
continues that question of what is a
packet Json file and you may be asked
you know what is the metadata and why is
it important and the metadata is a basic
Json collection of pairing of a key
details such as name version description
and then and the custom version that you
put so for instance under name you could
create a name for your project there
can't be any spaces what is the version
and the description and what is the main
or starting path and for the solution
typically that would be index.js but it
could be anything.js but index.js is
typical simply because
index.html is the starting point for a
typical web application
so how would you use a URL module in
node.js
so with a URL module what it allows you
to do is really two things one is that
it provides the resolution passing of a
URL for Utilities in your application
and then it allows you to extend your
module with built-in Solutions and split
up the web address into a readable
format
so in this example we have the URL and
the response it would would give for
that URL which would then be a year and
month and it'll be in a readable format
so they would read out as 2020 and then
the month
so what is express.js and you've heard
me mentioned this a couple of times in
the video and we actually have a
separate video on express.js and
express.js is a web application
framework that allows you to build out
Web Solutions for both mobile and
traditional desktop right inside of
node.js so it's very easy to use
and being able to install and web.js is
as simple as requiring Express to be
installed in the example that we have
here on the screen it's a full solution
of showing how to actually build out a
solution with web.js so in this example
you start off the first two lines
required Express to be installed and the
store comes from node package manager
then we have a simple application that
will then send to the browser window a
hello world message confirming that
Express is up and running and then the
third block of content starting with
virus server actually will Define the
port where your application is going to
run so in this instance the port is
going to run on localhost and the port
will be Port 8081 and so you can
actually go to localhost colon 8081 and
when you do that that will trigger the
Apple application that will forward up
the message hello world and it's all
coming from express.js
so what are streams in node.js so
streams are objects that allow you to
read and write data continuously back
and forth within your application and
there's really four different types of
streams there's readable writable duplex
and transform
the readable one stream for which data
can be read
the writable streams that you can
actually write to a duplex is a stream
where it is both readable and writable
and transform our streams that can be
manipulated the data while it is being
read or written
so how do you update and delete a
dependency so say for instance we want
to install something like Express so if
you wanted to install Express what you
would do is you would just write them
inside of your project you want to go to
terminal window and write in the command
npm install Express
if you want to update the dependencies
within your node package manager to
update all of them all you have to do is
write the command npm update all
dependencies
and then if you want to explicitly
uninstall a dependency such as
express.js that's using the uninstall
command and so that would again be going
to terminal window and you would type
npm uninstall Express
and again it's really easy to create a
simple server in node.js that will run a
simple command the HTTP service is
actually built into node.js you don't
need to use express.js I typically use
express.js when I want to do a web
server because typically what I find is
that I will want to go and do something
more complicated but if you want to do
something that illustrates just the core
functionality within node.js you can
actually just require the core HTTP
service that actually comes as part of
node.js and then you can actually then
go ahead and tell it to create a service
and then to write in plain text I
command or text string such as this case
it'll be hello world and that would pop
out and then the final line is to then
listen that if you go to a web browser
that's on
port127.0.01 or localhost and go to Port
colon 8080 once you actually go to that
that will trigger this application and
you'll get the text hello world pop up
on your screen
so explain synchronous and non-blocking
apis in node.js
so all the apis in node.js are
asynchronous which means that they are
non-blocking which means you can run
them continuously and scale around that
which is just fantastic it's one of the
reasons why node.js can scale so fast
and the eighth means that the apis can
return data send data after it's been
called and really increase the
efficiency of events as they are
triggered Within node.js
so how do you implement async and
node.js and so the example that we have
on the left hand side allows us to
trigger async and it's using the async
function and as you can see in this
example it's actually something that can
be done very quickly in this example
we're actually making a command to logo
host and an app that's running on Port
3000 and then depending on what we get
if there's an error message and then
we'll have error message go to the
console log which is the terminal window
and if we get a response to an
application then we'll actually get a
positive response which would be fetched
response so again very quick and easy
that you use the async function to be
able to build out and you to get your
asynchronous code
so what is the purpose of module exports
so a module export is a way to
encapsulate your the entire code for a
solution in a single package in a single
file and then you can then share that
with other developers so you're all
working from the same environment well
