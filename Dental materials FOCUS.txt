yeah hi Venus and now I'm here to
explain you very important things
related to the dental materials such it
so we'll be dealing some tables which
are very very important in examination
point of view as this video will be
there until you give the exam on our
website so no need to write notes but
people who are very interested to write
their own note says can proceed okay the
first and foremost thing is about the
composition and the individual
ingredient function of agar and
Antonette okay so if you go very deep
into this the main component that is
present in the agar is water okay water
occupies the major percent is and it is
also called as a reaction medium okay
and it is a balanced one okay the main
component the major component is water
if water is not there in the options the
next major component is again so agar
stands second in the composition of
other that is 13 to 17 percentage and
the most commonly asked question what is
the function it acts as brush shape
structure in Agra okay the next goes is
the strength for agar you know the
dagger is the more flexible the strength
of other is basically due to borate and
it is its person to the 0.2 to 0.5% s
and the gypsum hardener that is added to
the agar is the sulfate its percent is
this 1 to 2 and the Fiddler's are the
maxis that is 0.5 to 1 percent s and the
last one is the gel that is added which
is 0.3 to 0.5 percentage okay so all
these numbers are very important the
values are important and the functions
are important okay so if they're asking
a question on the composition the area
will be from this so next course is the
composition of alginate
so the major composure percentage will
be occupied or the ingredient is nigh
domitius earth that is 60% s and the
next ask question is they can ask you
like the major component is fillers how
much how much person days is fulness
that is 60 plus four sixty four okay
both this gene set as well as this
diatomaceous earth both acts as a filler
so topped by 64% this regular last
question is the major component in the
composition of agar are the major
component in the composition of alginate
is the most commonly asked question okay
so next question what I have regularly
seen that is 2019 and 18 need question
that is the reactor the reactor in our
Jeanette is calcium sulfate that of the
best 16% is and the gypsum hardener hi
can you get they have we have a
different gypsum hartnett we have a
different gypsum hardener in the agar
and we have a different gypsum hardener
in the case of alginate so don't get
confused and this is the most common
area where they allow to ask because we
regularly get confused in this er that
is potassium titanium fluoride is again
a most commonly asked question ok so
again this is an important area of neat
and Ames okay the retarder in the case
of alginate is sodium phosphate okay so
please do learn this rate this practices
and it's an important area of the
function the major component is the
first most commonly asked question and
the second most commonly asked question
is a function of individual component
and the third most commonly asked
question is the composition person dis
hope you're clear and we are going to
the next level okay so this table in
elastomeric impression material sis is
something like a godfather okay it's the
most important thing and the paper
sector cannot leave this and go to the
next level okay so if if there is a
question of course there will be a
question from elastomeric impression
materials in any sort of exam whether it
is going to be a pga or ames or neat or
chip mer you will have a question and
the first choice to pick a question is
from this area okay
so before going into this okay
make sure that the composition of all
these four okay the four are important
the composition similar to the agar
alginate composition you have to learn
about the composition the components
that are present in this the activators
that represent in this and everything
that is required in the composition
because we have seen multiple questions
on this area of course we are going to
discuss that part on the group but make
sure that this classification and this
compositions are very very important
okay so the next one is before going
deep into this table because you need to
play with this table from all the
directions okay the first thing that you
have to make a note is about the
sequence the sequence okay sequence
based questions are nowadays common in
the aims there will be at least two
sequence based question in 200 of 200
marks of aims so this is an area where
they can pick sequence based question of
course if you open your basic mcq books
and solve impression materials you will
find many questions on the strength
properties working times and XYZ related
to this table okay the first thing that
you have to make a note is about the
sequence that is the first one is in the
table is sulfate that is poly sulphide
the second one is condensation silicon
the third one is addition silicon and
the fourth one is the poly ether okay so
you need to make a note about the
sequence and then you need to work on
this okay the first one that we are
going to deal is the Working Time okay
so working time they have given question
the working time of poly sulphide is the
question that is most commonly repeated
that is four to seven minutes and rest
all are on a range that is 2 to 4 this
is 4 to 7 highest and rest all are in a
range of 2 to 4 you can see okay so they
can ask you which other falling has
highest working time the answer is poly
sulphide the next goes to the second
parameter that is setting time the
setting time also almost the poly
sulphide stands first with 7 to 10
minutes and this is a question that is
already given in the examination and the
rest all they have arranged they say
they are have a range that range is
somewhere around 4 to 8 okay no need to
remember all those values but make a
note like this is compared to this this
compared to this is a question that they
can logically ask you so high
for working time inserting time the poly
sulphide which stands first the next one
is tear strength the date strength is
highest again for the poly sulphide okay
and the percentage contraction at 24
hours again polysulfides stands first
okay so these are important where
polysulfides stands first and the
comparison and the order are important
I'm focusing more on the questions which
are already asked are questions which
can be given okay so you try to cover
everything but make sure you don't miss
what I am stressing wrong next one I
hope you know the contact angle
okay the concept of contact angle to the
wettability so the contact angle as the
contact angle increases the wettability
decreases as the variability decreases
the contact angle increases so so bad
so impression material having low
contact angle are water-loving
impression materials having high contact
angle or water phobic hydrophobic
hydrophilic is a regularly asked
question it is just based upon the
values of contact angle so if you go
deep into this okay the least contact
angle is for the poly ether means it is
more water-loving which are the
following is hydrophilic or which of the
following is comparatively a
water-loving material then you can go
for poly ether as an answer and if you
see the valley's that is eighty to
ninety eight degrees and you have to
Alice for addition silicon that is
ninety eight and 53 okay hope you are
clear with this so we go into the next
level that is hydrogen gas release okay
hydrogen gas released yes it is s for
addition silicon where it is no the
hydrogen gas is released by the addition
silicon very good next one next course
is otto mixing automatic mixing systems
are available for the last two that is
addition silicon and poly ether custom
tray can be used for poly sulfide but
not for the rest next one unpleasant
order is again present in the poly
sulfide
multiple casts with a single impression
can be done with addition silicon and
can be done with the poly ether
stiffness okay okay the value one stands
the topper okay so the topper of the
batch is the poly ether which it stands
first
okay the next goes they share this
values okay the last one is this okay I
hope you're very clear with this and
next course is the destruction on
removal value one indicates the greatest
and value 4 indicates the least so value
one is this two three and four these are
the most commonly asked sequence based
questions okay so make a note so please
do learn everything whatever that is
required from this table and just try to
practice this once or twice whenever you
have time so that's going to increase
your capability to go with the right
answer so next one is the guidelines or
the disinfection protocols for the
impression materials okay so if you go
very deep into this there are a few
questions which are asked from this area
but make make a note okay so the first
one is how do you handle this alternate
okay so alginate uses only disinfectant
for a shorter duration of time that is
less than 10 minutes and the
disinfectants that are required for this
are chlorine fluoride or chlorine
components and I dispose and the
comments that are added here are the
short-term rotor 'old head has been
shown to be acceptable but the time is
inadequate for its disinfection means
glutaraldehyde
has to be used for a longer duration of
time for its effect to be the at the
best okay but here in this condition you
are not exposing for more than 10
minutes but even if you are if you are
doing this
minutes for clitoral hide that
disinfection levels will be very very
nice okay the next course the next
important area is poly ether okay and
even in the poly ethyl so the situation
is for a short duration of exposure and
the material that is used is almost the
same and when you go with jet boy in
pression paste either you have to do and
I mean the preferred technique they can
ask that preferred technique is
immersion or you can spray you can spray
the disinfectant solution on the bite
registration and the material that is
used is glutaraldehyde and ida force
okay so please do add and note about
this table this is not that important
but it looks they can it look it looks
like they can pick some questions and
they can trap you okay so this is again
an important area not a number based
area but it's very important so the next
course is the properties okay the
properties of the gypsum products
basically the types and their names are
very very important I hope you are very
good at this so I will be focusing more
on the numbers that are regularly asked
in this area first of all is water
powder ratio so as you move from type 1
to type 5 the water power by powder
ratio it decreases okay they can ask you
individual values also that is already
they have given a question on this that
is 0.5 to 0.75 is a water by powder
ratio for impression for impression
plaster and 0.18 to 0.2 to is in a water
by powder ratio for the dental stone
which is high strength and high
expansion and the next one is setting
time the setting time is least for the
type 1 and it is the same for almost all
that is from type 2 to type 5 it is same
that is 12 plus or minus 4 minutes
whereas for the type 1 it is 4 plus or
minus 1 minute okay the next course is
the expansion the setting expansion they
talk both about the minimum
function the maximum expansion that is
to hover expansion and specifically you
need to focus on this area in the
minimum expansion because the minimum
expansion is 0 here 0 here 0 here 0 here
so the only material which has a minimum
expansion in the setting expansion
values is the type for dental stone high
strength and high expansion which has a
minimum okay because it the word already
says it is highly expansion so the
minimum expansion is only for the high
expansion dental stone that is 0.10 and
of course you need to focus on these
valleys the maximum expansion is 0.15
for type 10.30 for type 2 0 point 2 0
for type 3
0.10 for type 4 and 0.30 for type 5 okay
so they can ask you which are the
following setting expansion will be a
maximum value or the minimum value so
basing upon that you need to pick the
option and last but not the least is the
compressive strength
okay the values it increases from type 1
to type file so they can ask the values
and they can ask you to arrange them in
the sequence so make a note numbers are
very very important in general materials
but you need to remember numbers the
revision is important for to do a proper
revision time management is very very
important for an intern or even if it is
very repeated okay so finally I want to
conclude I'm very we are very happy the
team of MDS concur is very happy that we
made our student has made all India 4th
rank in the recent aims result and we
are very happy to share this so the
suggestion from my said is to make such
great things ok for for a great things
to happen with us or in our life we need
consistency ok we need a hard work
oriented a little bit smartness is added
we need such preparations but what what
I regularly see in the most of online
students is online students will not be
monitored by the mentor even if you go
in a wrong direction the mentor will not
know that you are going in a wrong
direction okay so you need to come out
and talk with the mentor that sir I feel
like I'm my preparation is not up to the
mark in the last two or three days my
preparation is deviated from the
original path in the last one week or
the last one month then the mentor can
help you out
so dedication is very very important and
the consistency is utmost important to
be successful in life not only in an
entrance but in any part of your life
both the dedication as well as the
consistency within a time are very very
important factors to be successful so
please take such people these people
into consideration or an inspiration and
start working towards your goals okay
thank you I'll stay positive
