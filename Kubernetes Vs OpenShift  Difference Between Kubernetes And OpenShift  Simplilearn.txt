booming e-commerce startup your team has
been working over time to bundle up your
main apps into containers and now is the
time to pick a platform to handle and
manage them all smoothly you've heard of
two popular options kubernets the open
source container system and open shift
the Enterprise kubernets distribution
from had but which one is better fit for
your business needs if you're new to the
world of containers and Cloud native
Technologies this video is for you today
we will have an introduction to both
kubernets and open shift and then dive
into the key differences between these
two powerful platforms further
understanding the main differences
between these two platforms moreover we
will look at how the application
deployment process differs the tooling
and interfaces provided for managing
applications and monitoring and
crucially the security and compliance
features that each platform offers by

and enroll now to become a successful
devops engineer so without further Ado
let's get started first let's start with
the basics understanding what is
kubernets so kubernets is just like the
master conductor for your containers
think of it as this super smart system
that helps you manage all your
containerized apps smoothly especially
when you've got loads of them it's open
source which means it's free to use and
has become the go to choice for handling
containers on a big scale with kubernets
you get this awesome toolkit for
automatically deploying scaling and
looking after all those containerized
workloads to deploy an app on kubernets
you'd create yl manifest files that
describe the different components the
container image scaling requirements
networking configuration and so on this
flexibility is great as it allows you to
customize cuber needs to your heart's
content but it also means there's a fair
amount of complexity involved especially
when it comes to setting up supporting
tools for monitoring logging cicd
pipelines and more let me walk you
through an example say you want to
deploy your e-commerce web application
on kubernets first you'd provision a
cubanet cluster either on premises or on
a cloud provider then you'd write the
necessary ymo manifest to describe your
app and apply those to the cluster the
kubernetes dashboard gives you
visibility into the state of your
deployment but to really monitor and
manage your apps you'd likely need to
integrate additional tools like
Prometheus grafana and custom cicd
workflows now to contrast with open
shift let's explore how it builds upon
cuber needs and differentiates Itself by
understanding what open shift is open
shift is built on top of kubernets but
it adds a number of Enterprise great
features and an opinionated approach to
container management the key difference
is the open shift web console
this is a centralized Hub where you can
deploy manage and monitor all of your
applications in one place it abstracts
away a lot of the underlying kubernets
complexity making it easier for
developers and operators to work with
for example to deploy your Ecommerce app
on open shift you could simply click a
button in the console to create a new
application open shift would then handle
all the kubernets Manifest and
configurations for you in a much more
streamlined experience compared to the
man ual yaml editing required in
kubernets let us now dive a bit deeper
into some of the key areas where
kubernets and open shift diverge at
first we have deployment and automation
kubernets requires more Hands-On work to
set up cicd pipelines and streamline the
deployment process whereas open shift
which is built on top of kubernets
provides a lot of deployment and
automation functionality out of the box
also configuring netor working in
kubernets can be more complex as you
need to set up load balancers and other
networking components to expose your
applications to the outside world on the
other hand open shift includes a
userfriendly web console and command
line interface that simplify the setup
and management of cicd pipelines
networking and other deployment related
tasks in case of Cub needs developers
and devops teams often need to write
more custom scripts and configurations
to aut automate the deployment process
many of the commonly used deployment and
automation tools like Jenkins tekon are
pre-integrated and configured in open
shift making it easier to set up a
robust software delivery pipeline also
setting up and managing a robust cicd
pipeline in kubernets requires more
effort as you need to integrate various
tools and services example Jenkins Argo
CD and tech0 to handle the different
stages of the software delivery life
cycle whereas open shifts deployment
automation features such as image builds
automatic scaling can significantly
reduce the manual effort required to
manage the deployment process okay let
us now dive into the differences between
kubernets and open shift when it comes
to application management the kubernetes
dashboard provides basic visibility and
management capabilities for your
applications and resources the open
shift console on the other hand provides
a more robust and unified view of your
application management kubernets allows
you to view running pods services
deployments and other kubernetes objects
as well as perform some basic
administrative tasks whereas the open
shift console offers a comprehensive
dashboard that displays information
about your running applications
including metrics logs events and
resource utilization kubernetes has
limited functionality and doesn't
provide a comprehensive view of your
entire appli application portfolio open
shift console includes features like
application Health monitoring deployment
management and security scanning all
within a single pane of glass to get a
more complete understanding of your
application's performance in kubernets
and logs we need to integrate external
monitoring and logging tools such as
Prometheus graphon and elastic search
which add complexity to the setup and
management which is not in the case of
open shift open shift provides more
Advan features such as the ability to
view application dependencies perform
rolling updates and manage scaling and
autoscaling policies although kubernetes
has made great strides in security open
shift really shines when it comes to
providing Enterprise great security
features out of the box let us now look
into the main differences between
kubernets and open shift when it comes
to security and compliance kubernetes
has made significant progress in
security over the years with features
like role-based access control for
security policies and network policies
on the other hand open shift being built
on top of kubernets inherits all of
these security features but also adds
Enterprise grade security capabilities
out of the box rbsc allows you to Define
fine grain permissions for users and
service accounts controlling access to
kubernetes resources whereas open shift
provides more secure container defaults
such as running containers as a non-root
user and disabling privileged containers
by default part security policies in
kubernetes provide a way to set security
related constraints on pods such as
restricting the use of privileged
containers or running containers as a
non-root user open shift also integrates
seamlessly with Enterprise identity
management systems such as ldap and
active directory allowing you to
leverage existing authentication and
mechanisms Network policies in Cub needs
allow you to control the network traffic
flow between pods improving the overall
security of your cluster on the other
hand open shift also includes security
scanning and vulnerability management
features helping you identify and
address potential security risks in your
container images and
applications however these security
features in kubernetes require manual
configuration and set up by the devop
team to ensure the cluster is properly
secured additionally windshift provides
strong encryption for data in transit
and AR rest as well as audit logging and
advanced features making it a suitable
choice for organizations to simplify
Security Management and reduce the
overhead for devops teams let us now
understand which might be a better
choice kubernets or open shift so in
summary kubernets offers more low-level
control and flexibility while open shift
prioritizes ease of use and Enterprise
grade capabilities the right choice with
will depend on factors like your team's
existing expertise your security and
compliance requirements and your overall
business needs if you have a large
Enterprise with complex security and
operational demands open shift may be a
better fit but if you have a highly
technical team and value more
customization cuber needs could be the
way to go ultimately I would encourage
you to evaluate both platforms and see
which one aligns best with your
organization's unique requirements let
