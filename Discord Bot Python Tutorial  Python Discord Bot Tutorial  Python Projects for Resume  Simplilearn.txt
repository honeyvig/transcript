foreign
YouTube channel and in this tutorial we
will learn to create a Discord mode and
add it to our Discord Channel and here
we will learn how to get the following
responses from the board the responses
would be text image video document or
audio
and before starting let us have a simple
question to brush upon our knowledge and
it's related to this code and your
question is what is the minimum age to
use Discord and your options are
the first option is 18
the second option is 13 and the third
option is 15 and the fourth option you
get is none of these so please answer in
the comment section below pause the
video give it a thought and answer in
the comment section and I have an
insightful for you guys if you are
focused on building strong foundational
skills for career growth in that case
you can check out a free course to Learn
Python Basics with a completion
certificate from scale up by simply
learn you can check this course with the
link in the description box below
and now first we'll see the demo of a
Discord board and then we'll start to
create a project and for that we will
move to our Visual Studio code so this
is our video Studio code and this is the
code for uh the simple Discord port
we will also create the music Discord
bot but first we'll create the simple
Discord board to just get the responses
from the board as text image files or
video
so we'll save this
and run this
so it shows that we have logged in as
simply learn both
so we will move to Discord and I have
created the simply learn server and in
that I have the simply learn board
we will go step by step and I will show
you how to create a server
and you can see the simply on board it's
active it's showing the green sign or
the Green Dot
and here
we'll see what were the commands
if we just write High
so we are in the general Channel and if
we write High
we get the response from the simple land
board as hello
and
if we write image we'll get the image
that is rewind.png and this image is
stored in the same folder as of the
project and if we write video we will
get the python dot MP4 this file is also
stored in the same folder and the audio
will get this one and this file is also
stored in the same folder and if we
write file we'll get the same file that
is python.pdf and that is stored
in the same folder
so I'll show you some commands
uh
I will write image
and the board responds me with the
rewind.png that is stored in the folder
I will show you guys
so
this is the divine.png what I got when I
wrote image
so moving on now we'll start with a
board and I will show you the demo of
music port before creating that
now
the first thing we will do is create a
new folder for our project and we'll
create a folder
and name it as
this code board
using
python
and in this folder we'll open the
command prompt
and we'll open our
ideally that is Visual Studio code you
can use any ideally that you have hands
on we will be using the visual studio
code
and here
we will create a file and name it as
main.py
and before starting the first thing we
should do is
install and import the libraries and
before starting let us have a simple
discussion about what is a Discord so
this code is a voice and text
communication platform for gamers
players streamers and developers use
this code to discuss games answer
questions chat while they play and much
more it even has a game store complete
with critical reviews and a subscription
service it is nearly a One-Stop shop for
game communities I'll show you I have
downloaded the desktop version of
Discord
so this is a Discord and while there are
many things you can build using Discord
apis this tutorial will focus on a
particular learning outcome how to make
a Discord bot in Python and if I tell
you what is a board so automated
programs that look and act like users
and automatically respond to events and
commands on Discord are called boat
users
so this was the brief about the Discord
and what is the board now we'll start
with how to create a Discord mode
so first you should have an account on
Discord
for that you could simply go to the
Discord website and register for that
and you can if you're on desktop you can
download the desktop app or you can
access the Discord within the browser
now you should have an account on this
code
and you should create a server in that
to create a server you can see this plus
sign just click on that that is add a
server and now you can see
for whom you want to create the server
I want to create a server for my friends
and that would be for me and my friends
and
he's asking for the server's name
so we will write
project server
and we'll click on the create button
so we have created a server and it has
channels that is General Games music and
voice channels that is launch and stream
room
now we have created a server now we will
move to this code
development website for that
we will write this code developer portal
and this is the website that is HTTP
colon slash disco.com developers talks
intro
so
in this website
we will create a new application so
first we have to go to the applications
and I've created three applications and
here we will create a new application
and name it as
project
we will take all the permissions and
click on the create
and now you could see the general
information about the Discord board
so if you want to upload any icon you
can do that for your board and we have
named it as project
and we can tag it as boat
and
chatbot
and moving on
now
we'll go to the board
okay so first
we will save the changes
and now we'll go to the board and click
on ADD board and now we have to confirm
by clicking yes do it
now after the boat is added
now we'll copy the board token and
before that
we'll just give the board permissions
and before giving the bot permissions
we'll go to the authorization tool
and here
will select in-app authorization
and we'll select the scope as bot and
give the permissions add an
administrator permissions
and here we will save the change
and in the URL generator
we will
select the scope as board and the board
permissions will set it as administrator
and we'll copy this URL
and paste it here
just to store that and we will open that
in the browser
we have to open this
in the browser
and here we'll see
the server we have created the project
server we'll select that and we'll click
on continue and it has the administrator
will authorize it and it's asking if we
are a human or not
so we'll just
so let's capture
and you can see that our both is
authorized
so we'll see in the Discord
that project just showed up that is the
project board so it has showed up but
it's offline
so now we have to make it online we'll
do it by writing a code
and before that
we have to generate the token
overboard
so in the authorization 2 we have
done the things and here we have
generated
the link and authorized our board now
here
will give the permissions
that is requires authorization to code
Grant
and sentient so member intent okay we
will give all the permissions as we
would be creating the music board also
so
for that we would be requiring the
administrator permissions
and that is all these permissions send
messages create private threads
attach files so that
so here we'll save the changes
and to get the token of a Discord both
we'll click on the reset token
and click on the yes to it so we'll copy
this token
and paste it here so it's a token and
this was the URL to authorize a Discord
mode
so we would be using this token in a
code to activate our board and to get it
online
and
if you get your token
mishandle or you have given to someone
you can just reset it so after this
project I will reset this token so you
guys can't use my token
so
moving on
now
we will install some libraries that
would be Discord Library
and to install that
I will show you the simple commands
that is present in the browser you just
have to write
install
Discord
python
Library okay
and this is the official website
you just have to copy the command
move to a command prompt or The Terminal
of your ID and just paste this command
and
press enter
you can see that the requirement is
already satisfied as I have already
installed the Discord Library so
here I don't have to install it again
and you can do it just by writing the
command in the command prompt over in
the terminal and here we are using pip
to install the command
now moving on
after installing the libraries
and
authorizing our
Discord board now we'll write code to
get a board online and get some
responses from him
so
first we'll import the Discord library
and put that we'll write the command
import
Discord
so here we are important the Discord and
now
first
we'll get our Port online and for that
first we'll set the intents
that is
Discord
Dot
intense
not all
and after that
we will
create a variable client and in that
we will call Discord dot client
and inside we'll write command prefix so
if you want to give any command so if it
has the prefix that will enter so board
would understand that
that would be exclamation mark and we'll
set the intents
that is intense
equal to
in bits we have created a variable
inside the intents
now
we will create a
event that would be client dot event you
could visit the Discord
official website and see the
documentation of how to install it that
is if you want to use the PIP command
you can use that in Linux
and
you could see the voice code by NaCl we
will install it for our Music board and
you can see this is the quick example to
see how we can use the Discord Library
so we have set the intents
and
now
we're gonna make a board active
so you could just visit the
documentation read it once and you would
understand how this library is
functioning and what classes and
functions it possess
so we'll move back to our ideally
and here we will create the event
for that we'll write at the rate
client
that the variable we have created dot
event
and
inside it
will use async
and create a function
that is on underscore ready
foreign
we will print
that we have logged in as
if
a board has logged in
it should get printed
we have logged in as
the name of the
user or
a port
okay
and write dot format
and inside will pass client
now
we'll create another event that is at
the rate
client
note event
and inside
we will
create another function
that is own underscore message so if we
give any message to a port
he will reply to us
so message
and if
message dot author so he is writing the
message is equal to
client dot user
then we'll just return
and if
message dot content
Dot
starts with that is if the message
starts with hi or we can write hello
so a board should respond with something
so if our message starts with high
so we will await
and
message Dot
Channel
dot send
will send hello
and now to
make a board active the last thing we
have to do is
we have two run a token random board
with the help of token
so you know we have copied the token and
that we have copied here
so I'll copy this
and paste it in client dot run
so we'll save this
and run it
so you could see that
it has shared logging and using static
token
and it has shared the session ID that
the board has been logged in and what we
have printed is that we have logged in
as project hashtag 7634
so here we will move to a
Discord
and here you can see that a board has
been online after we have run the code
that is we can see the green symbol for
that and we have written the commands if
we
write hi to a boat or the message which
starts with high
it would respond to us so you could
directly chat with the board here that
is just click on its
symbol and you can message at the red
project at the red project that is your
board so we'll just write hi here
and you could see that a board responds
with hello
and if we go back to our project server
so this is a project server and if we
write hi in any channel that is we are
writing in general Channel
and press enter so here also our Port
will respond that is hello
so now we'll add other functionalities
so that a port could respond to us in
different ways so now we will ask our
board to send an image so the image
could be sent through the port in the
form of file we need to give the name to
it and the file should be in the same
directory where our code is it could be
done by running the code that I will
just
show you
so here
now we'll start with if
message
dot content
load
starts with
image that is if we have image
oh sorry
that would be heavily that is own
message we are writing in the function
that is own message and if the
message.content starts with image If the
message has image in it
so what we will do is
we will write a command that is await
message Dot channel in which channel we
have quote the command as image from the
author we will write the or send the
file that is the port will send the file
in the same channel that is
message.channel dot send
and here
we will write the file name
and for that
first we'll see which files
so I have some files that I have
used
formerly
so
that I've stored in yeah new folder so
yeah
so these are the files that will ask
about to return us back
that is the image rewind.png python PDF
and the python mp4 file and the MP3 file
beautiful mistakes
so we will
copy all these
and paste in our
directly
in the same directory that we are coding
that we are writing a code
now we'll move back to our Visual Studio
code
and here we'll write
the file name that is
file equal to Discord
Dot file
your Discord dot file and now the name
of the
file
that was rewind.png
so we'll save this
and first run it to check if this
command is working or not
so first we'll kill our terminal
save it and run it
and we can see that it has given the
session ID and we have logged in as
project bot we will move
to our Discord
and here we will write image in the
channel
you can see data board responded with
the rewind.png image
so
a command is working fine
now
after running this code that is the Type
image in the channel now the board will
respond with the image that we have
given in the file and we have seen that
now we'll get the video audio and a PDF
file through the board now to get these
first we must share the file name in the
file section for the file that we need
to share through the board in order to
acquire the video audio or the file
now we need to keep that file in the
same directory where our code is there
as we have seen that we have kept that
in the same folder now
we will write the commands for video
audio and the PDF file
now first we will write the command for
video
and that is if
message dot content
Dot start with
that is video
wait
message Dot
Channel
dot send
here we'll write the file name that is
file equal to
this code
Dot file
and inside
will pass python dot MP4
and that would be in the inverted commas
sorry for cuffing oh
I have a net account
now we have set for the video now we'll
set for the audio file and for that
we'll write the command that is the same
command and we won't waste any time
we'll just copy it
hmm
we should code as fast as we can
and if the message contains the audio
so what will pass we'll just see what we
have
the name of the audio file that is
beautiful underscore mistakes
and that is MP3
beautiful
underscore
I think just check it
and that is yeah I missed capital
so now we have written for the audio
file now we'll write
for the simple file
that is our PDF
so if I command that is the command we
will give to our board if it contains
the name file then it will give us
python dot PDF
okay
and we'll check the name
okay the p is capital four
python
and after that we have client dot run
that set
so we'll save this and first we'll kill
our terminal
and click on the Run button
so you can see that we have logged in as
project
and now we'll move back to our board so
our board is active and we'll start with
the high command
so it says hello and if we write High
board
then also it says hello that is if our
message contains high then the board
will be respond with hello and if we ask
him the image
he'll respondus with the image and if we
ask him with the video
it takes time like there's the video is
a bit larger in size
okay
so it doesn't have any attribute video
that is python node and before we quote
an error here
MP4
just check
yeah
this is the same file
where I should not have been occurred
okay
we have asked for the video
okay there it is
we have written start with it starts
with
that's why I responded for image but not
for video
audio and the file
now we'll save this and first will kill
the terminal and run the code again
we can see the session ID and it has
logged in
now we'll move back to our project and
now we'll ask the board for video
now we'll see what it responds
yeah you can see that it has responded
with the video you can also play it here
and if we ask for
image
and gives us the Divine image
and if we ask for the audio
it has shared the audio that is
beautiful underscore mistakes and we ask
for the file
please
so I think we got
any error
that is going to start with file
and we have python PDF and the error is
payroll too large okay the request
entity is too large
so we have not subscribed with the Nitro
version so we can just send the 8mb
files we will just
check what is the size
okay it's of 9 MB so it won't show
so you can place any file that is less
than 8 MB your board would respond for
that
and
with that we are done with the bot and
we are ready we are with the boat
and with that we have come to the end of
this session and I have an insightful
