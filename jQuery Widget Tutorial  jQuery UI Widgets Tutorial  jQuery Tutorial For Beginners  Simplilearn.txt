hello everyone and welcome to simply
learns youtube channel caution this side
and i hope you guys are doing well today
we are going to discuss widgets in
jquery ui
we'll start this video with an
introduction to widgets and then we'll
cover certain widgets like the date
picker widget the accordion widget and
many more so before we begin let me tell
you guys that we have regular updates on
multiple technology videos so if you are
a tech geek in a continuous hunt for the
latest technological trends then
consider getting subscribed to a youtube
channel and press that bell icon to
never miss any updates from simply learn
so without any further delay let's get
started
before we move on to the date picker
widget in jquery let's discuss what a
widget is
in simple terms a widget is an
application or a component of an
interface that enables a user to perform
a function or access a service
suppose you use any android or ios
device then you must have noticed the
feature of widget that allows the user
to do certain things without opening the
actual app
for example mobile phones have widgets
that help us play music or know about
the weather outside or maybe some
particular apps sometimes have the
option to use them with the help of
widgets only
similarly jquery ui has some predefined
widgets that allows us to do specific
tasks with less amount of code needed
the date picker widget helps us in
picking the date from the calendar
an example of this date picker widget is
when we try to make any travel booking
and it asks the user to pick a date
within which they want to travel
then on clicking the tab we get the
calendar to pick up a date
that calendar refers to the date picker
widget
let me take you through the widget from
the official website of jquery ui and
you guys will understand it much better
here you can see we are on the website
and if you can see here we have
different interactions and widgets over
here
if we click on the date picker widget
from here so this is the date picker
widget if we click on it
you can see we have an input box over
here and the date is written here right
you can see date written over here
now on clicking the input box here we
have a calendar to pick a date from it
pick up any date from it and we have the
date as input in the text box right so
we'll create this text box and use this
widget in today's video you can also
check the source code from the website
if you want to but let's create the
whole thing again here
fine
so we'll move back to a
vs code and we'll open this document for
now
now we'll create a container box for
this first and then we'll put an input
box inside it the task is easy so we'll
move to html file and we'll write here
div
id is equals to let's say div one
and here we have a container now let's
style this tag a bit so that it can be
visible properly so what we'll do is
we'll move to a head section
and we'll style this div tag over here
only we'll use the style tag
we are not going to create any external
css file for this so inside this we'll
write
hash
div one so this is the id of a container
then inside here we'll write height
height is going to be let's say
500 pixels fine then we'll write here
width
and width is again going to be 500
pixels
then we'll give the border as well so
we'll write here border and border is
going to be three pixels
black in color and let's say solid fine
so we are going to write here solid and
then we'll define the border radius as
well to make it look more attractive so
border radius is going to be let's say
25 pixels
and then we'll write here position
and position is going to be relative
then the last thing we are going to
write here is the margin margin is going
to be auto
save it
and we have a box over here at the
center of our web page if you
open the browser completely you can see
over here we have a box so for now what
we'll do is we'll reduce the size from
here so instead of 500 pixels
let's say we have a box of size 200
pixels fine we'll define the width as
well so save it now you can see we have
a box over here the box looks a bit
smaller we can say so we'll again change
the height and width we'll write here
300 for height and 300 for width save it
now and it looks fine now
so let's move on and we'll add an input
box inside this container now for that
what we'll do is we'll write here inside
the div tag we'll use the paragraph tag
and then we'll put date inside it then
after date we'll put the input tag
inside the paragraph tag and input type
is going to be
text
and let's give the id as well so let's
say the id is date for this input tag
and we'll write here placeholder as well
so let's say inside here we'll write
enter
date fine we have to close this input
tag and we are good to go save it now
and you can see we have an input box
over here inside the container
fine
so let's make some style changes to make
it look more appealing so what we'll do
is we'll style this paragraph tag we'll
style the whole paragraph text so
we'll write here p and then inside it
will write text align is
center we want
the text to be present at the center of
the box
margin top is going to be let's say 150
pixels we want the text box in the
center of this container so margin top
is 150 for that
then we'll write here let's say font to
it fine we'll write here bolder
save it now and you can see we have the
input box at the center of this
container
so what we can do here is we can put a
space between this and save it now you
can see it looks fine now
now we are done with the html and css
part we are doing all this so that you
can stay in touch with html and css and
it will also make the learning part
easier for you guys so let's move on to
the jquery ui part now and we'll add the
date picker widget to this input box
over there only
so we'll move to a javascript file and
what we'll do here is we'll add the date
picker widget to our input box so for
that we'll write here
dollar we are again going to access this
particular input box so for that we have
the id as
date
we'll write here dot
then we'll write here
date picker
fine
we are done with it can you guys believe
that we don't even have to write so much
code to add this widget
one line and we are done
save the program and click on the input
box now you can see we have a calendar
over here we can select any date from
here and the date will appear inside the
box you can see we have 12 1 20 21
fine
the date format here will be month day
and year which is mmdd and yy
fine and the date will appear inside the
text box only the good thing about this
date picker widget is that we can
control it for example you can see here
that the month of december starts from 1
fine
and there are no values present before
that month so what we want is we wanted
to show the dates from the previous
months as well for that what we can do
is we can write here inside this we have
to put curly braces over here and then
inside these curly braces we'll write
here
show other months so we'll write here
show other
months so this is case sensitive guys so
keep this syntax in mind we have to
write here show with small s and then
other with capital o and months with
capital m we'll write here true
and save it now click on the input box
and you can see we have the dates over
here as 28 29 and 30. fine
however we can't select these dates
right now
for making them available for selection
what we have to do is we have to write
here after a comma we have to write here
select
other months
fine
now pass this as true
save the program click on the input box
try to select 29 from here and you can
see it says 11 29 20 21
fine
we can also show the button bar over
here beneath the calendar
so for that what we have to do is we
have to write here
after a comma show
button
panel and we have to pass this boolean
as true
save it now
click on the input box and you can see
we have two buttons over here one is
today and the other one is done
fine
one of the button will take us to the
current date for example if we are in
the month of march if we click on this
today button you can see we are here
back in december and if you are done
selecting the date
then you can click on this done button
over here this widget has some more
functionalities like we can also show
the menu for changing the months and
years as you can see here for now we
have to go to other months with the help
of these arrow buttons only what we can
do is we can pass the boolean options
and the value will be set to true for
change months and change you
so let's do it here what we'll do is
we'll write here after comma change
month
and we are going to pass it
true
and we are going to write here change
here as well fine
value is going to be true again
save it now click on the input box and
you can see here we have the menus for
months and years here
we can choose any month from this list
let's click on july and here we are in
the month of july 2021. similarly we can
choose years as well
we have years till 2031 from 2011. fine
now widget functionalities makes it
easier for the user to choose any date
from the given dates we can also
restrict the years according to our
needs
so if we want to restrict the ears
according to our need we have to write
here
mind date and we have to pass the date
here we'll write here
new and then we'll write here date
then we'll write here the year so let's
say we are writing here 2016
1 comma 5
and then we'll write here
max date fine
we'll use the same syntax we'll write
here new date and let's say we are
writing here 2023
then we'll write here comma 1 comma 6.
fine so we have an error over here we'll
remove it and we are good to go
fine the format will remain the same for
year month and day numbers in the
programming start from zero so january
will be zero a calendar will allow us to
choose between february 5 2016 and
february 6 2024
all the other dates will either be
removed or not available for selection
so save it now
click on the input box and if you try to
click here in 2021 you can see we have
2016 as the first option we'll click on
2016 and you can see we don't have the
month of january in the year 2016
because the numbers start from zero
and we have written here one so the
calendar will start from february 2016.
inside here we can't choose these dates
we can start from fifth february 2016
only fine
we can show more than one month at a
time as well so what we can do here is
we can write here comma
number of months so we'll write here
number of
months and we'll pass here let's say
2. fine
now we can select any date from two
months so click on the button over here
and let's
increase the size of this chrome browser
save this program now
click on the input box and you can see
we have two months over here we have
december 2021 and january 2022
fine so these are the functionalities
the date picker widget can perform the
list is quite long and we can't discuss
all of these functionalities so you guys
can check them by going through the
official jquery ui website i want you
guys to go through them and let us know
if there is any crucial functionality we
left out
a tooltip is basically a message which
appears when a cursor is positioned over
an icon image hyperlink or other
elements in a web page
so let's go through the jquery website
once and we'll see what this widget
actually does
here is the website of jquery ui we have
seen the usage of the datepicker widget
from this website and we are well aware
of this website by now
so let's quickly go through the tooltip
widget and then we'll start using the
widget in our own program
what we'll do is we'll go to widgets and
will look for the tool tip widget here
you can see here at the bottom this tool
tip widget click on it and it will take
us to another web page
now here we have a text box and on
hovering over the text box you can see a
box with some text present inside it
which says we ask for your h only for
statistical purposes
this is known as the tool tip widget in
jquery ui
where we can use this widget any idea
guys
now imagine we are working on an
e-commerce website where we have certain
different types of products and what we
can do is
we can use this tool tip over our
products it will look nice right it will
give the user a bit of information about
the product and the website will look
more interactive
this was just an example of where we can
use this widget so let's use this widget
in our program now
what we'll do is we'll use the same code
from the previous video with an input
box present inside a container
so let's make some changes over here in
the html part first
we'll add an attribute over here we'll
add the title attribute so let's write
the code again we'll write this code
again
what we'll write here is
we'll again use the p tag because we
have styled the p tag already we'll
write here name
then we'll put some space and after this
we'll write here input
type is equals to text
and then we'll write here id is equals
to let's say
tool
and finally we'll write here title let's
say title is
enter your name here fine
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to use a placeholder and
inside this will write enter name
and will close this input tag now
fine
the same task but we change the name and
edit the title attribute here this title
attribute is a default html attribute so
if you save this program for now and you
can see here on taking the mouse cursor
over the input box a small message
appears on the screen so this tool tip
is actually very basic this is the
default html tool tip
now the next thing we'll do is to use
the tooltip widget we'll use the jquery
ui tooltip widget we'll move to a
javascript file and we'll try to access
this input box with the id first so here
is a javascript file and what we'll do
here is we'll try to access this input
box over here so for that we'll write
here dollar and then we'll use the id so
the id is
tool and then we'll write here dot
tool tip
fine
this is a method we'll
use brackets over here so that's it the
tooltip widget will take care of the
rest save the program move to the
browser and you can see here if we take
our cursor to this input box we have a
message over here so this tooltip is a
bit different from the html one right
the tooltip is larger in size and it's a
bit different as well
so what we can do is we can also make
customizations to this widget we can
control the effects and animation of
this widget by giving several boolean
parameters and by setting their values
for example we can track the mouse
cursor here and the tooltip will move
along with the mouse cursor just a
single property we have to give and we
are good to go so let's do it here and
you guys will understand it much better
what we'll do is we'll use curly braces
over here and then inside here we'll
write
track and we'll pass the value as true
fine
save the program move to the browser and
you can see it on the browser that the
tool tip tracks the mouse cursor and the
box is moving along with the cursor
right you can see the box moving
it moves to either of the sites along
with the cursor of a mouse now if you
see here carefully the animation here is
the fade in and fade out by default you
guys can see the tooltip fading in and
out on taking the mouse cursor over the
input box and on taking it away from
here
now the next thing we can do with this
widget is we can control the animation
of this widget
so we have two parameters to control the
animation which are the show and the
height property
both the properties can take multiple
parameters like the timestamp
delay and the type of effect we want so
let's say if we write here
after a comma
so let's say we write here
show
and then we have to use curly braces
because we have to pass multiple
parameters over here inside here what
we'll do is we'll write here effect
and the effect is going to be let's say
slide down fine this is a predefined
effect present in jquery ui already
and we don't have to do anything else we
just have to write the name of the
effect and jquery ui will take care of
the rest
now here we'll write
duration
and the duration is going to be let's
say 2000 fine then we'll also write here
delay as well so
we'll write here delay and delay is
going to be let's say 250
fine slide down here is the effect and
the duration defines the time this
effect will take place for delay here is
the time taken before the effect starts
taking place if you want to check the
output save the program go to the
browser and will move a cursor inside
the input box you can see the change in
the animation the
tooltip is sliding down on taking the
mouse cursor to this input box and if we
take it away from here the tooltip fades
out right so you can see the animation
it takes certain time to appear and then
it
suddenly goes out if we take the mouse
cursor away from the input box fine
now we can change the effects as well we
have several effects present like we
have highlight we have pulsate and we
have bounce as well so let's use some
more effects here what we'll do is we'll
change the slide down to
let's say highlight
fine
now the tooltip will get highlighted for
some time save the program
and move to the browser you can see here
on taking the mouse cursor to the input
box we have the tooltip highlighted for
some time
right another tooltip effect we have in
jquery ui we have the pulsating effect
as well what we can do is we can write
here pulsate in place of highlight so
this is another effect we have in jquery
ui save the program and now the tooltip
animation will change you can see on
taking the mouse cursor the tooltip is
pulsating right
so let's move ahead and we'll now see
the height feature as well
we want some animation in the end as
well so when we take the mouse cursor
away basically
for that what we can do is we can define
another property over here we can write
here
height and
the syntax will remain the same for hide
as well because we have to pass several
parameters that's why we are using
curly braces over here effect we will
write here as
let's say
explode fine
then we'll write here duration as well
duration is going to be
let's say two 2000 fine let's remove the
delay from here as well because we don't
want any delay in a tooltip animation
save the program now take your mouse
cursor over this input box and you can
see the pulsating effect here now take
it out and you can see the explode
effect is not working so we have to
remove this l from here save it now
now try to do it you can see the
pulsating effect here and on taking the
mouse cursor away you can see the
tooltip exploding into pieces here
now one more thing we can do here is we
don't actually need the whole title
attribute to use the tool tip what we
can do is we can use this tool tip
without the attribute value as well what
we can do is we can remove the value
from here
and let's say we are removing this value
from here so this is the value of our
tooltip basically now save the program
what we can do instead of it is we can
write here
content and let's write here something
so let's say we are writing here this is
the
place
for
name
fine we'll write here comma save it now
what actually happens is jquery ui
dynamically takes this value from
content and puts it inside this
title attribute
now this will work totally fine save the
program move to the browser and take
your cursor over this and you can see we
have the tooltip widget as this is the
place for name
and when we take the cursor away from
this input box you can see the tooltip
exploding into pieces
so these are the customizations we can
make in the tooltip widget in the jquery
ui the list of features is quite long so
you guys can check them by going through
the website the task for you guys now is
you have to put this tool tip over an
image and see the result let us know if
you face any sort of problem and will be
more than happy to help you guys
the accordion widget is mainly used for
descriptions or we can say it is a
jquery based expandable and collapsible
content holder that is broken into
sections and probably looks like tabs
only
so we have been through the syntax of
the previous two widgets we discussed
there's not too much of a difference so
let's quickly go through the
introduction of this widget from the
jquery ui website and then we'll use it
in our program so here we are on the
official website we'll quickly go
through the accordion widget so here is
the widget you can see the first widget
present is the accordion widget click on
it
and we can see we have some sections
over here right we have section one we
have section two three and four if we
click on any of the sections here like
if we click on section two you can see
this section expands and we can go
through the description of that
particular section
so let's try to achieve this thing by
ourself and then we'll see the
customizations allowed in the accordion
widget so we'll move to the vs code and
first of all what we'll do is we'll add
some sections over here along with the
description only
so
here is the output of this particular
document for now what we'll do is we'll
add some particular sections over here
so we'll write here
div let's say the id for this div tag is
div one fine so here is our div tag now
inside this what we'll do is we'll add
some headings and the description part
right so we'll write here let's say h2
and inside this we are writing let's say
html
now what we'll do is we'll create
another div tag and then inside this div
tag we'll write p and now we'll write
something about the html fine so we'll
write here let's say html
stands for hyper text markup language
and then we'll write here let's say it
is used
to structure
a web page fine
so let's write something more here and
we'll write here and it's
content fine
save the program you can see it over
here we have a heading as html and then
we have a paragraph which is html stands
for hyper text markup language and it is
used to structure a web page and its
content fine i hope you guys got this
so now what we'll do is we'll copy this
piece of code from here and we'll paste
it again
fine we have pasted it four times we'll
change the headings and the paragraphs
as well so let's say we are writing here
css then we'll
write here let's say we are writing here
css stands for
cascading style sheet
and right here it is used
to
style a web
page in different phase fine
save it and you can see here we have
some headings and some text below them
you can see it over here it says css
stands for cascading style sheet it is
used to style a web page in different
ways similarly we'll change these two as
well so
let's do it first we'll write here
javascript and then we'll write here
let's say
javascript
crypt was introduced
in the year 2 1995
and then we'll write here
it is used to add functionality fine
i hope you guys must know all of this by
now so we have been through all this
already now the last thing we are going
to do is we are going to write here
jquery fine
then we'll
write here inside this paragraph tag
we'll write here jquery was
jquery was introduced in 2006 so we'll
write here jquery was introduced in 2006
and let's say we are writing here jquery
is in
open source
fast
tiny and
rich
feature
library fine
and
that's it we are not writing anything
more because this is just for
illustration purposes so we'll save this
and here you can see we have all the
four headings we have html css
javascript and jquery
so this is the html part we are done
with it now let's use the accordion
widget to make this ok looking web page
a bit attractive so we'll use the widget
only we'll move to a javascript file
here we are in the javascript file and
we'll write here inside this
let's say
now we want to access the whole division
right so we want to access this
particular division with id as d1 so
we'll write here dollar and then inside
double inverted commas we'll write
div one this is the id then we'll write
here dot
accordion fine
this is a method so we'll use brackets
over here
that's it guys we are done with it save
the program and you can see how nice
this thing looks now we don't have to
put any effort into adding functionality
to this web page a single line of code
can do this task for us so this is the
actual use of jquery ui it allows us to
do certain tasks with a single line of
code
now the first section always remains
open like this
and if you want to make it collapsible
like you can see we can click on any of
these sections now and that particular
section will expand but if you refresh
this page and you can see it over here
the first section always remains open
now what if we want to make it
collapsible we don't have to do so much
of a task what we have to do is we have
to pass some properties and jquery ui
will take care of the rest
now what we'll do is we'll write here
inside the brackets we'll use curly
braces over here and now we'll write
here
collapsible and we'll pass it as
true fine
now save the program and you can see if
we click on this html again you can see
it collapses on clicking it so this
property is working totally fine and it
allows us to
make a section collapsible or expandable
fine
jquery ui helps us do such tasks without
any problem so what else we can do here
is we can change the icons as well here
you can see that we have these arrow
shaped icons over here
in the header part if you guys remember
jquery ui has some predefined css
properties or we can say it has some
predefined css libraries as well through
which we can also change the style so
let me show you the icons we have in
jquery ui and for that we'll go back to
the website here are the icons we can
use any of the buttons from here you can
see the names we don't have to do so
much of a task you can see the icon type
you can see it over here it's written
that ui icon arrow 1n so these are the
names for these particular icons we can
use any of these icons we don't have to
do much of a task we have to copy the
names from here and we have to paste
them into a javascript file so let's
move back to a jquery file once and
first of all we'll write the property
over here we'll write here
icons and this is a little bit tricky we
can say we have to use curly braces over
here
and inside this we have to write header
we are going to use different icons for
header and for
active header so we'll write here header
and we'll take one icon from here fine
will let's say we are taking this ui
icon caret one so we'll copy the name
from here we'll paste it in a jquery
file
then we'll write here comma we'll again
do the same thing for active header as
well so we'll write here active
header
and then we'll take one more icon so
let's say we are taking this icon from
here
copy it from here paste it here and we
are good to go fine
so this is how we can change the icons
using jquery ui now let's go through the
output once
save this program and you can see the
icons are changed now we have these
icons over here so let me comment this
property for once save it now you can
see these were the icons we had before
we are using the icons property now
after using this property save it and
here you can see the icons are changed
fine
so this is how we can change the icons
using jquery ui
so some more customizations we can make
in this widget are
we can also change the time for the
animation to take place using the
animate property
now we don't have to do so much of a
task for that we'll
use a comma here and we'll write here
animate will pass the time in
milliseconds so let's say we are writing
here 2000 save it and now the animation
will take two seconds to complete you
can see the change in the speed here it
takes two seconds to expand and two
seconds to collapse fine
we can also change the event from click
to mouse over as well so
for that we have to write here
after a comma we have to write here
event and then we can write here let's
say
mouse over i hope this will work so the
default event is the click event and we
can change the event using this event
property only
so
let's save this program and if we take
our mouse cursor over any of these
sections you can see that particular
section expanding and collapsing
with the mouse cursor right you can see
the mouse over event working over here
so these are some basic customizations
we can make in the accordion widget in
jquery ui the list is so long and we
can't discuss all the properties
so you guys can go through them from the
official jquery ui website and let us
know if we missed out on anything
important now that we are aware of what
widgets are and we know a lot about them
from the previous few widgets we have
been through till now
we know quite a bit about them and their
usage right so widgets make it easier
for us to do certain things without
writing much of a code
now the message box we are talking about
here is a message kind of thing that
appears on the screen and it looks more
attractive than the traditional alert
method
we can also customize the box with some
properties and make a webpage look more
interactive to the user the actual
widget name is dialog it's not message
box actually the widget name is dialog
and the work of this widget is to put a
message on the screen inside a
particular message box
so let's go through the jquery ui
website quickly and will then use this
widget in a program
here we are at the official website of
jquery ui and we'll quickly move to the
dialog widget to know more about it so
here you can see this is the dialog
widget click on it and you can see it
over here we have a dialog box with some
message on it right so this is the
dialog box over here it has a heading
which says basic dialog and inside this
we have some content over here
right
now if we take the mouse cursor over the
title you can see the cursor changes and
we are now able to drag this widget
across the screen fine
or we can also change the size of this
widget with the help of our mouse you
can see the size changing if we try to
change it if we try to increase the size
or if we try to reduce the size we can
do it with the help of this widget
now you can also go through the
customizations allowed in the dialog box
from the website only but let's use this
widget in our program and we'll see some
customizations there only here we are in
the vs code now there are two simple
steps to get the jquery dialog box
we can either place the content inside
the div element and then we can access
the content from there or we can just
use the dialog function in our
javascript file as well for now we'll be
using the first method in which we'll
create a division and add some content
inside it so let's do it here
what we'll do is we'll write here inside
this body tag we'll write here div and
we have to provide an id so let's say
the id for the div is dialog
we'll close this and here we are
now we'll write something inside this
div tag so let's say we are writing here
this is a customizable
dialog box fine so this is our text save
the program and you can see it over here
we have the text as this is a
customizable dialog box on the browser
now what we want to do is we want the
content of this div element inside the
dialog box for that
we'll move to a javascript file so this
is a javascript file and we'll write
here
dolo we'll try to access this div tag so
we have the ids dialog we'll write a
hash
dialog then we'll write here dot
so the widget name is dialog so we'll
write here dialog and that's it
now the dialog widget will take the
content from the div element dynamically
and put it inside as a message
save the program and you can see here we
have a message box with the same message
as the content from the div element you
can see this message box over here has
no title as of now although we can
drag this message box in a web browser
or we can also resize it you can see it
over here now to add the title we have
two ways first we can either use the
title attribute in the html development
or we can use the title property here
inside the dialog function only
so let's give it a try what we'll do is
we'll move to html file and we'll use
the title attribute over here so we'll
write here title and let's say the title
is
title using attribute
fine
save it and you can see we have the
title over here as title using attribute
now we can also use the title property
as well so for this we'll move to a
jquery file or javascript file we can
say and then we'll write here inside
this dialog function we'll use curly
braces and we'll write here title
then we'll pass the title here so let's
say the title is
title using
property fine
for now we have the title as title using
attribute because we are using an html
attribute for the title so
save this program now and you can see
the title changes to title using
property fine
i didn't remove the title attribute from
the html file to let you guys know that
the title property here will overwrite
the title attribute if it ever gets into
a situation where we have used both of
them
so i hope you guys got this now the next
customization we can do is we can change
the dragging of this message box right
now we are able to move this message box
within the browser you can see it over
here we are free to move it so to stop
the user from doing this we have to set
the draggable property to false
so what we can do is we can write here
after a comma
draggable
and we have to set this property to
false all the properties here are by
default set to true mostly so we have to
set it to false save the program and now
try to move this box you can see we are
not able to move this box now
so this is how the draggable property
works
although the size can still be changed
with the help of mouse cursor only we
can change the size of this
dialog box so to stop this from
happening what we have to do is we have
to write here
resizable
and we have to pass this property as
false fine save it now and
you will notice that we are not able to
resize this dialog box now so these are
some of the basic properties of this
dialog widget now we'll further move on
and we'll see some more properties over
here
now the following property is close on
escape
so if you press the escape key from the
keyboard you can see the message box
closes if we set the close on property
to false then it will not allow us to
close the dialog box by pressing the
escape button this is one more property
of the dialog widget so what we have to
do is
we have to write here after a comma
close on
escape fine we have to set this to false
and we are good to go save it now and
press the escape key from the keyboard
and you can see we are not able to close
this dialog box by using the escape key
anymore
for the next property let's add an input
box first we'll see why in a moment so
let's add it first we'll move to html
file and we'll write here before the div
tag so let's say we are writing here
first
name and we'll use an input tag so we'll
write here input
type is equals to text
and that's it
fine
save the program you can see we have the
input box on the browser you can see we
have it over here
the reason behind adding it is to show
you guys that if we try to interact with
an element while the dialog box is there
on the screen jquery will not stop us
until we use the model property so if we
try to write here any name so you can
see we are able to do that and we have
the message over here as well
now to make this dialog box a model
dialog box what we have to do is we have
to pass the model property to true here
fine we have to make the
dialog box as a model dialog box so we
have to write your model and we have to
pass here true save the program and now
you can see we cannot access the input
box anymore if we try to click over here
you can see we are not able to do
anything with this input box
so what we have to do is we have to
close this dialog box first so let's
close it and now we'll try to write
something inside this input box you can
see we are able to write anything over
here
right now you guys might wonder that
this dialog box is opening every time
right
what if we want to open it on a button
click for that what we have to do is we
have to set the auto open property to
false first and we have to add a button
as well so let's start by adding a
button and then we'll set the auto open
property to false
we'll add a button over here so what
we'll do is we'll write here after this
input element
we'll write here button we have to pass
an id over here so let's say the id is
btn1
and the name of this button is let's say
dialog box fine save it now and you can
see we have a button over here named as
dialog box now the next thing we are
going to do is we are going to set the
auto open property to false so for that
we'll move to a javascript file and
we'll write here
auto
open
fine and we'll set this property to
false
save the program and you can see the
message box is not opening by default
anymore now to open the dialog box on
the button click we have to access the
button first and then we have to use the
open method seems a bit confusing right
so let's try to do it and you guys will
understand it much better i guess
so what we'll do is
we'll write here before this
dialog box so we'll access the button
first so we'll write here dollar the
button id is
btn1 then we'll write here dot click we
are using the click event we will create
a function over here
and now inside the body of this function
what we have to do is we have to open
the dialog box for that we'll write here
dollar
we'll again write here
dialog because we want the content from
the div element for the dialog box then
we'll write here dot
dialog fine now we'll right here inside
this open
and that's it
we have to pass the open method here as
a string because we want to open the
dialog box on a button click now save
the program
and
you guys can see here we have to click
on the button over here to open the
dialog box click on the button you can
see on clicking the button the dialog
box is opening and we are not able to
write anything still here right we are
not able to write any name over here for
that we have to close this and then we
will be able to write here anything
and for the dialog box to appear we have
to click on this dialog box button
so guys these are some of the
customizations we can make in this
particular widget i hope you guys got
this you can go through some more
customizations from the official jquery
website
one of the most accessible and widely
used widgets in jquery ui is the
autocomplete widget it helps the users
complete the text they are writing in an
input box or somewhere by giving
suggestions
so let's go through the jquery ui
website quickly and then we'll see the
syntax and all for this particular
widget so here we are on the website
we'll look for the autocomplete widget
and here is the autocomplete widget
click on it
now you can see we have a text box over
here so before we do something let's go
through the description given over here
for this autocomplete widget it says the
autocomplete widgets provides
suggestions while you type into the
field here the suggestions are the tags
from programming languages so if we
write here let's say ja
you can see we have two different
options we have java and javascript
right so this is what the autocomplete
widget is now let's use this widget in
our program
so here we are in the vs code what we'll
do now is we'll create an input box
first and then we'll use this particular
widget so for creating an input box what
we'll do is we'll write here let's say
we are writing here
favorite
language
fine
now we have to create an input box for
this so we'll write here input
type is equals to text
and let's provide the id as well so
we'll write here id so let's say the id
is
input for this text box
now let's add a button over here as well
to make it look nicer a bit so what
we'll do is we'll add a button over here
we'll write here button
so let's say we'll give the id as ptn1
we don't need this but let's do it here
so let's say the button name is submit
now save the program and you can see it
on the browser we have an input box
where we have to mention our favorite
language and a submit button as well
so let's move on to the jquery part now
and we'll use the autocomplete widget
here we are in the javascript file now
the syntax is the same so we have to use
this widget with the id of a html
element what we'll do is we'll write
here
dollar so the id for input box is input
so we'll write here hash input then
we'll write here dot auto
complete fine
that's it right the syntax for all the
widgets we have been through is similar
to this one but there is a slight
difference in this particular widget
what this widget does is it provides us
with suggestions so we have to give
those suggestions by ourselves to the
system to let jquery ui go through them
and then only it can provide us with
certain recommendations
the suggestions will be the name of some
languages in this particular case so
let's create an array over here of all
the languages we want what we'll do is
we'll write here before this
document.ready method or event we can
say
we'll create a variable over here so
let's say the variable name is language
then we'll create an array so
let's say we have certain
names of particular languages stored
inside this array right so we'll write
here html
then we have
css
we have javascript as well so we'll
mention all the languages we know we'll
write a javascript then we have
php and
we have java
so then we'll write here
python and
then we'll write here
let's say
c
we have c plus plus as well so we'll
mention that as well so we'll write here
c plus plus then we have
c sharp so we'll write here c sharp and
we have pearl so we'll write here pearl
will write here
so we have to put this inside double
inverted commas
then we'll write here let's say ruby
and we have
scala so we'll write scala
then we have cobol as well
so these all are languages
then we have basic
so we'll write a basic and
let's mention some more so let's say we
are writing here
fortran so we'll write here fortran
and then we have
lisp
and finally let's add here typescript
fine so we'll write here typescript
i guess these are enough for now
so the next task we have to do is to let
the autocomplete widget know about this
particular array for that we have to
pass this array as a parameter to this
autocomplete widget over here fine
now the thing to keep in mind here is
that we have to pass two parameters in
this widget
one is for the source of the array we
can say and the other one is for the
customizations so we have to pass them
inside curly braces this means that we
have to use two pairs of curly braces
right so we'll use two curly braces over
here we'll separate them with a comma so
the first one is for the source and the
second one is for the customizations
fine
now the next thing we have to do is to
pass the source to this autocomplete
widget
the source is the array right for that
what we have to do is we have to write
here inside this first curly braces we
have to write here source
and we have to give the name of a array
over here so we'll write here language
and that's it
fine
we are done with the autocomplete widget
so let's check the output now
save the program and move on to the
browser here we have an input box now
try to write something over here what
we'll do is we'll write here let's say
c you can see we have the names of all
the languages which have the letter c
present in their names
this is the basic working of this
autocomplete widget it suggests all the
related names to the user and lets them
choose from any of them so if we click
on c plus plus you can see we have the
input sc plus plus over here and if we
write here
java we have two options we have
javascript and java we can click on any
of them and that will be present as the
text inside the input box
now we can also use the array inside the
auto complete widget as well we don't
have to create any variables or anything
just copy the array from here
and what we have to do is we have to
paste it here inside the
autocomplete widget fine will comment
this piece of code will comment it out
save it now and you can see on writing
here c we have all the options with c
present in their names fine so this is
working totally fine i guess
now talking about the customizations we
have in this widget we'll be going
through three different types of
customizations
what we'll do is we'll write here first
so we have this pair of curly braces
over here for the customization so we'll
write inside it let's say
delay
and let's
pass the value as 500 over here fine
delay is 500 means the suggestions will
be shown to the user after 500
milliseconds if we write here 2000
instead of 500
and save the program
now try to write something over here and
it will take two seconds to complete for
example let's say we are writing here
java now wait for two seconds and then
the options will appear on the screen
fine so this is a property of the
autocomplete widget now the second
property is the min length property this
property defines the minimum length
required for the suggestions
so for example if we write
here min length
and if we pass the value as let's say 3
save it now if we write here c
fine we have the min length as 3 and c
is of single letter will not get any
suggestions because the minimum length
is 3 instead of c if we write here
j a we are still not getting any
suggestions because the minimum length
is 3 right here v and you can see after
two seconds we have two suggestions over
here as java and javascript
let's change the delay to
500 over here again and now what we'll
do is we'll try to search for another
language let's say we are searching for
python now we have four
letters over here and you can see we
have the suggestion as python so this is
how the min length property of this
autocomplete widget works
now the last property is the autofocus
property let's go through the example
directly we'll write here after a comma
or to
focus fine we'll pass this as
true because this is a boolean property
save it now
now go to the browser and write here
something let's say we are writing here
kobul and you can see
we have the first option in focus
because of this particular property now
try to write here java
and you can see we have two options the
first one is in focus and if we pass
this property as
false
save this program right here java again
and you can see none of the two options
are in focus now
so these are some of the customizations
we have in the autocomplete widget now
the task for you guys is to dig a bit
deeper into this topic from the official
jquery website and let us know if we
missed out on anything
a widget is an application or a
component of an interface that enables a
user to perform a function or access a
service
this was the definition of widgets and
we know how to use certain widgets like
the date picker widget accordion widget
tool tip widget and many more such
widgets right so let's suppose a
scenario now wherein we are already
using a widget in our program and we
have customized the widget according to
our needs
now what we want is we want to change
the property of a widget by clicking on
a button
how we can achieve this thing we can't
write the whole thing again right
here comes the concept of widget
modification in jquery ui
what we need to do is we need to modify
a particular property of a specific
widget
is it possible in jquery to do so the
answer to this question is yes it is
possible to modify any widget property
in jquery with the help of specific
methods
let's go through the programming part
directly and you guys will understand it
much better
we'll use the dialog box widget and then
we'll try to modify a particular
property of that widget so let's write
the code again so that you guys can get
a fair idea of what's coming
what we'll do is we'll write here inside
the body tag we'll create a division so
for that we'll use the div tag the id is
going to be let's say
dialog for the dialog box
and we'll define the title here as well
so let's say the title of our dialog box
is going to be
title 1
we'll close the div tag now inside there
we'll write this is a customizable
dialog box fine
save the program
and you can see we have the text over
here which says this is a customizable
dialog box now we have to add the dialog
box for that we are going to use the
jquery ui widget but before that let's
add some buttons over here as well we'll
add two buttons because we have two
different properties so we'll write here
button and the id is going to be
btn1 for button one and the name is
let's say
get fine
we'll add another button for that we'll
write here button id is going to be btn2
and the name of this button is going to
be set
save this program and you can see we
have two buttons over here we have the
get button and the set button
now this is going to be a basic dialog
box the next thing we'll do is we'll
move to the jquery part and we'll write
some code there
so here we are in the javascript file
and what we'll do is we'll write here
dollar will access this whole division
so for that we'll write here hash
and id is dialog for the division then
we'll write here dot dialog
this is a method so we have to use
parentheses over here and then we'll use
curly braces to define all the
properties of this dialog box widget
now inside here we'll write properties
so let's say we are writing here
draggable
and we are passing this property as
true for now
then we'll write here
resizable and the property value is
going to be true again then we'll write
here
close on escape
we'll write here
true for this one as well
now the next property we are going to
use is the model property we'll write
here false for model
and then we'll use the auto open
property fine will write your auto open
and then we'll write here
true
and that's it
so what we are doing here is we are
defining the customizations allowed in
this particular widget i hope you guys
already have an idea of what we are
doing because we have discussed it in
the dialog box widget video
now save the program and you can see we
have a dialog box with title as title 1
and inside it we have a message which is
this is a customizable dialog box if you
try to drag this dialog box you can see
we are able to do that because we have
defined the draggable property to true
and we can also resize this because the
resizable property is also set to true
now what we want is we want to change a
particular property on a button click
right for that we have to use the click
event with the buttons so we'll use the
click event with buttons first and then
we'll use methods fine
so first of all we'll write here
dollar
the id for button one is btn1
which is
the get button then we'll write here dot
click
and we'll create a function over here
fine
and we have the body of this function
now inside this will write alert and
let's see if this button is working or
not we'll print a message so
we'll write here get is working
save the program click on the get button
you can see we have a message with get
is working as output now copy this piece
of code and we'll do the same thing for
set button as well we'll change the
button id to btn2
and instead of get will write here set
save the program click on set over here
you can see this button is also working
fine
so basically we were checking if these
buttons are working or not we'll comment
this piece of code for now
now the idea is to get the value of any
particular property and then change it
right for that we have two methods in
jquery ui the getter method and the
setter method
the getter method is used to get the
value of any particular property and the
setter method is used to change that
particular value
you can also go through the
documentation present on the jquery ui
official website but let me just tell
you about these methods the syntax for
the getter method goes like this
what we have to do is we have to take a
variable that will store the value so
for that we'll write here where model
let's say
then we'll access this dialog box we
have the ids dialog for that then we'll
write here dot
dialog and inside brackets we have to
pass two parameters one is the option
and
second one is going to be the name of
that particular property
so we'll write here option option refers
to these properties so basically we are
telling the computer that we want to
access these particular properties the
option parameter will remain the same
for all jquery widgets the second
parameter is going to be the name of a
particular property so let's say we are
writing here model
and on saving the program if we click on
the get button the output will get is
false because the model property is
initially set to false click on the get
button but before that we have to write
here some more things so what we'll do
is
we'll print the model variable inside
the alert method so we'll write here
alert model save this program click on
the get button you can see we have the
output as false because this is the
initial value of this model property now
let's move ahead and we'll try to change
this property to true now
for that we have the setup method in
jquery ui the syntax for setup method is
almost the same we'll copy this piece of
code from here
we'll paste it here inside this
and now what we'll do is we'll pass one
more parameter over here the third
parameter is going to be the change so
till now the value of this model
property is false but what we want is we
want to change it to true so we'll write
here true
save it now click on the get button you
can see the output is false click on ok
now click on the set button you can see
there is no change in the browser but
click on the get button again and you
can see the output is changed to true
this means that the model property is
now set to true fine
we can change any property by using
these methods so let's try this thing
with some other properties as well what
we'll do is we'll write here instead of
model let's say we are writing here
draggable fine
so the initial value of draggable was
true
what we'll do is we'll write here
draggable again and we'll change this to
false now
fine
save the program click on get you can
see the output is true because the
initial value of draggable property was
true
now click on set and you can see we are
not able to drag this dialog box anymore
right
this is because the draggable property
is now set to false when we clicked on
this set button click on get again and
you can see the property is false
so this is how the widget modification
in jquery actually works we can also
change the height and width of this
dialog box for that we have to define
the height and width over here let's
define them we'll write a height height
is going to be let's say
250 and we'll define the width as well
so the width is going to be let's say
250 again fine
so here we have the dialog box the
height and the width are 250 pixels we
can resize it obviously because the
recessible property is true now what we
want is we want the height so inside
this getter method will
right here height
and click on the get button after saving
this click on get you can see we have
the height as 250 pixels
now what we want is we want to change
the height right we'll write here height
again
now the new height is going to be let's
say 300 on clicking the set button
save the program click on get the
initial height is 250 fine click on set
you can see the change in the height
click on get again you can see the
height is changed to 300 pixels now
fine
so this is how we can make modifications
in the widgets afterward and this thing
remains the same for all the widgets in
jquery ui the name of the widget is the
only thing that will change rest
everything will remain the same
now the task for you guys is to use
these method with other widgets as well
and let us know if you find any
exceptions
and with that we come to the end of this
