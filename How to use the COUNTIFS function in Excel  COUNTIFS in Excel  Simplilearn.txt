areas of Interest now without further
delay let's get started with contests in
Excel now we are on the Excel
spreadsheet with a table based on employ
data set now we will try to apply
counters function in Excel based on this
data set so let's say we wanted to count
the number of employees for working in
development team so the formula is
completely similar to sufs and average
ifs but with a slight difference so
what's that
difference count
IFS so if you start the formula of
counters you can see the criteria range
has been given first not the return
value in sumf and average if you
actually get the return values first
then the condition then in case if it's
not one what do I let you to know right
but here you're given the criteria range
first right so that's the only
difference now let's try to build the
formula equals to count F count FS so
the criteria is Department value
department is equals to development
which is in cell I4 then count the
numbers now three now the second type of
uh requirement is the team member should
be from development and his designation
or her designation should be associate
now how do you modify the formula the
formula is completely same you just have
to add another condition over here or
add another parameter over here which is
like the same first one
Department comma value should be
development comma designation select the
designation column comma value should be
associate close the bracket enter now
you get one employee from development
team as an associate so that's how you
use CPS in Excel and if you have any
