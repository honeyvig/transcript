hey guys welcome back to another video
by simply learn in today's video we're
gonna be learning all about enumeration
in c but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our channel already make
sure to hit the subscribe button and the
bell icon to never miss an update
so now without any further delay let's
begin
this session will help you to understand
what enumeration in c is and next what
is enum used for
then let's understand the inum
declaration in c and finally let's
execute a simple program using enum
so now let's get started with what
enumeration in c is
enum is a user-defined data type
consisting of an integral constant in
short enum is a keyword that allows a
user-defined data type consisting set of
integral constants
the syntax is
inum enum name and list of constants
separated with the help of comma
operator
now let's see what is inum used for
so basically enum is used to allocate a
name to the integral constant
in the given below example we have enum
as a keyword
fruit as a user-defined data type
followed by enumerated constants mango
apple grapes and banana inside the curly
brackets
since this list of enumeration constants
comes under the category of fruits we
have fruits as a user-defined data type
which is possible with the help of the
keyword enum
all right
in c programming the compiler assigns
integer values to all the enumeration
constants by default
and that begins from
0
1 2
okay
so let us move on to the inum variable
declaration
here let us consider another example
where we have month as a user defined
data type and january february march
april may and june as constant
as discussed before by default the
compiler will assign values to the
constant it is even possible for the
user to assign new integer values to the
list of constants for example
the value 5 is given to the constant
match and the value 9 is assigned to the
constant zoom
then the compiler will automatically
assign values to the rest of the
constants that are starting from jan is
equal to 0 then fab is equal to 1 april
to 6 because it considers the previous
constant value plus 1 so that is 6 then
may as 7 again last value that is 6 plus
1 is equal to 7
and then comes the variable declaration
so as given below the variable m is
declared of the type month and this
variable can have only one value from
the listed enumeration constant
that is multiple values for a single
variable are not allowed
but we can also declare various variable
declaration for listed constants for
example
m1 comma m2 comma m3 and so on
next we can assign enumeration constant
to the variables like m1 is equal to
match and m2 is equal to april and etc
so now
m1 and m2 will hold an integer value 5
and 6 respectively
i hope you got a clear understanding of
the use of enum in c programming all
right
now let's execute a simple program using
enum
choose from over 300 in demand skills
and get access to 1 000 plus hours of

description to know more
so in this particular example we are
trying to print the integer value of
variable m and m1 we have already
assigned value 9 to the constant april
so now let's see the output
as you can see the output the value of m
is 2 so it's a default value assigned by
the compiler and the value of m1 is 9
assigned by the user
so with this we have come to the end of
this session on the enumeration in c
programming i hope this session was
informative and interesting until next
time thank you stay safe and keep
learning
