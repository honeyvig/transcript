hi everyone myself dr. Saeed mmds
conquer so today's topic for the MDS
finish line is on facial nerve and it's
applied aspects so the facial nerve is
actually very important if we shall
nerve and the trigeminal nerve with the
anatomy subject is very important for
the basics paper for almost all the
departments so first of all if it comes
as an essay or a short answer anything
should be started with writing the
contents okay if it is very short you
can avoid that writing the contents but
for the essay writing the contents part
is very important so these are the
contents that you can write for this
facial nerve so and in case if it comes
as an essay so this particular
discussion or this particular
presentation is how to write an essay
okay because they say is 20 mark so you
have write a bit lengthy so you can
write like this if it comes as a short
you have to cut short and you have to
write water exactly important okay so in
case if it comes in as an essay it's
better to write that all the facial
nerve or sorry all the other cranial
nerves and to let the examiner know that
you know all the cranial nerves as well
okay and amongst that you can highlight
the facial nerve to be 7th and you can
even highlight that it is both mixed but
that is it's both sensory and motors you
can highlight that it is make mixed
nerve and you can highlight that it is
7th grain you'll know
ok so I have to write the introduction
like it is a seventh cranial nerve and
it comes from the or ii drink a lot so
it's nerve of the second brain collage
also called as hired arch and it is
actually composed of around 10,000
neurons and 7,000 of which are
myelinated and in a way the nerves of
facial expression so you can write the
introduction like this ok so coming to
the development part you have to say
that we have to write that it is from
the second brain kale arch okay that's
very important so which supplies it's
both motor and the sensory components so
you can draw this diagram so diagrams
are equally important students because
they
have see no one has very good time to
read the entire lines that you write
okay you have to give importance to
headings and little important lines that
which are very important with that
particular topic and the diagrams if you
can put your diagrams in there
especially for anatomy like subjects
then it will score or it will be very
much scoring ok so here you can draw the
simple diagram and no need to write all
the other nerves where they here lies
the facial nerve right with the second
brain collage you can give or you can
highlight that the others if you can
draw it's even more useful but if you
can draw the facial nerve it can just
draw the outline and if you can
highlight the facial nerve then that's
more than enough actually but if you can
draw all the others also its scoring ok
it's based on your time while writing
the exam so next this is the time during
the general gist station when the
anatomical structures actually appear
with this cranial nerve that is seventh
cranial nerve so you have to write this
in order to increase the bulk of your
answer so if you can remember and write
this it's very it's very useful so write
the exact week of gestation and how the
structures are formed at that particular
week so you can have a look of this and
write so especially you can highlight
the 7th the week of gestation where the
geniculate ganglion which is a ganglion
for the seventh cranial nerve you can
highlight that and the last that is 12th
week of gestation the facial muscles are
formed so both these are very important
the others if you can just give a brief
for this that's more than enough but
have if this comes an essay and if you
can write this that will be very useful
so next coming to the nuclei which are
very very important for this facial
nerve so you have to keep the headings
of course and that thing will be
highlighted in your diagram but these
headings are important so these are the
four important nuclei with respect to
the facial nerve okay so here again you
can draw this small diagram if you can
so here you again you can write this
nucleus okay these nuclei the motor
nuclei of the cranial seventh cranial
nerve seven the supriya celebratory
nucleus and the lachrymatory nucleus
okay and the other one is attracted
solely Taurus which is on this side so
you can draw this diagram which is from
your show Russia so it's very important
okay so among in the pawns it is that
those nuclei there so you have to draw
those nuclei okay so simple no need to
draw this complex diagram for your
understanding I've put this diagram so
from the superior celebratory nucleus
comes a nerve which is called as nervous
intermedius and the postganglionic
fibers will go and it will be innovated
at the there you go palatine ganglion
okay from there the prick
sorry preganglionic fibers will
innervate the delica palatine ganglion
and from there the postganglionic fibers
will innovate the lacrimal gland under
to that of the hard and soft palates as
you can see here it innervate the
lacrimal gland and that of the hard and
soft palates so it is like this you have
to remember so we have to how to write
as preganglionic fibers innovate that
particular Daniel and postganglionic
fibers innovate the lacrimal gland and
the patterns of palates similarly there
is one more ganglion here
as you can see the submandibular
ganglion so preganglionic fibers will go
and innovate there and the
postganglionic fibers from the
submandibular gland will innovate the
submandibular and the sublingual gland
it is so simple okay and one more
important aspect related to the facial
nerve is its as per its taste it is for
the gustatory sensation or the taste
sensation for the anterior 2/3 of that
tongue so how does it do is it from the
nuclear that is nuclei sollett aureus
and from there
via geniculate ganglion which is a
ganglion of the seventh cranial nerve
comes called a tin pan in of this called
a timpani nerve as you can see will
innovate the anterior 2/3 of the tongue
just have a look of this diagram so that
you can have a better idea
okay so in short you can give this box
and you can nicely giver
like this you can draw a box and you can
give like what all inner weights and
what is
nuclear and all that so that will be
very useful it will be scoring so no
need to put on everything but whatever
you can put on there it's enough so
especially these three are very
important there's a solitary is the
nucleus solitarius nuclei and the motor
fibers which actually innovate the
facial muscles and then the visceral
motor so from the superior celebrated
nucleus especially to the lacrimal ZAR
mandibular and the sublingual gland so
these things you have to highlight this
box if you put in it will be good so
coming to the ganglion so now that we
have given the introduction we have
given the development and also we have
given the nucleus and the nerves that
come out of the nucleus and the
ganglions related so again one more
heading you can go for the ganglion so
what are the ganglions later to the
fashion of at these three ganglions so
you can give them again a little in a
brief description of those ganglion of
how how it works and all that okay you
can see here how would the was on so
geniculate ganglion we have seen the for
the sensory taste fibers and spin of
palatine and pet deliver palatine for
the lac leman and submandibular glands
will ganglion for the submandibular and
the sublingual glands okay the
parasympathetic set it on motor fibers
are to these glands so like that you can
write so again the Fae are the five
famous branches of the facial nerve you
have to highlight students so you can
see in this particular picture it
innervates the parotid gland and when it
comes outside it innovates of five it
has its five branches to which it
innervates the facial muscle so these
are the five branches as you can see
they include the temporal branches I go
to diagrammatic branch the the buccal
brands a marginal mandibular and the
cervical branch so like that you can
highlight
okay so again one more head thing you
can give it as a branches and
distribution so within the facial nerve
canal
are these the get greater petrosal nerve
two-step ideas and the quadrat in panic
at the exit from the stylo master
foramen are these three that is post
auricular digastric and the stylo heart
and again after innovating the parotid
gland the terminal branch
are these five so you can highlight like
this so this diagram which is they're
from shale Russia has to fall for the
facial nerve so you have to draw this
diagram so it's very simple you're
already well aware of this so you can
draw these three nuclei as we have
already discussed the lachrymatory and
the superior saliva tea nucleus a
nucleus tractus solitarius and the motor
nuclei and again you have to draw like
this exactly how it is you have to draw
so the sensory root vibrate the greater
petrosal it innervates the the lacrimal
gland and the terrible palatine ganglion
and all that and again via chorda
tympani it innovates a tongue and again
via it crosses and for the motor nucleus
again goes and gives it motor fibers to
the five branches so this diagram is
very important which is there in your
show Russia so you need to draw this
diagram so again after drawing this
diagram you can get that water all
nerves supplies to those specific
muscles if you again draw a box that
will be very useful okay so if you again
draw this box it will be very useful so
you can see what all nerve supplies to
those specific muscles it's simple the
name then then of itself has the muscle
name so you can write like that
so diagram if you follow the rest all
you can elaborate the answer so again
the vascular supply of the fashioner is
also equally important so intra cranial
e it is anti inferior several artery
within the facial canal and again
extract linearly so what are the
branches and what are the vascular
supply again to this facial nerve you
have to write okay
so this is a brief anatomy of the facial
nerve that you need to put in so you
have to write the nuclei you have to
write the branches of the facial nerve
okay and you have to draw the diagram
this is very important and the ganglions
associated with this so three headings
should be there the branches and the
nuclei as well as a ganglion associated
so all these if you put forward with a
beautiful diagram it's enough so
development diagram you can draw and
again the nucleus what are the nuclei
associated also you can draw so three
diagrams if you draw that's enough okay
then again you can elaborate the answer
of history
so the patient has come you have to take
the detailed history of all these which
are there next you have to do this
particular test like the shimmer test
since a fashion nerve innervates a
lacrimal gland the Shema test is only to
test the if there is any dryness of the
IOC octoman so you have to put a filter
paper in the eye and do and you have to
measure the wetness of the filter paper
okay like that the shimmer test is done
to check for syrup thal mia and also you
can check for the taste you can ask the
patient to taste something and whether
you have to differentiate whether it's
sweet or sore or something like that you
can ask him to do so and also the
celebrity flow you can test all these
you can do okay so so coming to the
various applied aspects so for any even
if any question for any Department
applied aspects is very important so we
know the main applied aspect related to
the fashion of Isabelle's pal say that
has to fall in okay so it should be like
it can be supranuclear or infra no clear
so what are the main differences of the
supranuclear you can see in this diagram
okay so you have to follow this so in
supranuclear so if it is before about
that there were the nucleus then the
lower part of the opposite side is being
paralyzed if it is in Freneau clear the
whole of the same side is paralyzed so
that you can see in this diagram okay
so next what are the reasons for the
facial nerve injury it could be trauma
either because of any forceps delivery
or penetrating the middle layer and all
that any bone fractures or what are the
Rays reasons for the facial paralysis
are all these it iatrogenic could be the
local anesthesia that causes the
transient facial paralysis and also the
parotid or mastered surgery so so this
diagram again if you put it in the
applied aspects that will be enough so
with the if the level of injury and the
symptoms shown so this is again from
your Chou Russia if you put in that will
be enough okay so draw this diagram as
well it will add on to your marks then
idiopathic reasons could be the Bell's
palsy them
consider simple syndrome and the heat
fort syndrome infections it could be
otitis media master writers Ramsay
Hansen Roman encephalitis so this if you
can put it's good the bilateral
conditions and then you didn't actually
conditions as you can see so these is
just the names if you can write that's
good and if it is and or medicine ro
path students then if you can give other
description of these syndromes that will
be again add padding to your point so
just have a look of these syndromes if
you can add some points to these like
for example may concern Washington
syndrome we know it's a trial right so
it has the colitis granulomatosis and
squirtle tongue as well as facial pulses
so like that if you add to every of
these conditions to each of these
conditions and it would be useful
so next Bell's palsy you can give the
definition that's enough so definition
is enough and where is this more common
that you can write it's enough and then
what is the etiology so you can write
these so clinical features of Bell's
palsy is very important so even if it is
transient facial nerve palsy it also
shows same clinical features so you have
to write these clinical features it's
it's enough if you write all these ok
ones if you see these and if you can go
through this person you can correlate
then it will be useful for you to
remember so that's it so you have to
start with the anatomy you have to start
with introduction you have to give a
brief of development or fort and then
you have to go into the anatomy of its
nuclear of its associated ganglion and
the branches and wherever required you
have to put in diagrams and then you
have to come to the history part of how
you take the history and what are the
tests you do and then you have to go for
the applied aspects where then you have
to write the facial pal see whether it's
in front of clear or supra or
supranuclear
and then you have to give the various
causes of or how the facial palsy can
occur and you can give the diagram of
the symptoms at which the part
the symptoms are shown if you draw the
diagram from your cherish it's it's
scoring and again the other
and bilateral conditions and if you put
more symptoms of the bell spells or
facial palsy freesias that's enough so
this is how you present the papers we
have to write the contents and to
conclude you have to write that anatomy
of the efficient of us is that most
important for a dental practitioner or
because it to go to perform any dental
procedures so like that you can conclude
so the conclusion is not that important
just you can conclude with one line or
two lines the main thing is a Content ok
the contents are headings and the
diagrams is important that's it so
references you can give your references
and wherever I have highlighted some
articles you can even write those
articles if you want
