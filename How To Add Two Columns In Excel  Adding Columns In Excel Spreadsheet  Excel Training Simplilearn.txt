let's get started with our one point
agenda that is how to add two columns in
excel
so first let us assume that we are
trying to add two columns in excel which
has textual kind of data this type of
data can be added using the concat
function which is a string concatenation
function in excel so type in concat
press tab key to select the function
the first cell that is a2 and next the
second cell that is v2 separated by
comma press enter and there you go now
you can see we don't have a space so you
can modify the formula
add space
double quotes
space
double quotes comma press enter
there you go now you can drag the same
formula across all the cells and you
have it now coming to the last column
where we literally have numbers right so
you can add two different numbers over
here
either you can select the first cell
that is d2 plus e2 and press enter and
you get the number or you can use the
sum function
tab to select and
one
two press enter
or another simplest way is select all
the blank output cells so these are the
cells where you are expecting an output
of two cells that is column entire
column d and entire column e right
now after selecting the blank cells of f
column or the resultant column press the
shortcut key that is alt equals to
so this is the shortcut method to call
the sum function and assign the cell
values of individual columns that is d
and e and get the resultant cell in f
column right so remember the shortcut
key that is alt e
now with that we have come to an end of

in excel or how to merge two columns in
excel so if you have any queries
