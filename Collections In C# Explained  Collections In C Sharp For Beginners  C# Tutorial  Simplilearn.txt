hey everyone i am bhabha khandelwal and
i welcome you all to simply launch
youtube channel
today we will be going over the
collections in c sharp but first let me
remind you that we have our daily
updates on numerous technologies so if
you are a tech geek looking for the
latest technological innovation then try
subscribing to our youtube channel and
don't forget to hit the bell icon so you
don't miss an update on simply run
so now without any further ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
session
we will begin our session with the
discussion on what are collections
then we will have a brief discussion on
types of collections
following that we will discuss generic
collections
and the non-generic collections with the
help of a demo
finally we will end this session with a
few pointers on collections
so
let's get started with the discussion on
what are collections
first
collection classes are specialized data
storage and retrieval classes
stacks queues list and hash tables are
all supported by these classes then
collection classes performs a variety of
functions such as dynamically allocating
memory to components
and retrieving a list by objects by an
index among others
at last
these classes construct
collections
of object objects
which serves as a foundation for all
data types in c sharp
next let's go over the types of
collections
they are majorly two types of
collections defined
first the generic collection
and the non-generic collection
let's discuss them in detail first we
have our generic collections
a generic collection is a class that
provides type safety without requiring
derivation from basic collection type
and the implementation of type specific
members the collection classes
are found in the namespace
system.collections.generics
internally generic collection store
elements in arrays of their respective
types
that is it can only have
if if the collection is of n-type then
it can only have elements of in-type
now there are several generic
collections available
first list
then we have dictionary
next sorted list
then we have stack
and finally queue
now let's go over the codes on each of
them
now
let's go over some general
functions first start with a genetic
list
here to declare a list we use less
end
and then the name for the list
then we use new
identifier
to start a new list
this is the basic syntax to create a
list
now to add a list we use an add function
so we are using gen list dot add to add
30 in this list and 60 then 90 then 120
after that we are using this for each
loop to print out this list
now let's print it
as you can see it has printed 30 60 90
and 120 just in the order we printed in
this list
let's close this
now
let's see dictionary
here we have this basic code for the
dictionary
to initialize the dictionary we use
keyword dictionary then in angular
records we define
the type
of both the parts of the dictionary one
is key and one is value
then we have dictionary name then we
again use new keyword
to finally start this dictionary
this is the basic syntax to create a
dictionary
then we have this function add to add
the data in the list note that we are
giving two values
one is
end which is given here as key
then we have here a string
now
we are using a foreign function where we
are
asking a key value pair
and naming it key y kyp
in this dictionary
key value pair means key and value pair
that is we are basically accessing both
the values together we can simply write
key here
key kyp in dictionary and we can get the
same thing
then we are using the right line command
basically printing out the key and the
value separated by this
space
let's save it
and run it
here you can see we are reprinting first
the key one
then the value soda
same goes for the burger fries and onion
rings
now
let's go over
our
sorted list
now for the sorted list
we also have a key and value pair
now to make it a little different
i used string here
instead of end
now
to create a sorted list we use a sorted
list
name
then
we give 2l
then we can give two
different data types for the two
different values
then we have sorter list
as list as the name
then we have new keyword
then we basically create this
then
we use add function to add the
value key and value
to this list
then we use key value pair in a for each
to print out the values
let's save it
let's close this so that we can get new
data
let's save it
and run it
and here as you can see we are printing
out american fry omega burgers french
fries lime soda onion ring in the same
order as they are added
now
let's go over a stack
now for a stack
we are using stack then we are only
giving one value since stack has only
one value one type of data in one time
so we are giving a string values to the
stack
i named this stack
just to make the pun
then we are using new keyword
and this is the basic syntax for a stack
now for stack
to enter the values in the stack we use
push command now if you remember stack
we basically push a value above another
so basically if we have given rear first
that means it will be at the bottom
because first we are entering rare then
medium layer will go up above rare then
medium will go up
a mid medium there then weldon will be
on top so when we will print this out
it will basically print
well done first then medium then medium
rare then rear last
and we are using this four inch loop to
print out this
stack
let's run it
and sure enough as you can see we are
first printing out the weldon
the medium the medium rare than rare
now
let's go
and try out cues
here qs is also using only one type of
variable so we are using string here
i have named it genqueue
then we are using new keyword
to create a new queue
and this is a complete syntax to create
a queue
here to add new data in a queue we use
nq
so we are entering mark bill xavier
michael
now
and we are also using a four-ish loop
to print out the values for this cube
let's run it
and here it is printing mark bill savior
michael just in the way it was skewed
now we have discussed all of these
generic lists
so now let's get back to our slides

next let's discuss a non-generic
collections
non-generic collections are specialized
data storage and retrieval classes that
handle stacks queues list and hash
tables
the system.collections space contains
the non-generated collection classes
non-generic collection classes store
elements and object areas internally
allowing them to hold any type of data
so basically
same
collection can have different type of
databases now there are various types of
non-generated collection such as
arraylist
hash table
then we have sorted list
then stack
then finally we have q
now let's now go over few of these codes
to explain each of these collections
and here we have
a non-generic list
so let's go over error list first
now here
to declare an error list we use
arraylist
keyword
then we gave it the name
l
then we have
new keyword then error list
if you notice here clearly
unlike generic list
we are not giving any kind of data type
so basically allowing us to use
different types of data types
next in the next line we are declaring a
string
which tells us
like share and subscribe so you also
don't forget to like share and subscribe
to this video
next x equals to 11
this is an integer type of variable
then we have a datetime variable
d
which basically is telling us to parse
in a datetime format this 3 december
1998.
then we are using add command to add
all three of these
in this error list
then we are using four each to print out
the serial list
now let's run it
now here as you can see it has printed
out this string like share and subscribe
then it has printed out this integer
type
then for the date time
since we asked us to pass this in the
date time format so it gave us 0 3 it
replaced the december by 12
and then given us the year 1990
after that it is also giving given us
the time
it has given us a default time of 12 a.m
since we didn't provide any date any
time from our site
now
let's check out hash tables
now in hash table
we use hash table command
then we give it a name
then
we are having the new keyword to
finally create a complete hashtable this
is the basic syntax to create a hash
table
now we are using add command to add
these values and hash table has two
pairs
a key
and a value
just like dictionary
now i use the same
data set for the dictionary which i use
for the hash table to make a comparison
then
we have for each dictionary entry to
basically print out these h key and h
value
let's run it
let's close it first for that clarity
now let's run it
here
as if you look closely it is printing
out four onion rings first then three
fries then two burgers then one soda and
why is that because in hash table
basically insert
the data
on one above the other just like a stack
now that's the bigger difference between
a dictionary and a hash table
now
let's go over a sorted list
now in a sorted list
we are using sorted list command
now if you are noticing something very
simple
we are not giving them any kind of
idea on what could be our
keys and what could be our values data
types of these so basically we can have
different types of data types here as
well
now i'm using the same data set
which i used here
in generic sorted list
to make a simple comparison
if you look closely we are saying so
that you can understand here in general
we were using
these data types
to create a sorter list
whereas
in non-generic we are not giving any
data types but we are using the same
data
now let's try and print this we are also
using dictionary entry to get access
each of these values if you had noticed
in sorted list we used key value pair
but in non-generic we are using a
dictionary entry
let's run it
and it has printed american burger
french fries and soda onion ring
then next in our list is stack
here we are also using stack but we are
not giving any kind of idea on what kind
of
values it will be
to make the pun i again use stack
then give out the values as rare medium
rare medium and well done
now let's try and print it
here as you can see it is printing out
well done medium medium rare because
it's a stack so it will always have the
last value added as its first
now let's discuss cues
and here cues
we are using q keyword to define a queue
then a name then a new keyword
and this is a complete syntax for a
queue in a non-generic collection here
we are using enqueue to print out to add
the data in the queue
then we are using
object
to
get the values from this queue
now let's run it
and here as you can see we are printing
mark bill savior and michael
now this is all for these quotes let's
get back to our slides and finish up
this session
finally let's conclude this session with
some pointers on collections
first in most circumstances it is
preferable to utilize generic
collections
since they operate quicker than
non-generic collections and help reduce
exemptions by displaying a compile-time
error
then a non-generated collection type are
found in system dot collection string
source while generic type collections
are found in the
system.collections.generate namespace
next c sharp
also has
several specialized collections that are
teamed to deal with a specific sort of
data type which may be found in the
system.collection.specialized
namespace at large the collection class
support a null as a valid reference type
value and enables redundant
element
like some duplicate elements
and this was all for today's session
