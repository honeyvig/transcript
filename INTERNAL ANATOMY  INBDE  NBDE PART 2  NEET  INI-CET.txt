yeah happiness
back here uh with the next topic that is
uh the internal anatomy and the
considerations okay
so it's one of the important topic and
of course i can
tell you this is one of the memory based
topic in entire
subject of endodontics in a few cases
you may miss the logics but it is
mandatory that you have to learn because
they are going to give questions on this
particular
area so let's start the topic so first
of all like
uh like how can i compare like
something like uh you are if you are
adapted to
a particular room for example you have
your study room
and you're very adapted to your room
because you are staying in the same room
for years
so what happens is on one day there is
no power
okay but you can enter the room because
you are well aware of the room because
you know which
object or which article or which book is
there at which place and you can
easily close your eyes and you can
easily pick the book
because you have command on the anatomy
of the room
so endodontic anatomy is something like
that
if you don't know you cannot enter
because it's something like a blind game
until you have
an endodontic microscope or until you
have a dental operating microscope if
you have a dental operating microscope
dental operating microscope is going to
improve the visualization means it's
going to provide you the magnification
and it's going to provide you the
illumination it's going to provide the
light
for the dark room whereas regular most
of the operated systems like
we go for blindfold we don't know what
is there but we just dig
and we just find something so it's
something like that a successful
root canal treatment requires a strong
command knowledge
on the anatomy of the teeth as well as
the anatomy of the root canals
and their modifications
so there are few things which i'm going
to discuss basically i'll be focusing
more on your questions rather than the
concepts
so because i'll try to cover the areas
where most of your questions will come
from
so as already discussed okay so when you
want to visualize something like when
you want to visualize the
the tentinal maps which are on the floor
of the pulp
or if you want to visualize the
fractures or crack tooth syndrome
i told you to use a dye that is
preferably you can use
this methyl methyl blue or you can use
two percentages of iodine okay followed
by you're going to
visualize under dental operating
microscope or under magnification either
by using loops so that you can visualize
this dental map clearly
and just to make a note of this
particular test which is very very
important they're going to ask the
questions that is called a stamp face
bubble test so regularly what is the
mechanism of sodium hypochlorite of
course we learn it in
irrigation solutions the mechanism of
sodium hypochlorite is to identify
the vital structure is identify the
organic structure
and dissolve it so while dissolving
these organic structures for the
leftover vital structure means the vital
structure in the root canal is going to
be the
vital wall we can see this vital pulp so
whenever it identifies
the vital valve it is going to dissolve
so when dissolving it's going to release
bubbles that bubble test is called as
samford's bubble test the material used
is sodium hypochloride
and it's going to identify the mist
canals where the vital pulp is there
the next one of course radiographs
reminds the primary and the most
important method of identifying the root
canal morphology
but is it one radiograph no it is a
radiograph of
multiple directions so there is one
question that is given in
one of the recent session like what is
waltran's radiographic method so walters
radiographic method is something very
specific to end up
okay so you take two radiographs with a
difference in
horizontal angulation of 10 to 15
degrees
so you maintain the same vertical
angulation
but you you will have a different
horizontal angulation
so the change in the horizontal
angulation is what is the change
the change is 10 to 15 degrees so when
you change this horizontal angulation by
10 to 15 degrees you can see the
overlapped things
for example in one situation there may
be two canals
which are present on the uh the digital
root of the
mandibular molar may overlap but once
you change the angulation
they can be seen as two that is the main
use of this
wall trans radiographic method so make a
note always try to take more than
two or two radiographs more than two or
two radiographs are mandatory and
different horizontal
angulations maintaining the same
vertical angulation same vertical
and different horizontal very important
the next comes of course uh the latest
trend of cbct has
lots of importance in dentistry and of
course i like most of you are preparing
for dds and
according to my references and according
to my
like feedbacks from my seniors and most
of us
in usa it is mandatory to take a
radiograph
before you start any root canal
treatment and they charge
a decent amount for cbcd also but
i feel like in india it's very rare to
see
a cbct before you start an adult
treatment in the clinical scenario very
very rare
in the clinical practice like in the
colleges for the academic use of course
i have seen i have taken cbct's
but uh so that's what the trend is like
in usa so it's mandatory that you have
to learn so much related to cbcp
so cbct is something like it's going to
give you three dimensional view it's
going to give the anatomy at different
levels
anatomy everywhere so it is the best
modality
it's a non-invasive best modality by
which you can
i mean like uh know the anatomy without
damaging the tooth structure
right so you can see this is a case
where you hack you can see
more canals regular anatomy as everyone
can do but a
tricky or complicated anatomy you you
must need aids like cbcd you just need
it's like dental operating microscopes
to see that with the naked eye
because it's all like blind game until
now everything is blind again so
you need something to visualize it so
the best method is going to be the cpcd
and of course i already was stressing
you from day one that is dental
operating microscope maybe not
a few dental colleges i mean like dental
schools and dental
universities which may ask you to do
your bench test under magnification
either by using the loops or either by
using the
gentle operating microscope like before
you go and attend this bench test make
sure you just
aware of this okay so because most of
you
were not well aware of dental operating
microscope so you need to work
or loops we regularly don't use it okay
so i want you guys to
make a note of this okay in future it is
required to know
what is happening around this so i just
want to talk about few
important aspects here and there
which were given in examinations or
which are which were the questions
uh in your examination so first i am
going to talk about the maxillary
central
regularly your maxillary central incisor
is going to have one root and one
canalic and you can see the lateral
canals in
60 percentage of cases and your
maxillary central
is most often
i mean if you see the canal it is most
often triangular in shape
very rarely you can see oval so it's
better to better to go for
a triangle as a as a very very decent
and a good option
the next comes is the maxillary lateral
so maxillary lateral you will have
curvatures curvatures are most common
in maxillary lateral incisor okay
regularly you see
one root and one canal and the shape if
you come to the shape it is
oval in shape you will have curved roots
make a note you'll have curved roots and
make a note we have already discussed
these two points that is
your palatal gingival group is most
common at this area and your palatal
abscesses your palatal abscess are also
most common in the maxillary lateral the
next comes is the maxillary canal
maxillary cannon is also
one root and one canal mostly and it is
the
longest okay your maxillary canine and
mandibular cannon
are the longest tooth in the
in the oral cavities okay and
if you see the cross section the cross
section is
all and make a note your maxillary
canine
uh is having a
digital inclination okay so all your
maxillary
maxillary lateral maxillary central
maxillary canine
all these are having a bit
distill inclination okay
so that's an important thing that you
have to make a note so i'll slide away
jump to the mandibles okay so coming to
the
mandibular centrals and laterals mostly
it is
central and laterals are
centrals and laterals are they contains
one root
but chances of two canals are common
right
chances of two canals are very common
like in 20 to 40 percentage of cases
you'll have two canals in the maxillary
centrals maxillary central and lateral
incisor and
the cross section you see is long wall
the cross section you see is long oval
in this case and coming to the
mandibular canine so the few
important things that you have to make a
note about mandibler cannon one route
okay one route you'll have one route and
the crown was labial inclined you'll
have a labial inclination of the crown
so whenever you have a labially inclined
crown make sure you
you you try to
you try to do the axis opening by giving
by by giving the proper direction if not
you're going to cause
the perforation right so it is very very
important you just make and what about
this
labial uh i mean labially inclined
okay and the next important aspect is
coming to the cross section you see it
is large vowel
okay so these are the important things
that you have to make a note
and of course these c-shaped canals are
not much familiar in the case of
americans
so they may not ask you questions but
these are most commonly seen in the case
of uh
asian asian people okay they may ask
this question uh
uh in the in the in the bench test okay
so
she shaped canals are most commonly seen
in which are the teeth the c-shaped
canals are most
commonly seen in the case of mandibler
second molar mandela second molar you
can see these three shaped canals most
commonly
and these are common in the case of
asians
okay i hope you have done these
important points
and coming to this normal uh tooth
structure it's divided into kernel
root and radicular radicular portion
and each component is going to have
enamel dentin pulp cementum and pdl
which we are going to discuss in detail
in dental uh not
so the pulp is classified into coronal
pulp and the radicular pulp and the
coronal pulp
of course this is a question again for
you guys coronal pulp has how many
surfaces coronal
pulp has six surfaces what are the six
surfaces that is occlusal mesial digital
buccal lingual and floor make a note of
this
next jumping to the pulp horns and of
course i hope you know the meaning of
pulp horns which
which are going into the cusps and the
lobes
and the application-based question is
why permanent crowns are contra
indicated in any individuals because
pulp horns are highly placed when you're
giving crown cutting there are high
chances that the pulp horns can be
exposed right
the next course is the radicular pulp
radical pulp is the pulp that extending
from the cervical region of the crown
towards the
epics so this is called as this part is
called as
the radicular pulp so the radicular pulp
at the end is going to communicate with
the
very epical connective tissue through a
foramen called as
the apical foramen
the next comes you need to make a note
of this landmarks that is
i mean the most important uh essential
landmark
to identify the pulp chamber is cemento
enamel junction so make a note cemento
enamel junction is an important landmark
for
location for
location of pulp chamber and orifices
whereas cemento dentinal junction is an
important landmark where your
root canal
preparation should end
okay so if you see this dental structure
teeth okay so this is your cemento
enamel junction
whereas
whereas this is your cement or dentinal
junction
so your root canal preparation is going
to start at cement enamel junction
and at cement or dentinal junction so
this is
the end where you are going to find the
working length
so your working length your
biomechanical preparation your
observation everything should end at
cement or dentinal junction they should
start at cement enamel junction
right so location of pulp chamber cement
enamel junction
and end of your preparation everything
cement antenna junction
so these are the few uh i mean last that
you have to make a note
laughs centricity means your your
floor of pulp chamber is always located
in the center of the teeth
at the level of cement and ammo junction
law of concentricity says that the walls
of the pulp chamber
are always concentric
to the external surface okay same as
external surface at the level of cement
and i will junction
law of ch is of course this is a
constant and important landmark which
helps in the position of the
pulp chamber
okay the next goes is basing upon the
relationship of the pulp chamber
and the clinical crown
the pulp horns i mean the pulp chamber
has some
symmetry class the symmetric law is
symmetric lava
the lava one says that except there is
exception
except for maxillary molars the orifices
of the canals are equidistant means they
are
if you draw like this they are
equidistant
in in a particular direction that is the
mesodigital direction
la 2 says that except for the maxillary
molars
the orifice of the canal slice a line
perpendicular
to the line drawn from okay this is a
line okay
if you draw a perpendicular line they
they lie in the same area
so if you draw a perpendicular line okay
ah across the center of the pulp chamber
so this is lava
and this is la two of symmetry law of
color change has already discussing
about the dentinal map so the dark color
where you can see something like a map
this is called as dentinal map
so the color of the pulp chamber is
always darker
so the dentinal map is always darker
than the walls
the walls will be bright in color
whereas your tentacle map will be dark
in color
so law of orifice location one the
orifice location
one last says that most of your canals
are located at the junction of the wall
and the floor
so this is the floor and this is the
wall so at the junction of both
so at the junction of wall and floor you
can see your
orifices location 2 says that
it is located at the angles angles in
the floor involved previously i told it
it can be located in the junction
junction is this
angle is this so if it is not located in
the junction it will be located in the
angle
next rfs location 3 says that okay
previously the first one is junction the
second one is
the angle and the third one says that it
is
located at the terminals of the root
developmental fusion lines okay so root
developmental fissure lines are nothing
but the same area
okay developmental fission lines is a
place where you can see the
orifices is the law of orifice location
three says that
so we need to make a note about the
canal configurations according to the
beans
there are four types of canals first one
is one one means it starts as a one
and ends as a one second one is
two one okay it starts as two separate
canals and ends at one so it is called
as two one
the third one is two two start set two
one two and set two one two the third
one
fourth one is start set one and then set
two so it is
one one two one 2 2
1 2 that is type 1
type 2 type 3
and type 4 so there is slight
modification of veins and it is done by
vertices
in vertices you will have eight types
okay that is
type one that is one one
type two that is two one type three
one two one means it starts as one
splits into two and ends at one
type four which is two two starts at
one two and set one two you have this is
two two
the next comes is type five okay type
five is
starts at 1 and ends at 2 type
6 it is starts at 2 combine to 1
and end set 2 type 7 is 1 2 1 2
starts at 1 splits into 2
again one and split into two type eight
is
three three you have one two three you
have one two three
i hope it's very very clear they're
going to ask this configuration
questions were being asked so please do
make a note of this next comes are the
accessory canals
so accessory canals are an extra canals
right it's it's an extra canals you can
see all these my nude extra channels
so these are the minute canals uh that
are extended
horizontally or vertically laterally
from the sorry from the
from the pulp and peridone okay so these
are
either horizontal vertical lateral and
make a note that 98 percent is of
ethical ramifications 93 percentage of
lateral ramifications are present in
apical one-third so this is an ethical
one-third area
where you see lots of ramifications
that's apical is 98 and lateral is 97
so that is a reason why whenever
whenever your root canal system fails we
generally go for
a back section so apex sector is done by
like how many uh how many millimeters it
is done by so it is done by three
millimeters why
because all these epical and lateral
ramifications are present in the three
millimeters so remove them
because these ramifications are the
primary reason for
the endodontic failure so remove them
accessory canals your lateral canals
all these ramifications are the causes
for the failure of endodontic treatment
so remove them
so okay if you want to remove where you
have to remove so
this apical three millimeters is going
to contain them so remove it
right so basically how this apical uh
accessory channels are formed accelerate
channels are formed by the entrapment of
the periodontal ligament vessels
in this root shield helium during the
calcification
because of which you can see this
accessory channels and detection of
accessory channels how can you detect an
accessory canal
so when you're going through the
periodontal ligament
uh during your radiographic observation
if you if you see a periodontal ligament
observe the thickness of the periodontal
ligament of the periodontal ligament
space
suddenly you can see a bubble or
suddenly you can see some deviation
on the lateral wall of the
root okay because if you see
this is your periodontal ligament so
suddenly if you see some morphological
change in the periodontal ligament
for example this is your root and you
see your periodontal ligament like this
suddenly you can see some extra thing
then you can predict okay there is some
chances of occurrence of some
axiory or lateral canals all that
particular area
uh significance is uh they play a very
vital role uh
in in the exchange of the irritants or
irritants or the bacterial components
okay because they are going to be the
culprits for the endodontic failure and
pulp may
be in this area may be inflamed or
necrotic
okay so you need to take certain
precautions to remove this
and to make this area very clean okay
because it's very difficult to access
with a normal uh conventional endodontic
therapy so you need to go for advanced
endodontic therapies where you need to
plan and remove these accessory canals
so the next course is the fercation
canal canal which is seen in the
furcation area is called as fercation
canals
okay so these are most commonly seen in
the case of multiple rooted teeth
where you'll have bifurcations
trifurcation at that particular area you
can see this forcation canals
isthmus okay i hope you have learned
this definition is a
two canals okay when they're connected
by something
which is not visible so is defined as a
you can see you can see the diagram as a
ribbon shaped
inter canal communication or a
transverse anastomosis or a corridor
between two root canals where you can
contain dental pulp and pulp related
tissues
so that is called as isthmus and you
have to take utmost care to
dissolve or remove the pulpal tissue or
the irritants that are present in this
isthmus area also it's very difficult to
do this but
by using the advanced irrigation
solutions or irrigation
protocols and the devices you can you
can remove the isomers
also so we learn about few abnormalities
okay this is an abnormality which is
seen in the asian population
but it is very familiar so they can ask
you okay shovel-shaped
incisors are seen in the case of
anterior teeth okay and the next comes
is
of course we have discussed this in the
class that is this palette of
gingerbread surgery i have discussed
with you
so this is a lateral incisor which is
having this palette of gingival growth
which is leading to endoperial lesion
so how you have a treat you have to open
the flap
and you have to seal everything over
this particular area
with gic followed by because you have a
heavy bone loss here
so it is mandatory that you have to keep
a graft bone graft over this particular
area and you have to
seal it so uh the i mean suturing is
done
so this is a three months follow-up and
this is a six months follow-up you can
see uh reduction the radiolucency okay
so here
compared to here you can reduction the
radiolucency and decreasing in the
uh probing depth okay so
let's let's learn a few important aspect
your maxillary and mandibular
molars are very very important because i
can see many equations on this
particular area
so we'll be discussing the mandibular
molars in detail so coming to the
mandibular molar that is the first
mandibular molar
you can see the outline the outline is
uh
trapezoidal and outline important point
and if you see the canals uh on the
mesial side
you have two canals uh digital side in
the most of the situation you have one
canal
so these two canals are the mesolingual
and mesobuckle once one is
going to the lingual side one is going
to the buccal side and
the distal canal is regularly oval in
shape
and you have one digital canal which is
largest in most of the cases
okay uh and if it is the largest one and
if it is one it is regularly present in
the center
but if you suspect a canal which is
present in
either buccal or lingual direction
not in the central then you can assume
that there are two channels
okay for example if you find it on the
buccal side that still cannot
then you have to you have to negotiate
and try to find on the
lingual side also then if you have two
canals
on the digital side that is that can be
seen in 28 percentage of cases
these two canals are nothing but
distur-lingual and dystrophical so if it
is three canals
that is mesolingual mesobuccal and
distal if it is four canals
that is mesolingual mesobuccal disto
lingual
and disturbance right so
this is an important thing that you have
to make out and make a note uh
your your axis axis opening should be
always on the mesial side okay two
thirds of your axis opening
should be on the mesial side because
your pulp chamber the two thirds of the
pulp chamber
of this teeth will be on the mesial side
so your axis opening should
begin on the mesial side okay so that is
very very
important that you have to make a note
and the teeth which most frequently
uh go for endodontic treatment mostly
endodontic treatment is
your maxillary molars so your mandibular
molars when compared with the maxillary
molars
okay so morally we do endodontic
treatment on the mandibular molecules
because mandibular molars are more prone
for dental caries
because in most of the situations
smaller leading to pulpal infection is
because of dental care so dental caries
is more in the maxillary
sorry it's more in the mandibular first
molars okay it's more in the mandibular
molar so root canal treatments are more
in mandibular molars when compared with
the maxillary
molars and make a note care should be
taken because maxillary man this
mandibular molars are more prone for
lingual perforation
so you do more lingual perforations
in uh this mandibler molars so
you have to take utmost care to avoid
that
okay so that is an important thing that
you have to make you know so this is the
difference between the maxillary and the
mandibular okay
so you can see this is a maxillary molar
regularly you will see this is a palatal
sorry i mean regular this is a maxillary
first molar
so this is a palatal one parallel one is
the biggest one
and the next one is you'll have
you'll have miso buckle and you'll have
disturbance right so this miso buckle is
one is
mb1 and one is mb2 so mesobuckles
sometimes it will be one and most of the
cases it it will be splitted into two
that is
mesobuccal and one and miso buckle two
then this two buckle and this is a
parallel
and coming to the mandibular as already
discussed regularly you will have
your mesobuckle okay your mesolingual
disturbance and distilling one regularly
you may have this configuration
two sometimes the two three canals may
be splitted into four
your maxillary molar will have this
combination three
if it is four it will be splitted into
two that is mb1
and md2 i hope uh
you're clear about this so when i'm
talking about this
i'm already done with the max the max
first
the mandibular first smaller i'll be
talking about the
maxillary first molar because most of
your questions will move around
the maxillary and mandibular molars okay
so the first important thing is
the triangular outline
the outline of the chamber is triangular
outline and
and if you see this what we have
discussed the triangular outline is
this is one
right this is one right and
this is one right this is mb this is
disturbance and this is parallel
so this this gives a triangular shape
right this triangular shape
so in this triangular shape the apex is
formed
by the effects is formed by the
palatal okay the apex is formed by the
palatal root
whereas your base is formed by the these
two okay your base is formed by these
two
and whenever you have the suspection of
the fourth canal the fourth canal will
be
lingual to that of the mesobucca so
your mb2 will be
lingual to mb1
okay lingual to the mb1
okay the next important thing is uh
most common cause for the failure okay
teeth with maximum failure rate
is the maxillary first molar because you
most of us with the naked eye it's very
difficult to
identify this ambit so that is a reason
why
so the most complicated root canal
anatomy or the most complex root canal
anatomy is seen in the case of
maxillary first molar and you can see
90 percentage of cases of maxillary
first molar will have this mb2
followed by your accessory canals
and more than 58 to 60 percentage of
cases you can see mb2
so mb2 is seen in more than half of the
cases
okay and make a note your palatal
canal is the largest canal
and it is the widest canal
it is the good tempered kernel very well
good tapered canal you can see a
maxillary first molar
so apart from this when when you want to
place post
post there is something called as post
and core which we'll be discussing
further
so when you want to place this post okay
for a particular teeth
pose should always be placed in the
largest canal so
for a maxillary first molar
the post should be placed in the
palatal for mandibular first
molar the pose should be placed in the
digital okay so these are the important
things that you have to make here
when i'm talking about the maxillary
first molar
the next comes is i just want to give a
brief idea about
this maxillary first premolar few
questions on maxillary
a few questions on your maxillary first
premolar so
coming to the maxillary first premolar
regularly your maxillary first premolar
will have two canals
so your maxillary first premolar will
have
maxillary first premolar
will have two canals in most of the
cases it will be
two canals right so and like in around
like 70 percentage of cases it will be
two canals in around like 30 percentage
of cases
it will be uh one canal
okay one channel okay so so this is a
this is a this is
i mean like this is two two that is
two two means two uh two configuration
two roots and two canals in the case of
seventy percentage of cases
and one root in case of thirty
percentage of cases
this is this is regularly and out of
these two canals if you see the two
canals one is buckle
and second one is palatal the parallel
canal is the
largest and the wider one okay the
parallel canal is the
largest and the middle one and make a
note maxillary first premolar
there is one problem on the mesial side
that is you can see this mesial
concavity
which we learn in dental anatomy so this
mesial concavity is the most common site
of perforation
so you have to be at most care when you
are treating the maxillary
first molar endodontically because there
are high chances that you may perforate
at this area
so when you come to the cervical level
of this maxillary first premolar
uh the cervical level where you can
where you can see
an electrical shape
electrical shape and few people they
call it as
a figure of eight
they call it as figure of it but make a
note the opening the opening axis
opening of this
maxillary first premolar is the oval
shift
the next goes is the mandib the next
course is the maxillary second premolar
so we are done with the first until now
so we will be focusing on
the second removal so maxillary second
premolar uh
is almost like the same it has 75
percentage of
single root and around like 20 25
percent is of
two roots very rarely you can see the
other
modifications in this but make a note
the difference between the
max first and mandible first is mandible
second mandibular second premolar is
mandibular second premolar has
high incidence of axillary canals
accessory canals around 60 percentage of
cases you can see these
accessory cameras and making it all the
maxillary teeth are
are in very close approximation to that
of the maxillary sinus
sinusitis so you have to take utmost
care regarding the maxillary sinusitis
okay when you're treating this uh
maxillary tree that is the maxillary
first second premolars
maxillary first and second
molars okay so this is all about uh
your maxillary second premolar
the next comes that we need to make a
note about the mandibler premolars
so the most commonly asked question
about mandibular premolars
if you if you consider these two i'm not
good at diagrams
if you consider these two as a
mandibular premolars
so make a note there is some landmark
that is present between the two
premolars
that landmark is called as a mental
foramen
so you have to use slob rule to rule out
so whenever you are planning an
endodontic treatment in relation to
these teeth
and sometimes what happen like if you if
you do slop from this side
what happens is the same the same iop i
can look like this
look like this so this is an overlapping
this is actually not a periapical lesion
this is in a mental format sometimes it
can be periapical lesion also
so what you have to do is like you have
to apply the slob rule so that
by changing the angulation the mental
foramen changes the mental foramen
changes
if it is moving away then it is mental
foramen if it is
like in the similar way something like
this after changing the angulation if it
is something like this
so then you can consider it's a
periapical lesion so it is very
important consideration you can apply
your wall trans technique over here
or you can apply your slop technique
over here to identify whether it is a
mental foramen
or whether it periapical lesion and
second most important thing as you have
a bundle of nerves which are going in
between these teeth
okay regularly your periapical
endodontic surgeries so
something like we have an endodontic
surgery topic also these surgeries are
contraindicated in this particular area
because you have a vital structure
that is a mental foramen containing the
mental nerves is there so
the endodontic surgeries are
contraindicated
in this particular case
and uh the next important thing that you
have to make a note
is uh your mandible or first and second
premolars
so the difference between the first and
second premolars
uh when coming to the anatomies the
first premolar will contain
two canals two canals which may end with
two orifices or which may end with one
orifice okay
so uh this is around like 27 percentage
of cases
and the second one is mostly it will be
one and one
that is one channel and one one foramen
and it will be around like 80 to 85
percentage of cases so that is the law
basic difference that you have to make
you know when you're talking about the
first and the
second premolars
okay so i think this is more than
sufficient
so last but not the least is
you can see this typical morphologies
which are nowadays the most commonly
asked question that is one is
intermolaris and second one is
paramolaris
so what is intermolaris intermolaris is
an additional
distrolingual root okay both are seen in
the mandibular molars
okay so if it is an additional disto
lingual root
then it is called as entomolaris if it
is
an additional root dystrophical root
then it is called as
para molaris okay so make a note ento is
disto lingual root and para is
dystopical right
so please do make a note of these two
differences because again these two are
commonly asked questions if you see the
recent sessions of your uh
in video as well as nbd part two there
were lots of questions moving around
this in many many
official groups
okay done for now signing off dr
srikanth from team
imbd conquer let's enjoy this learning
phase which not only gives you
uh the tagline of pass in the
examination but
gives you lots of knowledge and interest
towards dentistry or a particular field
in dentistry
