data structure but before we begin let

the latest technological advancements

now without any further delay let's get
started with the agenda for today's
discussion
we will start this discussion by
understanding the real life example of
greedy algorithm
following which we will deal with the
introduction to greedy algorithm
advancing ahead we will understand
example of the greedy algorithm once we
are done with that we will look into the
demerits of using greedy algorithms
and finally we will cover the
applications of greedy algorithm to
understand how we utilize it in our
daily lives
now let's get started with our first
topic
here we will look into the real life
example of greedy algorithm in order to
understand it better this is alex he's
quite wealthy and intelligent as he
works for one of the most reputed it
firms
and this is alex's best friend rachel
rachel is in dire need of 85 right now
however she needs money in such a
quantity that the number of coins is
kept to a minimum so rachel shared this
issue with alex and asked him for help
now alex is thinking about rachel's
issue which he can easily fix because he
has a limitless supply of fifty dollars
twenty dollars ten dollars and five
dollar coins stashed in various bags
although this being said alex needed to
think about the constraint rachel told
him about he needed to give her money
such that the number of coins utilized
must be minimal to do so alex began
making a list of the various coin
combinations in which he could present
money to rachel however after a while he
became confused due to the vast number
of conceivable combinations
so he decided to use his programming
ability to solve real life problems
alex developed a program that will
provide him with the optimal number of
coins that he can present to rachel this
generated program was iterating through
the different possibilities to choose
the best solution
at each iteration the program added the
coin of the largest value that was not
taking aleks past the amount to be paid
which is 85 dollars in this case
for 85 dollars the largest denomination
id can start giving is 50
now id is still short of 35 to reach the
amount so that the next largest coin
program can take in as twenty dollars
but since the program still requires
fifteen dollars to meet the threshold
the next highest denomination it can
accept is ten dollars followed by five
dollars
the best part about this program was
that it allowed alex to present 85
dollars in just four coins which is
fairly incredible
the vital thing to note here is that
after each loop the program makes a
greedy choice providing the coin with
the highest potential value what i mean
here by greedy is that locally optimal
choice is picked at every step to reach
the global optimum solution now moving
ahead we will formulate the idea of
greedy algorithms
basically a greedy algorithm is based on
a problem-solving method that involves
making locally optimal decisions at each
stage in the hopes of achieving a global
optimum
that means at each stage we choose a
locally optimal value in the hopes of
arriving at the optimum possible end
result
furthermore this algorithm is an
optimization technique that can find
either minimum optimum result or maximum
optimum result
the best part about this algorithm is
that it is simple to understand and
implement as well additionally the
runtime complexity for this algorithm is
pretty reasonable
however the fundamental disadvantage of
this strategy is that we only receive
the globally optimum value in a small
percentage of cases
having said that you must be thinking
about when to implement this algorithm
for solving particular problems as it
does not always produce globally optimum
results
well let me tell you guys that we have
two conditions to judge our problem for
implementing greedy algorithms
the first condition is the greedy choice
property this notion states that making
locally optimal judgments can lead to
the global optimum solution for a given
problem
the second condition is about optimal
substructure
the problem has an optimal substructure
only if an optimal solution to the
entire problem comprises the optimal
solutions to the subproblems
in simpler words that means the problem
can be split down into multiple
sub-problems and the solutions to these
sub-problems can collectively lead to a
solution for the entire problem if both
the above-mentioned properties are
satisfied by the problem then we can
create a greedy solution for that
particular problem
moving forward we will look into the
steps for constructing a greedy solution
finding the substructure or sub problem
that can lead us to the final answer is
the first step in building a greedy
algorithm
because in this algorithm we are just
trying to operate with local optima to
reach the global optimum solution
the second step is about determining the
type of solution the given problem can
result into that can be either the
largest sum or minimum path
the final step for creating the greedy
solution is about creating an iterative
process for traversing through local
stages and making decisions to reach a
globally optimum solution
now you might be confused about how we
can do that
well let's go through an example to
understand the approach to implement a
greedy solution
the example that we are going to deal
with is called the traveling salesman
problem in which a salesman is supposed
to reach the destination from a given
current location
the representation of cities and parts
connecting them is done using graph
structure where each node is considered
as a city and edges connecting them as
parts having edge weight as the distance
between the two cities
now in this case we are supposed to find
the minimum path between two cities so
to do that we will begin from the
current arbitrary position from this
node called as starting location there
are three possible paths but the path
towards city b has less distance hence
we will traverse this edge primarily as
it is an optimal local route
we have reached city b now and from this
node we have two possible parts out of
which one part directly leads us towards
the destination city having distance 20
but the other path leading towards the
city f has edge weight value or distance
value as 2.
hence according to the local optimal
decision we will choose the edge
connecting cities b and f for traversal
we have reached the city f now from this
node of city there is only one path
leading us to our destination
hence we will traverse it now we have
reached the destination city the path
highlighted in the green shade is the
global optimum for this tsp problem you
can verify that by calculating the edge
weights for all other possible parts
since the solution allows us to reach
the global optimum by making optimal
decisions at the local stage this
strategy to solve the problem will be
considered a greedy approach
now moving ahead we will look into the
demerits of using greedy algorithm
we have learnt that the greedy algorithm
makes decisions based on local optimum
instead of analyzing the broader picture
of the whole data hence there is a
possibility that the greedy solution
might not be the best optimal solution
for some problems
for example consider this travelling
salesman problem
in this problem the highlighted part is
a created solution to reach the
destination city from the current
location using a greedy algorithm
but if you observe this graph the
selected solution is not the global
optimal solution for this problem in
contrast it is the worst generated
solution to reach the destination
that is why the greedy algorithm is
considered to be prone to correctness
issues
even if the algorithm is correct proving
why it is correct is difficult thus it
is deemed to be trickier to solve
specific issues
now we will discuss about applications
of greedy algorithms to understand their
importance
the first application of a greedy
algorithm is its use for constructing
minimum spanning trees
the coring approaches that we use to
generate msds is based on the greedy
algorithm
both prim's algorithm and crystal's
algorithm are known as greedy algorithms
as they make decisions based on locally
optimal decisions
the next application of the greedy
algorithm is it's used to implement
huffman encoding and decoding algorithms
the huffman coding technique is a
lossless data compression method
the concept is to give variable length
codes to input characters the lengths of
which are determined by the frequency of
the related characters
the smallest code is assigned to the
most frequently occurring character
whereas the largest code is assigned to
the least frequently occurring character
this process is carried out by making
local optimum decisions
hence it is also considered to be a
greedy algorithm
the final application of the greedy
algorithm is its use for developing
solutions to well-known coding problems
those problems are the activity
selection problem job selection problem
and fractional knapsack problem
all these problems generate solutions by
making decisions at each local stage so
the solutions for these problems can be
developed quite easily using the greedy
approach
