when going through some of the popular
job boards online you would easily see
sql developer is one of the most
demanding jobs seek by companies
as we all know today companies collect
vast volumes of data and store it in
their own databases they want
professionals with a good understanding
of data who can keep it safe and secure
so first we will understand who is a sql
developer
sql developer is a person who is
accountable in creating and managing
huge data assets of a company
in other terms sql developer is a person
who can develop sql databases as well as
write and test code
let's understand this with the help of
an example
let's say we want to search a particular
product on amazon website and amazon has
stored all its data about products in a
database now we will write the product
name in the search bar and when we click
on the search button it will run a sql
query that fetches all the information
about the product and displays us on the
website so this is the basic task done
by a sql developer
now we will understand the
responsibilities of a sql developer
all databases have a structure and logic
behind how data is stored and retrieved
a sql developer designs the database
accordingly for businesses that is
called database modeling
after the database is created and
deployed it's the sql developer who is
responsible for fixing the general
issues of the database
sql developer should be well versed with
structured query language to create
optimized sql queries and refines the
existing ones to extract information
from the database
sql developers run several diagnostic
tests to keep a check on the server and
the database in order to understand how
to organize companies data sql
developers must communicate with
tactical and non-technical persons from
the business and sql developer also
gathers client requirements and
identifies the features that the
database owners want
as data is an asset to a company sql
developers backup and restore data for
the clients
they also perform tasks like data
management and data migration that is if
a company has stored all its data on a
local storage and now it want its data
to be stored in a cloud storage so the
safe transmission of the data from local
storage to cloud storage is known as
data migration and that is done by the
sql developers
after knowing the responsibilities now
should look for skill set required to be
a good sql developer
one should have a good knowledge of sql
commands functions joins and procedures
let's have a look at few commands such
as create drop alter and truncate these
commands come under data definition
language we also have insert update and
delete commands these commands come
under data manipulation language we have
grant and devop commands these commands
come under data control language we also
have commit rollback and save point
commands these come under transaction
control language these are the basic
commands a sql developer should be
familiar with
and a sql developer may have a little
command on any one programming language
you don't have to be expert in
programming all you need is how to
interface between application and your
database for example you are using mysql
and your web application is based on php
then you should know how to connect your
application to the database and how to
issue queries
how to fetch results and then how to
display it to the users
one should have a good understanding of
various database management systems such
as mysql microsoft access oracle postgre
sql dbase foxpro sqlite
ibm db2 libreoffice base mariadb and
microsoft sql server
one should know integration of databases
with data visualization software such as
power bi and tableau which helps
businesses to make better decisions and
give you an add-on as a sql developer
once you develop critical thinking and
problem solving skills to create
optimized queries

india
in the united states sql developers draw
an average salary of dollar 72
282 per annum in india the average
salary of a sql developer is rupees 4
