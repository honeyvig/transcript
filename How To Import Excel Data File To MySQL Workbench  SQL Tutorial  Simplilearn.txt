without further delay let's get started
so how to load spreadsheet data or Excel
data to SQL let's quickly get back to my
SQL workbench so here let's say you
wanted to create a table and load the
data so if the data is minimalistic
maybe the data about 10 rows or 15 rows
you can manually create a table and
insert the elements into your table
using such insert commands but this set
like mine which is in the Excel
spreadsheet and has about 10,000 rows
would you like to you know write 10,000
insert commands no right it would be
really time consuming so for situations
like this my SQL workbench has enabled
developers to load the data from
spreadsheets within a few steps but
before we get started let's check our
column headers so here you can see uh it
is not compatible with the MySQL
workbench or SQL commands right so it
has a space and it has a word row and it
is a keyword in my SQL right so we don't
want that confusion so for that reason
we will try to modify this maybe using
an underscore right similarly for the
row ID you can eliminate space and use
an underscore and when it comes to order
ID the same so just let us quickly
change all the column headers so that
they are SQL
compatible there you go so we have
replaced all the row headers with
underscores and made them SQL compatible
so let is save it and when you're saving
it just make sure that your Excel file
data is also having the uh you know SQL
compatible uh name so here we have load
CSV to my SQL so here we have the name
with space right so let's try to change
that to lowercase Excel data and there
right now it is SQL compatible Now
quickly let's go back to my SQL
workbench here we have it now you can
just create a new table just right click
here or you can also do it from here
create a new database and the new schema
will be the name of your data set so
let's type it as Excel data or just
Excel and apply now this is the schema
apply now you have uh Excel right here
just drop down on here you can see the
tables right click the tables and here
you have the option of uh import data
Vis it right just click on that now
browse your folders and have it so yeah
another notification for you guys so you
need to save your Excel spreadsheet in
the form of comma separated file right
let's quickly go back and do that open
your spreadsheet go to file save as
comma separated file save there you go
now let's get back to workbench and now
I think you will be able to find it just
open next drop table of exist make sure
you do that to be on the safest side and
check all the names here so we have a
problem with row ID but that is
something which you can fix down the
line and before you go to the next step
check all the other names as well every
other name on the column header is fine
just the first one we can just Al to the
table not a big deal and uh next it
should start
importing there you go the data file got
imported of course it took a little
while because it's 10,000 that's normal
now let's quickly go to the next step
and here you can see
9,987 records imported successfully just
click on finish and I think it should be
shortly done let's close the schema go
to the query table and yeah so you can
quickly refresh so that you will have
have the Excel data over here now let's
use the database that is
Excel on it now we are in Excel database
now the table we looking for is
Select St from the data name the data
table name is Excel data without a space
semicolon just quickly run it and I
think we should be shortly able to see
all the data sets right over here yeah
about the First Column IDE
we can simply use the alter table um
function or query to change the name
let's quickly do that with the table
name alter
table
rename okay what was this copy that copy
field name rename row ID
to so um a small syntax are there so I
think they should be sorted yeah and now
let's quickly run this and I guess it
should be done now let's quickly run the
select command again there you go so we
have the row ID order ID uh order dates
ship date shipment mode customer ID
customer name Etc and everything is as
per the
expectations and that's how you can load
Excel data to mySQL workbench and that
