hi guys good evening all today I just
want to have it you take up a few
important things that are very important
either in the need point of view or in
the names wonderful as these are the two
exams that we are having ahead right so
I just want to go in a question/answer
format rather explaining the concepts or
the things in detail it's just a recap
is just a fast revision point of view
completely don't expect me to explain
each and everything as a spoonful okay
let's start with is the first term CQ is
related to the in your tech tools which
was given by the answer is smarter okay
the next one is few scientists names
related to the gutta-percha first one
the gutta-percha was first given by and
the composition of gutta-percha was
given by Frenchman and gutta-percha
which can be used as a temporary stop
justice concert was given by him so
that's the reason why gutta-percha is
Cornishmen
hills strong okay so coming to the next
question
classification of classification of
theories basing upon the etiology of
progression of this is okay the progress
of this is this this classification was
given by Simon see these coordinates
my most efficacious next one there is
something called a line of demarcation
when you have like calcium hydroxide
okay this line of demarcation was first
given by glass
gender okay and something like drone of
violation it will be toll of coagulation
which is associated with the line of
demarcation when you apply calcium
hydroxide the thickness of this role of
violation which is very important mc2
that is zero point three to zero point
seven millimeters and this is also
called as named Sonya line of necrosis
so we are very clear so the next is the
differentiation between in Sector and
the second engine of given size next
question
animal itching patterns you know the
dynamics and a few eating patterns of
enamel these itching patterns are given
biased Silverstone MTA was first given
by a banana shaft and in dentistry
first you say sleep silent or techniques
given by Tony
so the next important thing is about the
bowler bars okay a few questions relates
to the bowler but molar bar is a regular
bar which has a long shank
so it has in a long shaft that is used
to locate the calcified scanners and the
material with which it is community
scholarship a spider's carbide the case
of needle that is used for irrigation
ranges from 25 for status and the case
that is used for aspiration biopsy
painting and the percentage of mercury
in more runs pretty capsulated amalgam
is 42 to 45 percent deaths whereas in a
normal condition it is 50 percentage
whereas in the case of a very can alloy
is 42 percent so these are the most
common and frequently asked Americans so
once you are done with this and I just
want to give a few questions related to
the decontamination or this infection of
gutta-percha that is 0.5 percentage of
annual CL first five minutes for one
percentage of and Nevo CL for one minute
so these are the disinfection of the
decontamination techniques so there is
one more thing called as the
sterilization of gutta-percha
that is use of 2.5 25.2% days of
and say whoa CL for one minute followed
by followed by placement each team three
percentage of h2 water this is the
protocol further sterilization of not
about you so followed by I won't explain
the string test this is called in the
strings out test so at least one inch at
least one inch of sealer without
breaking the cement to an inverted
spatula blade and it should stand for at
least ten to fifteen seconds
so while you are mixing the sealer while
you are operating the teeth you need to
test this that is called a string out
test there should be at least one inch
without breaking the cement for an
inverted spatula blade it should hold
for at least ten to fifteen seconds this
is quantum of string of tests you have
to do for the sealer while you are going
for the operations and the temperature
for the heat test is sixty five point
five degrees centigrade temperature of
carbon dioxide snow that is minus 78
degrees centigrade temperature of ice
that is zero degrees centigrade
temperature of in device that is minus
thirty degree centigrade temperature of
end of frost that is minus 50 degree
centigrade and the material that is used
in in the first is beautiful
okay coming to the fish rooms I hope you
know about these fish rolls easy way to
remember these fish zones is very simple
that is I see high-dose infections hi
I'm Joan of contamination see see Joan
of irritation and you know stimulation
it's it is present at the center and it
was very correct so if I give a diagram
based the infection is present at the
center and stimulation is also okay
infection starts from I - yes whereas
the healing starts from s - I hope you
are very clear with this also because
stimulation is the zone where you can
see fibroblasts which starts the healing
process I hope we are very clear up to
this so there are few more things I just
want to add right now one is about
the monoblock technique so this is you
can see many questions related to the
Morlocks snow managed in the case of
your aims so monoblock is nothing but
monoblock is a one unit in which the
core material the ceiling isn't and the
canal dentin forms a single unit means
wherever you are shredding so this is
you feel like if this is in a cross
section of an object if this is what you
see that the oxidation materials
followed by some sort of sealers and
followed by dental resin there of it so
all these combined to form a single
image that is Condor than a single unit
that is called as a mono block it looks
like a single block so there two people
who has classified this mono block into
three different types there are chai and
myself first classified the smaller
block into primary monoblocks secondary
monoblock and Terry sherry manova I'm
just going to the market each and
everything in a in it in a different
color so that you can easily understand
so primary Moro block is one so this is
dentist that is common for our Jane Jane
is present in hall so primary monoblock
is one where you can see the thing that
this is called as a lean cut a bunch of
the root canal building material so
primary monoblock is one where you have
a single interface that is between the
10t and the root cannot filling material
so they did it has only one interface
which is present between the red color
and the dent in white color so second
category is secondary monoblock will
keep in local as a sealer
so secondary monoblock is a one okay
where you will have a root canal filling
material one and you are going to have
an cement the interface in low color so
you'll have a two interfaces here one is
between the filling material and the
resin and one is between the resin and
the dentin so third category is
some additional things okay you can even
have a three intravenous money's between
that red and yellow second is between
the red and blue studies between the
blue and white so you are going to have
an interfaces between the post and the
bonding isn't the root canals material
and the morning isn't and the resin and
the cement so you are going to have a
three interfaces in the delivery mode of
loss to enter sense in the second time
on a block and one interface in the case
of net primary more of this is one of
the important concepts that you have to
make it so going in the Hat I just want
to cover few important mnemonics related
to the biochemistry as we are covering
bio right now
so first is I want to go a bit slow
special blood means technique you can
remember it is used search
next is southern blotting technique you
can remember the South Indians they like
those so it is south Rosa son plotting
technique is used for DNA so next is
Noren bottling technique
North Indian people they read strata
Sinatra's what his technique his army
I hope you are very clear I just want to
have a recap Western blotting technique
is used for protein identification
southern South Indians they like dosa so
it is 3 units North Indians they're like
roti so it is our yeah so there is one
more thing called as in a magnesium is
used as in its cofactor in which of the
following tangent to the question so the
answer is CET park ok what city park
means we'll learn ahead so C is
consulates these trans catalyst peas
peptide or phosphatase is a denial
toilet and our is ribose nucleus and CT
our case k is kind
hope you are clear with this so I just
want to make and what about you
ammonia acids let's make that things
very simple AlphaTech
side chain is presented okay it's
present in the code is an i3 g live G
and is Lucent I is isoleucine V is
valence G is glycine is element okay so
the next group and the thing that you
can remember is out of these they can
ask like water branched the first three
orange life is
clear the next they can ask question
like hydro hydroxyl group she's
presented the code for hydroxyl group is
st she's okay
he didn't remember like simple code
hydroxylamine water so water soluble
vitamin c this question dermabrasion
species reservation category so here it
is you can remember it has st okay so
this content what are this kind of bc
contains water esta condense water so
the code here is serum t is tyrosine
please Tyrone
tre o ni n hope you are very clear so BC
water soluble vitamins RBC hydroxyl
group containing harmonious it sir sta
the next question is sulfur containing
once the code for sulfur containing one
the answer is C MC I hope you know about
CMC that is cysteine methionine this
time
look at these are the one out of which
they can ask the sub question which of
this sulfur containing has tyre either
in it
okay so this can be the question the
next one is about aesthetics groups very
simple aesthetic groups
the answer is aspartic acid which has
acid in it glutamic acid which has acid
in it built our mind as first Isis okay
so these are the four ones which has
acidic in nature and out of this the
most commonly asked question is which
are the following acidic ammonia acid is
used further estimation of root is
estimation and say that's a repeat
question my answer is a static acid so
the next one is about the basic I can
ask what are the basic ones the code for
the basic ones is very simple that is
house fall is a basic thing that
everyone requires the answer is it
students marginese and life
next question is aromatic are aromatic
score for aromatic is P DP P stands for
finance elements tyrosine tryptophan so
tryptophan use house indoor ring in it
so that is the one one of the most
commonly asked question and yeah I hope
you are fine we have covered lots of
stuff related to this so there few codes
related to the essential non-essential
character genic glycogen ik
non-character genic both containing and
everything within your PB books just go
and have a look we'll cover in the next
video
ok I hope this video is informative
thank you take care
