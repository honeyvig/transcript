hey everyone welcome back to another
video by simplyner this is anubhav and
in this video we will be learning about
error handling in express js but before
we begin if you haven't subscribed to
our channel already make sure to hit
subscribe button and press the bell icon
so you will never miss any update from
simply learn so without further ado
let's begin and see what's in it for you
first
we'll see what is error handling
after that we'll see how does error
handling works in express js and then we
will be setting up error handling in
express js
so
what is error handling
array handling is a process in which
express catches and processes the error
that occurs synchronously and
asynchronously
express comes with its own default error
handlers
simply
in error handling the tasks are to
identify errors report them to the users
and then develop some recovery
strategies and implement them to handle
the errors
this whole process should not slow the
overall processing time of the program
now
how does error handling works in
express.js
expressjs comes in with a built-in error
handler this default error handling
middleware function is added at the end
of the middleware function stack
it automatically catches all errors in
router handlers and allow developers to
extend router handling functionalities
by middleware function
error handling in express is done using
middleware
this middleware is defined in the same
way as other middleware functions the
error handling functions have four
arguments error request response and
next
we have next function method
that matches us to the next middleware
handler in middleware
in error handling we have the next error
method this function skips all
middleware and matches us to the next
error handler for the router
now let's set up our error handling with
express
open your visual studio code
choose from over 300 in demand skills
and get access to 1000 plus hours of
video content for free visit scale up by
simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more
first we will create a new directory
for that
open your terminal
new terminal
let's write
make directory
now i will enter the directory name
i will write
simply learn
or i can also write
error press enter
you can see
the
link directory has been created
it's empty
let's go inside that
cd
see the error handling
now we are in the headline folder
now let's create a new project here
we'll write npm
y
so
as you can see
the json file has been created in the
error handling folder
now
we will install couple of packages here
okay
first we will install express
write npm
install
express
now we will also
install morgan
which locks the request
after that we'll also install http
errors
errors this package makes it very easy
to check the status code
and then last
we will install node dot
enb
press enter
this will take couple of seconds
now in the dependencies
you can see dot env express http errors
and morgan
now i will create a file in this error
handling folder
write
app.js
enter
now
let's install nodebond which helps us
not to reset our file again and again
for that we'll write in the npm
install
minus sign save
node mod
enter
this will also take couple of seconds
now
here you can see
the node one has been successfully
installed
now
open your package.json file
here
in packet.json file
you can see here
this line
i will rewrite this
you can also remove it let's write
script
and in this
i will write
nodemon
tab
dot js
yes
save this file by pressing ctrl s
yes
now
open the file
app.js
here
we will be importing some packages
in node.js
we use require function right
so
we'll write const
express
required
and
express
here we need express packages
now we will be needing morgan
we will write const
login
required
then
now
like this we will need http packages
const
error
create
error
require
http
errors we also need dot env packages to
import our environment variables
for that we will simply write required
required
and fake
for this command we need a env file we
will create a file
dot
emb
printer
and here we have our env file where we
can have our environment variables
first we want a port for this
application so we will write the port
code
3000
save this file
now
again go back to the app.js file
here
first we will be initializing our app
we'll write const
app
express function
now we will start the application for
this we will write
const port
to which it will be called
process
dot emb
dot
port
3000
now we will make our application listen
to port 3000 we will write
dot lesson
port number
port
it will call the port number
and
here we will call the callback function
header function
and here we will
make our log statement
for this we'll write console
dot log
back tag
server
[Music]
and
both
now let me start the application before
that we'll save this file
now to start the application we'll write
npm
start
enter
here
it is showing error let's find out
okay
here
here i have wrote script
here we need to write start
save this file
and now clear this screen
enter npm
start
so as you can see it is successfully
running in the port 3000
and with this we have read the end of
