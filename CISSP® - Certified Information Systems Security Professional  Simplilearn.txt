and then finally this course is
structured in eight different domains
not including domain zero zero and it
covers the entire spectrum of
information system security
and it covers the whole thing and it
goes about a mile deep in all of them
the cissp
is what we call the big daddy it is the
gold standard
first objective is to merge your
knowledge of cyber security and the it
network with the concepts and procedures
of isc squared's cissp program
certification process
i want to make sure that you're aware of
isc squared's ethical requirements as a
cissp or a member of isc squared
third i want to enhance your knowledge
to support the cissp exam requirement
that you're going to take
and finally i want to create a
consistent platform for the use and
sharing of cyber security and
information system security knowledge
let's talk a little bit about isc
squared
isc squared is the international
information systems security
certification consortium or isc squared
it is a non-profit organization that
specializes in training and
certifications for cyber security
professionals
it was founded in 1989 to meet the needs
for standardization and certification in
the cyber security industry

its mission is to support the isc
squared's mission

the industry by providing globally
recognized certifications like the cissp
maintain the common book of knowledge or
common body of knowledge or cbk
in the field of information system
security and as a soon to be cissp it's
going to be important for you to be
thinking about getting copies of the cbk
and every edition that comes out

now the cissp or certified information
systems security professional
is the most widely known certification
offered by isc squared
the cissp credential is an elite way to
demonstrate your knowledge advance your
career and become a member of a
community of cybersecurity leaders
the cissp exam tests the technical and
managerial competence required from an
experienced information security
professional to effectively design
engineer implement and manage an
organization's information security
program within an ever-changing security
landscape
some of the cissp features
the cissp is the gold standard as i
mentioned
it is vendor neutral
as far as its i.t security certification
its designation was accredited under the
ansi iso iec standard 17024-2013
the cissp examination is based on the
common body of knowledge or cbk hence
why i said it's important that you
understand the cbk and and get your copy
of the latest edition
the cissp domains there are eight of
them
the first one is security and risk
management
the second one is asset security
the third one is security engineering
and four we're going to talk about
communication and network security
in five we're going to talk about
identity and access management
in domain 6 we're going to talk about
security assessment and testing
domain 7 security operations and we'll
finally wrap up with domain 8 with
software development
security each one of these domains
covers an extremely important area of
cyber security as it's going to affect
your i.t network the steps to
certification first you must meet the
cissp eligibility
to qualify for this cybersecurity
certification you must have at least
five years of cumulative paid full-time
work experience in two or more of the
eight domains of the isc squared cissp
common body of knowledge that i just
went over you can satisfy one
of those five years
with a four-year college degree or an
approved credential from isc squared's
approved list
in case you don't have any experience at
all in it or information security
as is presented to you by these domains
and you passed the cissp exam to earn
an associate of isc squared designation
[Music]
all you have to do then is earn the
required work experience
within six years of the exam
notification that you have passed
to register for the examination you need
to create an account at pearson vue
you can go to http colon backslash
backslash
pearsonview.com
backslash
isc the number two
backslash
you create a user account select the
nearest pearson view testing center
and pay the examination fee
from there you schedule the examination
pass the exam so take the computerized
adaptive testing exam
you pass the exam with a scaled score of
700 points or greater approximately 70
percent
finally once you've passed the exam and
get notified you now have to be endorsed
by
somebody who is a isc squared cissp
member subscribe to the isc squared code
of ethics
have an endorsement like i said from a
endorsement form must be completed and
signed by an isc squared
certified professional
isc squared can endorse you
if you can't find anybody that is
certified
you can get endorsed within nine months
from the date of the examination so it's
not something you have to race to do
however you don't get your cissp
certification
until you get indoors and submit your
application
a percentage of the candidates who pass
the cissp examination
and submit endorsements will be randomly
subjected for audit and required to
submit additional information as
required for verification again remember
this is random so don't if you get
audited don't feel like you've been
singled out or
that something was wrong that's not
necessarily the case
the exam itself the delivery method as
we said it is a computer adaptive
testing
the question difficulty is matched to
your capability
the mark for review in other words you
cannot go back you cannot flag a
question
the question format the multiple choice
questions and advanced innovative
questions such as scenario based
drag and drop and hotspot questions will
be on the exam
there is no negative scoring so if you
miss a question it doesn't subtract from
your current positive score on your exam
the exam duration is a minimum of a
hundred questions with a maximum of a
hundred and fifty
it can take you up to three hours to
take the exam
key thing here
plan on 150 questions
plan on 180 minutes so you have a little
bit more than one minute per question
of the questions you're going to get of
the 100 150 25 questions will be for
research purposes
you need to reach a passing score of 700
out of 1 000 possible points
the results are provided immediately
upon finishing the exam so you're going
to know right there sitting in your
chair
the exam fee is 699 dollars plus all
applicable taxes
[Music]
from exam retake a candidate can take
the cissp exam a maximum of three times
in a 12-month period
you must wait 30 days to retake the exam
if you failed it the first time you must
wait an additional 90 days
if you have to take it beyond the second
attempt and then finally you have to
wait the full 180 days if you need to
take it
after the third attempt
the candidate you must still pay the
full fee for each additional exam
attempt
now how do you maintain the cissp
certification because trust me once you
got it you don't want to lose it
recertification is required every three
years
you have to pay an annual maintenance
fee of eighty five dollars and i believe
it just went up this year
you have to earn continuing professional
education or cpe credits
you need to post a minimum of 40 cpes
every year
and post a minimum of 120 cpes over a
course of three years
bottom line happy learning and i wish
you the very best luck in taking the
cissp exam and i look forward to
welcoming you as a fellow cissp thank
you
