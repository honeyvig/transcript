numpy and scipi in order to efficiently
handle and transform data in addition
you can also Master languages like R and
Scala which are more popular these days
for data Engineers moving ahead have a
in-depth knowledge on databases now as a
data engineer working with database
systems is a fundamental aspect of your
role as you play a vital role in
handling large data sets efficiently now
with the plethora of dbms options
available it's important to note that
you don't need to be expert in all of
them the choice of dbms often depends on
the space requirements and preferences
of the company you work for as well as
your own preferences and expertise now
rdbms such as Oracle Microsoft SQL
Server MySQL are widely adopted for
managing structured data they provide a
well- defined schema transactional
support and Rober squaring capabilities
no SQL databases like mongodb Cassandra
are designed to handle unstructured or
semi-structured data
they offer flexibility in data modeling
horizontal scalability and high
performance for specific use cases well
moving ahead data warehousing and ETL
pipelines now data Engineers specialize
in designing and building data
infrastructures including data pipelines
and data warehouses they're responsible
for efficiently collecting transforming
and storing data from various sources
now ETL stands for extract transform and
load and it refers to the process of
extracting data from various sources
transforming it into a consistent and
structured format now eer plays a
crucial role in data warehousing by
enabling organizations to integrate and
consolidate data from diverse sources
into a central repository well moving
ahead you need to master Big Data
tools now handling large data sets is a
common requirement for data engineers
and to accomplish this effectively you
often need to work with big data tools
now these tools complement their
knowledge of cloud computing as data
engineers frequently Implement code that
can handle and process large data sets
in a cloud environment therefore having
experience with tools such as Apache
spark which is a powerful distributed
processing framework that enables fast
and scalable data processing it provides
a unified and flexible platform for
batch processing realtime streaming
machine learning and graph
processing and Apache Hadoop which is an
open source framework for distributed
storage and processing of large data
sets across cluster of of computers it
includes the Hado distributed file
system or in short known as hdfs for
scalable storage and map reduce
programming model for distribution Pro
processing and finally Apache Kafka
which is an open source distributed
streaming platform deved by the Apache
software Foundation it is used to handle
realtime high throughput and fall tent
streaming data and finally learning
cloud computing well cloud computing has
revolutionized The Way businesses store
process and manage their data leading a
growing demand for engineers skilled in
cloud computing tools and platforms now
the three major Cloud servicing
providers which is Microsoft Azure AWS
and gcp dominate the cloud computing
market and offer a wide range of
services and solutions in addition
having a good knowledge on data
visualization tools like tblo qio
powerbi as well as machine learning
tools and algorithms can also gain you
more Advantage as a data engineer now
understanding machine learning and deep
learning algorithms aren't a must for
data engineer however as data Engineers
support the data scientist teams it will
provide to be helpful if they learn ML
and DL thoroughly now don't get confused
here with the role of a data scientist
and a data engineer while data
engineering data science and data
analysis are related fields they do have
distinct roles and responsibilities now
the role of a data engineer is to bridge
the gap between data scientist and data
analyst by providing them with the
necessary data and tools to perform
their task effectively so that was a
comprehensive Road mapap on how to
become a data engineer in 2023 in this
video on top skills for a data engineer
