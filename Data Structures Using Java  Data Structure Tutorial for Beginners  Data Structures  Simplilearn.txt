development program that fits your
experience and areas of Interest so as I
described earlier that array is
basically a container which can store
values or a sequence of values or
sequence of numbers or sequence of
characters into itself we can think of
it as a box which can store all the
values in a continuous fashion as you
can see here this is a just a pictorial
representation and this is coming from
the official Java docs and you can see
that we if we create an array of size 10
then we have these 10 blocks created
here you can see 1 to 10th so the whole
length of boxes the number of boxes here
are 10 but the way arrays are designed
is that the index index is basically
used to access the element in this
particular box the index of the box
boxes start from 0o so it goes from 0 to
9 so remember the array length is 10 it
array the array can contain 10 elements
but the index of the array starts with
zero and will always end at length minus
1 which is 10 - 1 in this case which
comes as 9 so it will always be length
minus 1 it will always the index will
always start from Zer and go till length
minus one length can be anything in this
case the length is 10 so the index ends
at 9 if the length was 20 the last index
will be 19 but in total you have these
10 memory locations we also call them as
continuous memory locations because they
are continuously placed and array
basically blocks 10 memory locations and
creates a container over it so this is
how an array basically looks like inside
the memory and uh whenever you want to
access the elements of the array you
will say array of zero or array of one
or array of two you basically need need
to specify the index to access the
element at index for example if you want
to access the element which is sitting
in this box you need to say array of
index 8 and we'll see how we can do that
but this is the basic uh understand
understanding and idea of the concept of
arrays so let's try to understand this
with the help of an example I will
switch back to Eclipse IDE and I've
created a very simple program here to
demonstrate the functionality of arrays
here so we already covered in the
previous lecture of what is package and
what is public and what is class how do
we give the class name and what is the
meaning of this particular method so I'm
not going to cover that again we'll
start directly from here so here the
first thing which I'm doing is I'm
declaring an array of integer this is a
variable name the identifier basically
it can be anything and this is the data
type it's an integer array and as we as
we covered this as well that whenever
you put square bracket in front of a
data type it becomes an array data type
so this is an integer array
representation now we just declared an
array but we still haven't allocated a
size to it so you can do that with this
particular uh syntax so you can put the
variable name of the array and say new
int and put the right size here this
size can be anything and once you do
this now array will actually allocate
those memory boxes which we covered here
the moment you do new int 10 this box
these boxes continuous boxes will be
placed in the memory and the memory is
allocated to this array we call this
memory allocation this is how you
allocate memory to the array so we
allocated memory to this array for
storing 10 integers the next thing is
now we can start storing elements in
those boxes so like I said that the
array index always starts with zero so
if you have to store the first element
you actually have to store it at index
zero location so you give the array name
you provide these square brackets and
you put the index value within the
square brackets that is how you
basically point to a particular element
inside the array so we say an array of
zero and we put the value 100 then we
initialize the second element which will
be index one then will be the third
element which will be index 2 fourth
element index 3 Fifth Element index 4
Sixth Element index 5 and so on until we
store till the last element so this is
the 10th element which is accessible as
index 9 and the value is uh 1,000
basically so from 100 to th000 we stored
10 values in this array and we stored
them by accessing the index and this is
actually the only way you can store
values in the array by pointing to the
indexes so we go from 0 to 9 and we
stored all the values zero being the
first element and array of nine being
the last and the 10th element remember
the length minus one concept okay so now
we will try to print all the elements
one by one that's pretty much what we
are doing now so as we covered in the
previous lecture that we use
system.out.println to print anything and
we understood the whole meaning of this
so I'm not going to repeat that now uh
we want to print the first element the
first element is sitting at index 0o and
we can access that element with this
syntax by providing the variable name
and the actual index value so I'm just
writing a random string here which says
elemented index0 and then I'm putting
this plus here and putting the variable
name this plus is basically used to
concatenate the output of a static
string with a random variable or
basically you can print anything uh with
using plus plus is used for
concatenation so I'm just trying to
print this whole value but here this is
a string value which is a static string
and then I have a value coming from the
array so whenever you have to print some
value from a particular data type or
variable or collection then you can use
this plus syntax to concatenate a string
static string with your actual value so
that's what I've done here by saying
plus an array Zer and similarly for
index one I'm printing the the first
index then for two three so far and so
on so forth till the index 9 so
basically I'm just printing the all the
values of the array starting from index
0 to index 99 so that's all which which
is written in this program now let's try
to run this program so I will write
click go to run as and go to Java
application and hit on this and now if I
just expand this console you can see all
the system.out.print statements have
been executed and they printed this so
this is the static string part in fact
including the colon this is the static
string part element and index zero
printing exactly as is and then
dynamically the zeroth index element of
an array is printed here similarly we
have printed the index one location
element index 2 location element index 3
location element and so on so forth till
the index 9 location element so in total
these are the 10 elements but the index
always works from 0 to length minus 1 in
this case it will be going from 0 to 9
so this is basically all which I wanted
to cover in this lecture the whole idea
was to give you more understanding of
arrays and remember this is just an
integer array you can similarly create a
character array you can also create a
string array for uh for you as well so
it it it's completely uh it's completely
uh related to the data type you're using
if you create a car array then you can
only store characters into it if you
create a string array then you can only
store strings into it and now you can
probably relate back to this particular
thing which I explained in the previous
lecture that we create this string array
for the reason that when you run this
particular program and if you want to
provide any command line values command
line arguments to the program those
arguments will automatically be stored
in this args and then you can access
this as args of Z args of 1 Etc in your
program that's the whole concept let's
get started with understanding arrays in
detail we have been talking about arrays
throughout this course of java in the
previous session as well and we have
covered some basic understanding of how
to create arrays how to declare them how
to fill values in the array and how do
we print the array with positions as
well as the array as whole but whatever
examples which we took previously were
onedimensional arrays because arrays can
have more than one Dimensions as well
you can create a one-dimensional array
you can create a two-dimensional array
you can create even a three-dimensional
array and you can go up to as many
dimensions as you can handle in your
Java program so it depends upon the kind
of complexity you want to have in your
program and the kind of values the kind
of structure you are going to store in
your arrays and based on that need you
can choose whether you want to use a 1D
array or onedimensional array or a 2d
array or a 3D array and so on in these
sessions we are going to talk about 1D
arrays 2D arrays and 3D arrays and after
that we'll leave up to you you to try
out more dimensionals if you want to we
have already covered the basic array
structures which were onedimensional
arrays so I will just give you a quick
walk through of how we actually handled
one-dimensional arrays so this is a
sample program to demonstrate
onedimensional arrays if you remember
this is how we use to create arrays we
write the data type of the array and
then we write the square boxes which
denote that this is an integer array
data type we assign a variable to this
and then we initialize the array with
the size 4 so new is the keyword which
is used to initialize anything in Java
and we are going to use this heavily
when we talk about classes and objects
and even collections literally any
object which you want to create in Java
requires a new keyword so here I'm
writing new and then int 4 which means
create an array of size 4 and then I'm
filling the value of the four positions
which I have created as part of this
array and if you remember when we create
these kind of arrays we store them in a
zero index based position the first
value gets stored at zeroth index
position and then so on so forth so it
will always start from zero and never
start from one remember that and after
that we just print all the values of
individual positions of the elements in
the array and if I just run this program
all of the elements of this particular
array should be printed one by one so if
I just show the full console of the
output we can see that element at index
0 was 10 element at index 1 was 20
element at index 2 was 30 and element at
index 3 was 40 so this was just a quick
refresher of how onedimensional arrays
can be written and whenever you declare
a very simplistic array it will
generally be a onedimensional array now
let's look at the two-dimensional arrays
and how do we write them when do we need
them for that I have created another
example which is says twood dimensional
array I just created a class and it has
a public static void main method and
I've created a twood dimensional array
this time so let's understand this two-
dimensional array in a bit detail and
when do we need that generally you would
need to use two dimensional arrays
whenever you are trying to do any Matrix
calculations if you if you understand
what do we mean by matrix it's basically
a 2X two structure which stores the
values in the form of rows and columns
so imagine a table of two rows and two
columns then it will be a 2X two Matrix
so if you want to store that particular
table in a Java program you would need
to store that as a matrix as a two-
dimensional Matrix rows being the one
dimensional and column beings the other
dimension and that's what we are doing
here and if you want to store that 2D
Matrix in a Java program the approach
and the procedure for it is pretty
similar to how you create a
one-dimensional array with slight
changes the first change is instead of a
single square bracket you're going to
write two square brackets because it is
a two-dimensional array so remember the
number of square brackets you are going
to put while initializing and declaring
the array is the number of Dimensions
which your array is going to have since
this is a two-dimensional array example
that's why you see two brackets here if
this was a three-dimensional array
example you will see three array three
square brackets here and so on so forth
so that's the first part of it second
part to understand is to how to store
the data remember I told you always
imagine the structure of rows and
columns whenever you are trying to store
a two-dimensional array in Java so what
are rows and what are values and how do
you represent them while you declare and
initialize a twood dimensional array so
you start with the curly braces as a
normal 1D array but inside the curly
braces you create nested curly braces
blocks we can see three blocks here they
start with their own curly brace and end
with their own then this curly brace
starts here and ends here and then this
curly brace starts here and ends here
idea is that you provide this outer
curly braces to define the overall
structure and then inside each of the
curly braces is going to represent a row
in your two-dimensional array so each of
these values this blocks is going to
represent a row so I can say that this
is the the first row this is the second
row and this is the third row and if I
try to visualize it in terms of columns
then this is the first row First Column
first row second column First Row Third
column similarly second row First Column
second row second column second row
third column and third row First Column
third row second column and third row
third column so individual values are
going to be represent ented as columns
and the whole curly Braes is going to be
represented as arrays that's the basic
mental idea or mental image you should
have while declaring a two dimensional
arrays remember to declare the rows
inside the nested curly braces and
whatever elements you have will
automatically be indexed as columns
another thing to remember that since
this is an array data structure
everything starts from zero and nothing
starts from one so this will be row zero
this will will be Row one and this will
be row two I'm talking about the
position we can still call it as first
row second row and third row but the
position of this particular row element
is zero the position of this particular
row element is one and this particular
row element is two similarly for column
as well this is column 0 column 1 and
column 2 similarly column 0 column 1 and
column two and so on so forth once you
understand this data structure well and
you have defined it correctly
then everything should fall in place if
you want to do a matrix addition or if
you want to do a matrix multiplication
or a DOT product all of the kind of
calculations can be performed using the
2D array concept here in this program
what I'm doing is I am printing the
values of this particular 2D array into
a matrix style and you see some strange
code here which is for ETC don't worry
about this I'm going to cover in detail
what this four me means and how do you
write this for now what we can
understand that we just want to print
this you might not need to print this in
your Java programs when you write a
production grid application but you
might want to do manipulations on these
uh arrays as metrics maybe you want to
create a transpose of a matrix or you
want to do a DOT product or addition or
subtraction or whatever be your use case
in this case just for demonstration
purpose I'm printing the values as rows
and columns nothing else so this all of
this code from line 8 to line 14 or in
fact line 133 is just showing how to
print the values you can see some
system.out and you can see some
construct here and like I said don't
worry about this I will cover this in
detail let's run this program and see if
my Java array is stored correctly and
how can I represent this so you can see
I have represented it in a style of a 2d
Matrix where this is the first row this
is the second row and this is the third
row similarly this is the First Column
containing the value 2 37 so column 0
will have value two and column 1 will
have this value three and column two
will have this value 7 for row zero let
me also do something here which can help
you understand this concept better let
me do a system.out.println and let's
print an individual value because like I
said the for Loop can be confusing here
to understand so let's say I want to
print ARR of zeroth row First Column and
see what kind of values do we get let me
comment this code comment is control
back slash and this code will be
commented and this code will not be
executed and now only line 15 will be
executed instead of the four BL so if I
run this I get the value seven so row
zero and First Column row zero First
Column is seven let's try with 1 one I
want to print the row at Z one position
remember not the first row but the one
position row which is basically
technically the second row so second row
second column and see what kind of
values value do I get in this case I get
six so second row second column
similarly if you change this value to
two then third row second column which
should point to four yes we get four
similarly you can write a value here as
zero and you can write a value here as
let's say two this will print the zeroth
row and the second column so similarly
whatever kind of value you want to write
you you want to access you can access it
in this fashion and remember the column
and row indexes will always start from
zero so this is a simple demonstration
of how you can use two dimensional
arrays and in this session we also did a
refresher of onedimensional array let's
get started with how to create and use a
three-dimensional array or how to go
about using multi-dimensional arrays in
Java so as you can see from this image
we talked about 1D array which is is
having just one axis then we talked
about 2D arrays in the last session
where we had rows and columns basically
an x-axis and a y axis and then we can
also have a 3D array which will have
three axises which will have an xaxis A
Y AIS and also a z AIS think of a simple
box which every box in this world will
always have at least three dimensions
and from from here you can go even build
more complex arrays which can have four
dimensions or five Dimensions or as many
dimensions as you want it to have and
today we are going to look at an example
of how can we build a 3D array and how
do we access those elements but this
picture is just to show you the mental
model of when you will be creating a 3D
array so for example generally an image
data is stored in in three dimensions so
you can you might want to store the
image data into a 3D array and there can
be many other use cases in the
mathematical and research computational
use cases where you might want to use a
3D array so but remember there's an X
axis there's a y axis and then there's a
third axis which is called The Zed axis
so let us look at a Java program to
understand how we can build a
three-dimensional array and for that I
have created this class which is called
multi-dimensional array it has a entry
point method which is the public static
vo main method and then I have created
an integer array and this time instead
of one or two square brackets I have
three square brackets and if you
remember I mentioned this in the
previous session as well the number of
square brackets which you're going to
put while initializing the array is the
number of dimensions of the array and
since in this particular program I'm
going to demonstrate a three-dimensional
array that's why you see three square
boxes let me just minim minimize this
yeah so we have three square boxes here
and we have created the variable name as
ARR or short form as AR then we start
with the outermost curly braces as is
then we put another curly braces which
starts from here and it ends here then
another set of curly brace which starts
from here and end here so this is the
this is the First Dimension this is the
second dimensions and these are the
third dimensions that's how you're going
to Define the different dimensions
remember this is the First Dimension
when the first curly brace starts then
you have this second dimension which
covers this hole and this hole and then
you have third dimension which are these
so that's how you're going to visualize
and and put the three dimensions in use
while declaring a three-dimensional
array and the values work in the same
fashion it's it's a zero index based
position so since we do not have an
official name for the third dimension so
I'm just going to use x axis y axis and
Z axis to refer to the three axises so
this would be X of 0 this would be y of
0 and this would be Z of 0 similarly X
of 1 y of 1 and Z of 1 and so on so
forth so now if I try to access the
value which is at zeroth X position
first y position and second Z position
what's the value do we get here let's
run this program and understand and
interpret the output okay uh so when we
ran this program we got the output as 11
so let's understand this output so when
we say the zeroth position on X the
first position on Y and the second
position on Zed so this is the zeroth
position on X and this is the first
position on Y and then this element is
012 is the second position on the Z axis
so to to describe it in a nutshell this
defines the x-axis so we have two
elements on the xaxis here this one and
this one then we have two elements on
the y- axis on each xaxis so this is one
this is two on the first x-axis and this
is one and this is two on the second y
second x-axis so 2X and 2 Y and then on
the Z axis I have three elements each so
hope this helps you understand and
visualize this so x-axis and this one is
other x-axis and then Y axis y axis and
then elements inside this are Z axis so
I'm saying zero with x-axis in this
block first on the y axis which is this
block and then second element or the Z
or second position element on this
particular a in this particular block
which is 11 and that's why we get 11 if
I print 0 let's say I I change this
particular value as one so now the
output should be coming from this side
so second X position because it's one
second y position so this will go here
and then the two position which is the
third element of the Z AIS which is 13
so let's see if we get 13 yes we get 13
here so this is just to show you how you
can interpret this particular array and
always be mindful of how you are
structuring this array if your structure
is gone wrong then your program will
become useless and it will give you a
lot of unpredictable outputs which might
not make sense and which may introduce
errors in your program so be very
careful how you define the structure of
the elements here that's the key and
after that you just need to understand
the x axis the y axis and the Zed axis
always remember all the accesses start
from zero so when I say two I'm
basically referring to the third element
and not the second element so this is
all I wanted to cover in this particular
session where we describe how we can use
a three-dimensional array and from here
you can go to any lens like I said you
can add more square brackets here and go
to four dimensional or five dimension or
six Dimension but remember the more
Dimensions you add the more complexity
of the program will be having the
program will become more and more
difficult to debug and understand so
always try to take a wise call as to how
many dimensions you want to use in your
array let's see what strings are and how
we can use strings in Java Java strings
are objects that contains groups of
characters like arrays strings are
immutable as well immutable means once
string is created they cannot be changed
or manipulated if we use a string hello
they are stored in a memory location
like this 01 2 3 4 are the addresses of
the locations where each character of
the string is stored now let's move on
to creating strings there are two
methods of creating string string
literal method and using new operator
this is the synx of string on the screen
first string type then variable name is
equal to sequence of characters in
double quotes this is called as string
lit method for new operator method we
use new operator and value of string is
given in the brackets now let's see a
simple program to understand the use of
strings with Java code let's create a
new project project file new project
next take the box next I'm going to name
it as strings and for the base package
I'm going to name it as string as well
because all the programs I'm going to do
in this package for
Strings we have our main program right
here the main class now before importing
the strings we need to import some pre
processive directives so for this for
this I'm going to import Java do
IO input output. star star means
everything inside the directive and I'm
going to import java. Lang do star this
means I can do all the operations that
is needed for Strings so there are two
ways to declare string this is the first
one string s is equal to Simply learn
now we have a string s and it contains
the value simply learn now I'm going to
print this
system.out.println Plus plus s or I'm
going to name it as string I'll print
string first is equal to and then I'm
going to print this so double codes
string is equal to and plus s so let's
run this
program and there we go we have string
is equal to Simply learn so it took the
value of s and printed that so let's see
the next type of string how we can
declare the
string Str Str is equal to new string
simply learn so this is the second
method how we can declare string or
assign the values to string so to print
it I'm going to use string 2 is equal to
and then Plus St Str so let's execute
this as
well and as you can see we have string 2
is equal to Simply learn as well so this
mean both the methods are to declare
strings or to assign values to the
strings so you can use any of them I
prefer using first so it's easy that's
why you don't need to write new and
string so let's move on to the new topic
classes and strings we all know that
strings are immutable now what if we
want to change something inside the
string then we use these methods to
manipulate strings in Java first one is
string Builder the string builder in
Java represents a mutable sequence of
characters it is an alternative to
string class as it creates a mutable
sequence quence of characters next is
string buffer string represents fixed
length immutable characters of sequences
while string buffer represents growable
and writable character sequences it will
automatically grow to make room for
additions like appending inserting and
deleting next we have string tokenizer a
string tokenizer object internally
maintains a current position within the
string to be tokenized some operations
Advance this current position past the
character's process string tokenizer
class in Java is used to break a string
into tokens a token is returned by
taking a substring of the string that
was used to create the string tokenizer
object now let's see different methods
for functions that can be done on
strings in Java we have lot of methods
or functions in strings these are few of
the methods that are used by programmers
frequently and we will be using in this
series of our Java tutorial next let's
have a look at a program where we are
going to reverse a string and compare to
string this is going to be an
interesting program and you will be able
to understand string a lot better so
let's get started so first we'll see how
to compare two strings and then we'll
see how to reverse a string so let's
create a new project file new project
let's click on next take the box next
I'm going to name it as compare and
reverse because I'm going to do both the
programs in the same program and we have
our main function here to use some
classes or to use some methods we need
to import some of the strings from java
so I'm going to import strings do
compare compare dot string
compare so let's write our code here so
I'm going to use four strings first
string S1 is equal to then I'm going to
use new string and I'm inside it I'm
going to name the string as simply
learn S capital and for the next string
string S2 is equal to new
string uh let's give it as practice for
the third string S3 new string let's
give it a study and for the four fourth
string we are going to match the third
string to show all the outputs that's
possible study now we are going to
display some output using the function
equals so what equals does is it it
compare two strings so first I'm going
to use it make it as user friendly by
writing comparing string one and then
comparing string two and then semi colon
so that everything will be separated you
can easily find out what the result will
be and then this is the main part S1 do
equals and in the bracket S2 because we
are comparing S1 1 and S2 so S1 do equal
S2 so this function automatically checks
whether S1 is equal to
S2 now same thing we are going to do
with string S3 and string S4 again this
user friendly S3 and
S4
semicolon S3 dot equals S4 we we know
that S1 is not equal to S2 but S3 is
definitely equal to S4 so let's try with
one more sentence so that we can compare
one more string so I'm going to compare
S1 and S4 so I'll copy paste it and
instead of S3 I'll write S1 and same
I'll do with S1 do equals S4 so let's
run this program oh before running we
have a error here so I'm going to delete
that import because we have not used it
so now let's run the program and yes we
have a result comparing simply learn and
practice is false that's definitely
false study and study both strings are
matching so it's true and simply learn
and study they don't match that's why
it's false so let's get started with our
second program that's reversing a string
so I'm going to delete everything from
here and I'm going to write same code
here only so first I need to assign a
variable of
string string input equals I'll name it
as simply learn and this is the main
part guys we use string Builder because
the string is immutable and as we
discussed earlier string Builder allows
us to do manipulation so I'll use one
more variable input one and new string
Builder so in input one we can do any
manipulation that we require so first
I'm going to do input one dot dot append
so that I can do operations that I want
on it either reversing or deleting or
concat so I'll take aend of input and
lastly input one is equal to input one
do reverse this function reverse the
string that is there in input
one now to print the value of the
reverse
string the reverse string is and then
input one so here's the catch guys we
have to use string Builder so that we
can do manipulations inside the string
if we don't use string builder then we
will get an error that unable to
manipulate the string or unable to
reverse the string so string Builder is
the main thing here so that we can do
all the operations that we want either
reversing or concat or deleting anything
from the string or deleting an element
or adding anything to the string so all
that happens because of string Builder
so now let's run this
program and there we go we have a result
the reverse string is the reverse of
Simply learn now let's try it with
something that is palindrome so we have
our language malum if we reverse this
we'll get malum so this is kind of
palindrome string and see the result the
reverse string is also malum so this is
how you reverse a string so this brings
us to the end of this video we learned
about strings the functions for Strings
and the methods we use in strings and
lastly we learn how to compare two
strings and how to reverse two strings
welcome to this tutorial on objects and
classes in Java this is a part of our
Java tutorial Series where we will be
covering everything you need to know to
master Java let us look at what we will
cover today first we will talk about
objects and we will Implement two
programs on intellig to learn about
objects then we will move on to classes
in Java where we will see an advanced
program to learn classes more in depth
so what are objects an object is an
instance of a class let's have a look at
an example in this example animal is a
class and dog is its object the object
dog has States and behaviors we can have
dogs with different breeds sizes and
colors these are considered as the
states of object dog on Behavior side
dog has Behavior like barking eating and
wagging tail so an object has its own
States and behaviors now let's look at
an example using Java code there are
many platforms to run Java program so
for this video I'll be using intellig so
let's create a new project let's let
name it as project one and finish there
we go we have a new project with we have
a class with Main and we have a main
function so the code that we write
should always be written in the main
function so let's create a new class to
understand how the object is used let's
name it as student we need variables so
that we can access the variables of this
class so I'm going to use student ID
with the integer type student
name and students
age there we go now we have these three
variables that we can use so let's go to
our main program and start our coding so
we have a class named student now let's
see how to create a object of a
class this is the syntax to create
object now the object here is s I
created a object s of class student now
let's assign values to the variable for
this we use the object s and use the dot
operator and we have options from which
we can choose from that we declared in
the class student so for this I'll use
ID and give a value similarly I'll give
age and give a value and finally let's
give a
name now we'll print its
value
now we are going to run this program
let's see what output we'll
get and there it is we have name that's
simply learn we have age and we have ID
now let us see an example how we can use
multiple objects for a single class so
let's get started let's create a new
project and I'm going to name it as
Vehicles because I'm going to use cars
and bikes in this program so I'm going
to use Vehicles as a combined form and
yes here we have a class Main and a
function main now I need two classes for
this program so I'm going to create two
classes first I'm going to name it as
bikes and the second class I'm going to
name it as cars so let's create
variables for these classes so in cars
first I need string name and I need the
cost of the car so cost can be integer
as well because I'm going to use dollar
sign in that so I'm going to use string
because of that so same thing I'm going
to do with
bikes now that our classes are created
let's create objects for this class so
the process is same but we are going to
use different names for the object first
the car class and I'm going to name as
car one and yes we have created the
first object Now to create the second
object similarly I'm going to create
five objects of the Class Cars and I'm
going to change the name for them so I
created five objects of the same class
so I'm going to create five objects of
the bike's class as well so bike one
will be a bit longer so I'm going to use
B1 till
B5 and I'm going to name them to from B1
to B5 so now I'm going to assign values
to the variables that I created in
classes bike and cars so first I'm going
to go with cars and let's name it as
Lamborghini similarly Car 2
Ferrari so I'm going to use names of the
cars that are very famous and costly so
that anyone over the world can
understand this so let's name car
3 I'm going to name it as
Bugatti similarly car
4 Pagani and car
five
now I'm going to give names for
bikes I hope everyone will understand
the names that I
give
B4 and B5 last one
Yamaha
now let's assign the cost for bikes and
cars as well so the procedure is same so
let's do it
130,000 same B2 so B1 goes for Harley
Davidson B2 for ducatti B3 for Suzuki B4
for Eos and B5 for Yamaha I'm going to
assign values for these values
accordingly for ducatti 232,000
for Suzuki
200,000
300,000 and the last one Yamaha
500,000 now similarly I'm going to
assign values for car 1. cost till card
5.
cost
$23,000 for
Lambo I think I can copy paste these as
well so let's copy paste it will a lot
faster and easier to
do Car 2 car three car 4 and car 5 we
don't need this uh as per car2 let's
take it as
252,000
and let's make it at 3
million
uh as for this let's keep it as 1
million 400,000 and lastly uh let's say
this 293 now that we have assigned all
the values for all this now let's print
it and get the value I'm going to create
a very simple program but a very
userfriendly program so it it's going to
be interesting for you guys so we are
going to ask the users what would they
like either bikes or cars so we need to
give them the options and Next program
will be based on the options that the
user select not the options we give as a
command so let's do
it let's give the options
one
bikes and two cars I need to take the
value that user gives for this I'm going
to write this
command
so I have not used scanner yet so let's
import
scanner and let's create a object for
scanner
and yes let's get back so the data type
of choice variable is integer that's why
I'm using next int if the data type was
string then I would have used next line
so now that we have Choice from the user
let's use this
value if the user chooses the first
value that means bikes so the next thing
we display we have models and we're
going to give five models for bikes to
the
user here I'm giving options to the
users so that they can choose easily
from number 1 to
5 now we can show these options to the
users so that they can choose from one
of these value so let's use one more if
statement so that we can find out
whether they have this value or not
before that I'm going to ask which one
would you like to
choose to enter the choice I'm going to
use one more variable let's say n so I'm
going to store
n if n is equal to equal to 1 that means
Hal devidson then I'm going to show the
cost of har
Davidson
this is the syntax to print the value
for the cost or any of the variable that
we use in
class what if the user says second or
third or fourth or fifth so for that we
are going to use else if
statements if n is two that means
ducatti so we have to show the rate of
ducatti or the cost of ducatti to the
user
now similarly I'm going to do for n is =
3 n isal 4 and N is =
5 now I'm going to do for n is equal
4 and lastly n is equal to 5 that is our
last bike
Yamaha
what if the users put a number that is
not between 1 to 5 so for that I'm going
to use l statement and put a message
that please enter the value from 1 and
five so now we have code for the bikes
and the same thing what if the user
selects that he wants to find the car so
for that we have this the choice is
equal to is equal to 1 so the same thing
we are going to do for choice is equal
to is equal to
2 and the same thing we're going to tell
to user that we have five
models the same names that I gave to
variables I'm going to give this to
here second one
Ferrari third
bukari fourth
EOS and the last one
POS now we are going to ask the users
their choice that which number do they
want to
choose now we need one more value so
that we can have it as a variable which
can store the choice of the user so for
this I'm going to use
C now if C is equal to equal to 1 that
means if the user wants to see the cost
of Lamborghini that he puts the choice
as one so we're going to display this
message the cost of
Lamborghini and we are going to use else
if Loop to enter the next values for C
from 1 to 5 if C is equal to is equal to
two that means the user wants to know
the rate of Ferrari then we are going to
show the cost of the
Ferrari same thing if the user enters
three as the choice
if user enters four as the choice then
we go for
Eos and the last one if user enters the
choice as five then we have to display
the cost of
posh
now what if the user enters none of the
values from 1 to 5 then we have to
display a message showing that please
enter the
value between 1 to 5 now remember the
first choice that we wanted from user to
enter either bikes or cars so what if
the user do not enter either one or two
so for that we need one more else
function to tell the user that either
enter one one or
two and with this we have completed our
code so now let's run this program for
this we need to go to run and then run
main there's a shortcut for it that is
shift plus F10 so let's run the program
and yes we have successfully executed
the program Let's test this program now
so enter your choice I'm going to enter
one and yeah we have five models Hal
Davidson ducatti Suzuki Pagani and
yamama
so enter your choice I'm going to enter
one and yeah we have a result the cost
of har Davidson is
$130,000 so with this we have completed
our code and please feel free to type
this code in your own computer and try
out all the permutation and combinations
that you can with this program so with
this let's move on to classes and
understand the classes and their concept
then we'll have a new program on classes
now let's see what is a Class A Class is
a blueprint from which objects are
created a class describes state or
behavior of an object in this example
dog is a class the variables in this
class are breed and color the functions
or methods of the class dog are barking
hungry and sleeping we use objects of a
class to use variables and functions of
the class with this let's understand
classes with a simple Java code let's
create a new
project next tick the box and let's name
it it as
automobiles let the base package be
student and yes we have a class main now
let's create some classes to do code
on I'll create a new Java class as
cars and then I'll create one more class
with the name
bikes and then one more class
automobiles so I'm going to connect C
and bikes with automobiles so that we
can use that program in Main and see
what can we do with the classes that we
create in automobiles I need some
variables I'll take private double and
let's say Fuel and then same thing
private double and then ear and let's
take one more private string and brand
now let's have Getters and Setters for
this so these are used to get the value
and set the value for the variables
inside the class there we go we have the
Getters and Setters for it now let's go
to class cars so public Class Cars
extends
automobiles so in it I'm going to create
one more class or a
Constructor and I'm going to print a
message say a new car has been created
car has been created now the same thing
I'm going to do with bikes let's go to
bikes and I'm going to use the same
thing extends automobiles this is
because I can inherit all the variables
from the automobile's class so I created
a Constructor and I'm going to print a
message a new bike has been
created so I have created Class Cars
bikes and Automobiles so let's go to
main program so this is where we should
write our code so I'm going to start
with the code now it's a very simple
code I'm going to first I'm going to
create the variables or the objects of
the class with
private bikes bike so one is car and one
is bike both are objects for the classes
so I'm going to use this
objects bikes bike is equal to new
bike
this is so that my object can function
really well and now I'm going to run it
it will take some time to
run and yes there we go our program has
executed and the things that I typed a
new car has been created a new bike has
been created are done now let's try
something else using the classes so I'm
going to bikes so I'm going to create a
new method or a new function public void
kick for bike so I'm going to print
message the bike has been started with
kick bike has been started with kick now
the same thing I'm going to do with car
now how does a car start with a key so
I'm going to make a function public key
and inside it I'm going to print the
same message car has been started with
key oh I should write void there to give
the return value as wide so let's print
the message car has is been started with
key rotation let's write that as well so
in the main program I'm going to use
objects to use those functions and let's
see what changes they'll do to our
program bike. KCK and car. KCK let's run
this and there we go first we used to
have this two messages but now these two
messages are also there as well because
we invoked those functions and methods
that are there in class cars and bikes
so if I write bike do key or car. kick
this won't work this is because key is
not a method of bike or kick is not a
method of car so that's why I gave
private static for the functions so if I
execute it these are the error messages
that I'll get cannot find the symbol
method kick or method key thank you for
