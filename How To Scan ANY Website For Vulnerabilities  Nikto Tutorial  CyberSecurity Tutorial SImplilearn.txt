whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back and before commencing guys just a
quick info for you if you are an
aspiring cyber security professional
looking for online training and
certification from prestigious
universities and in collaboration with
leading experts to enhance your
credibility then search no more simply
learns postgraduate program in cyber
security from Mi University in
collaboration with EC Council should be
your right choice for more details you
can use the link in the description box
and pin comand so let's get started so
guys first we'll start with the tool
ncto so this is the website or the
GitHub repository that nto has so just
search nto GitHub and you will find out
the GitHub repository that's just on the
first ranking move to that and if I tell
you about ncto so it's a widely Ed tool
and that is used by penetration testers
cyber Security Professionals and ethical
hackers and it helps identify potential
vulnerabilities in web applications it
was developed by Chris suo and is part
of the open-source security testing
methodology manual so ncto performs
comprehensive test against web server
for multiple items including over 6700
potentially dangerous files or programs
and checks for outdated versions of over
1,250 servers and version specific
problems on over 270 servers if we talk
about key features of ncto so it has
comprehensive scanning and ncto can
detect a wide range of vulnerabilities
including server misconfigurations
default files and programs insecure
files and Scripts and outdated software
versions and it has an extensive
database nto uses a robust database of
non vulnerabilities which is regularly
updated to include the latest security
threats and issues and it has
customizable testing users can customize
the scanning process by specifying
parameters such as the target host port
and the scan type nto also supports
plugins to extend its functionality and
then comes the feature reporting so nto
can generate detailed reports in various
formats including plain text XML and
HTML I will show you guys how we can
generate that and it makes it easier to
document and share scan results and if
we talk about advantages so the
advantages number one is ease of use so
nto is straightforward to use with a
simple command line interface that
requires minimal configuration and this
is open source so being an open source
tool nto is free to use and can be
modified to suit specific needs making
it accessible to individual
and organizations of all sizes and it
has an active community so because of
that the users and developers who
contribute to its development and
provide support and ensures that it
remains up to date with the latest
security Trends and we talk about some
limitations so it has noise generation
ncto can generate a lot of network
traffic and may trigger intrusion
detection systems that is IDs making it
less suitable for stealy assessments and
if we talk about basic scanning so while
Lio is great for identifying non
vulnerabilities it may not detect more
complex security issues or zero day
exploits for comprehensive security
assessments it should be used alongside
other tools so let's get started with
installing it you can find the
repository and you could see here all
the files the programs they have return
and if you go in the read me section you
can find the full documentation just
click on that and you could have the
whole overview history and trivia and it
is based on the Pearl language and if
you want to install on the docker
Windows Cali so they have all the things
and if you want to see the usage that
would be if you want to use it for the
basic testing purpose you can have the
look here you can use the commands and
if you want to scan multiple host you
could do that too and if we get back so
this is the whole documentation you can
have a look on it
and here most probably all the usages
you could have a look and now we'll move
to install it so you can clone the
repository on your system for that you
should have get installed and use the
command get clone and after that the
repository name so for that we'll open
the terminal if you want to install with
the git as this is the open to system
and I don't have the git get installed
here so you just have to write the
command get clone copy the file or not
the file but the link and paste it here
and you could go in with the cloning
thing and after that you could navigate
the program directory and run it using
the PE command so to install Necto you
just have to write the commands I will
show you guys so just write first what
you can do is sud sudo app
update and he is asking for for the
password I'll provide
him so he has updated all the packages
and now what we'll do we will install
ncto as I've already installed but I
will write the command for you guys so
sudo appt install
ncto so you could see that he is leading
packages that is done done done and nto
is already the newest version that is it
is already installed in the system so
with this command that is Pudo app
install ncto you can install the ncto on
your system and after that to use it and
that's a basic command that is ncto
minus H and the server name or you could
use the IP address like you could use
three methods to search with ncto that
could be IP address to SCAN local
servers web domain to check public
websites or SSL or HTTP websites that is
to test secure websites also so here we
will have a website and to ensure you
guys so use this tool just for ethical
use we are not promoting it to use it
for any black at hacking purposes and we
are also using to just scan the
vulnerabilities and we won't be showing
much of it as we don't promote these
kind of
activities so you could see that it has
started the process that is the target
IP Target host name Target Port that is
443 and the target time so he is
running and for2 and Mac OS you can also
install it and for the ethical
considerations always use these tools
ethically and legally and ensure you
have explicit permission to scan any
website or server unauthorized access or
scanning can lead to legal consequences
and damage to your rep reputation so
kindly have this question with you so
it's a time-taking process so this tool
works with the port number and where the
website is hosted so all these things
matter for the scanning purpose or
getting the vulnerabilities
checked so till then nto is scanning the
website I will show you guys the nvd
website so this is National Institute of
Standards and Technology National
vulnerabil
database so this is the US government
repository of Standards based
vulnerability management data that is
represented using the security content
automation protocol and this data
enables automation of vulnerability
management security measurement and
compliance so what vulnerabilities you
are finding here you can go on and
search on here on this website as this
is the basic foundation for all these
tools
so guys as it is taking more time I will
show you guys more features of ncto till
then so we are in the new window and
till then it happens we'll see more
features so what you can do is you could
write nto minus help and you can get all
the commands that are used by ncto and
after this we have seen the basic syntax
where you could just write ncto minus H
and the IP or the host name and if we
know that the Target website is an SSL
site that you are targeting so we can
specify with the ncto command I'll will
show you guys what you can do that is
ncto minus H and what you want to
specify that could be IP or host name so
I will just write HTTP and what you want
to specify and after that you just write
minus SSL so by adding SSL to the end of
the command the ncto knows that the
targeting website is an SSL site so this
was about the SSL website and if you
want to scan an IP address first you
need to do is IP
config and that to in Kali Linux as the
command is we have to install the dev
name and you could find the if config
and you can also scan any HTTP website
here that is by using ncto minus H and
then the website URL and let's see it's
still doing so till that guys I will
tell you about the other tools that is
nuclei so nuclei is also a fast tool
that is used for vulnerability scanning
and that is based on simple yml command
based templates and it is used for
security Automation and it is capable of
scanning for a wide range of
vulnerabilities across websites networks
and CVS
nucle GitHub and you could see the
repository here and similarly you can
install the nule if you want to work
with nuclei and you could get all the
information in the read me section so
how it works and how you can run on your
targets and how you can install it so
for installing you would just go with
this command and how to use it that's
also same that is nucle minus H and then
you have to write the IP or the domain
name so if we talk about its key
features so it is customizable it uses
yml templates to Define scan rules and
the performance it is designed for Speed
and efficiency and it is versatile that
scan for various types of
vulnerabilities and similarly we have
another tool that is trivy trivy scanner
or just we will move to trivy GitHub so
trivy is a comprehensive security
scanner for container images file
systems and kubernetes
it identifies vulnerabilities
misconfigurations and sensitive data and
if we talk about its key features so it
has container scanning that examines
doal images for non vulnerabilities file
system scanning analyzes files and
directories for security issues and
kubernets integration it checks for
security Flows In kubernets cluster for
the installation purpose you could just
move to read me section and you will
find all those details how's the Journal
usage and both these nuclei and triy are
robust tools that offer unique
capabilities for scanning across
different environments and enhances the
security of web applications containers
and kubernets clusters so these are all
three tools like there are many tools
that you can use and what we have done
with this we have done with ncto and you
could see that he has completed the
process of scanning and what I told you
is this is the target IP host name port
and the start time and you could see
that for the server cloud front he has
retrieved the header and he has found
some issues that is uncommon header with
contents and he has found no CGI
directories and if you want to force
check all possible directories you can
use minus C command for that so we won't
be discussing these vulnerabilities if
you want you can check them out on the
anid website and he has checked 654 four
items and zero errors and nine items
reported on remote host so he has
reported them so this is how we scan any
website for vulnerabilities and you
should have the authority or the command
or the consent for any website to check
before that so with that guys we have
