hey guys welcome back to another video
by simply learn in today's video we're
gonna be learning all about functions in
c but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our channel already make
sure to hit the subscribe button and the
bell icon to never miss an update so now
without any further delay let's begin
this session will help you to understand
what functions are in c
next function definition and declaration
later types of functions in c and
finally different categories of a
function
now let's get started with what
functions in cr
a function is a set of statements that
perform a certain task to generate an
output
we use functions to avoid the repetition
of coding c programs
functions can be called n number of
times and c allows multiple functions in
a program
now let's look at the structure of a
function
in a function header we have written
type function name and a list of
arguments and the body of a function
inside the curly brackets
now let's have a look at the function
definition in c
in the even below function definition
example we have int as a data type
product as a function name followed by
parameters ca and v
next the body of a function consists set
of statements to perform certain
operation so in this particular example
we gonna perform a product of two
numbers
up next we have function declaration in
c
a function declaration is also known as
a function prototype in c
there are some important things to know
about function declaration and the first
thing is that the function prototype
must be placed before the main function
and if the function definition is placed
before the main function then the
function prototype is unnecessary in the
program next function declaration may or
may not contain parameters rather it may
have only data types of variables
then the function header must match the
function
declaration syntax of a function
declaration is return type function name
and parameter list
for example
int product and data types if required
we can also specify variables along with
the data type like int ea comma int b
now that we know function definition and
declaration in c language let's move
ahead and understand the types of
functions in c
c has two types of functions and they
are
library functions and user defined
functions
library functions are built in functions
or we can also see predefined functions
in the header file for example functions
like square root string length printf
scanf etc are predefined functions in c
to use library functions in dc program
we include a header file corresponding
to that function
functions that the user defines are
called user defined functions
let's consider the below given example
we have three important features
function prototype function call and
function definition
a function prototype is declared before
the main function next calling a
function is done inside the main
function and then comes the function
definition in which we have a set of
statements to be executed
let's now look at some different
categories of functions in c
first functions with no argument and no
returning value
next function with arguments but no
returning value
then functions with no argument and
returning value
and last functions with arguments and
returning value
let us understand them with the help of
our programs
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for

the link in the description to know more
so this program is function with no
argument and no written value as you can
see we have declared function prototype
function call and function definition
in which we have function with no
argument and no written value
and we're going to perform
multiplication operation using user
defined function
now let's run the program
according to the values of a variable 5
and 10 we got an output 5 into 10 is
equal to 50.
now let's run the program using a
function with arguments
and no written value
and let's perform the same operation
that is multiplication
as you can see product of two numbers is
equal to 50 and we got an output
next program is using a function with no
argument and with written value
to get a written value we have a data
type int
let's run it
as you all can see we got an output
product of two numbers is equal to 50.
last program to execute is function with
arguments
and written value let's run it
so the output is product of two numbers
is equal to 50.
so with this we have come to the end of
this session on the functions in c
programming i hope this session was
informative and interesting until next
time thank you stay safe and keep
learning
