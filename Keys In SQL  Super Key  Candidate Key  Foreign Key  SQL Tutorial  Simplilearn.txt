Interest so having said that without any
further delay let's get started with our
SQL Keys starting with the primary key
so the primary key uniquely identifies
each record in a table ensuring data
integrity and acting as a reference for
relationships with other tables for
example if you have a employee database
then each and every employee will be
having their own employee ID and that
particular employee ID will act as a
bridge between two or more tables when
you're creating a join so let's also
take care of a few points to remember
when it comes to primary Keys primary
key is how you designate a column as a
primary key during a table creation so
whenever you create a primary or let's
say you're creating a new table then
let's say you know which key has to be
assigned as a primary key in our case if
you're creating an employee data table
then you know that employee ID will be
your primary key but SQL will not know
it so to let the SQL know you have to
dedicate or you have to designate in
terms of primary key right you have to
specifically mention the primary key
keyword in order to designate that
particular column or that particular
value as a primary key and only then the
SQL will understand it next is enforcing
uniqueness understand how a primary key
prevents duplicate records maintaining
data accuracy so primary key is the one
key which ensures that the duplication
is not done and every entry or every tle
is a unique entry next relationships
explore how many primary Kee establish
relationships between tables for
efficient data retrieval now let's
consider the example so here you can see
the employee data table and the first
one which is the highlighted column is
the primary key which happens to be the
employee ID now the second key which is
foreign key the definition for a foreign
key the foreign key establishes
relationships between Tables by linking
a column in one table to the primary key
in another maintaining referential
Integrity now a few points to remember
first one creating foreign key
relationships understand the syntax for
defining foreign key constraints second
one is Cascade actions learn about own
delete and and on update actions to
ensure consistency across link tables
third one importance of foreign Keys
explore real world scenarios where
foreign keys are crucial for a database
Integrity now what is a foreign key so
foreign key let's say you want to uh
link two tables right when you link two
tables based on a primary key and the
dependent columns or the dependent
values on the primary keys that you want
to operate on are called as forign keys
and remember the actions on delete and
on update so sometimes when you update
something on a table then that
particular table will be only uh
actively having the updated values or
deleted values will be removed from that
table but what if the table which is
relied on the first table also needs to
have that update right in such scenarios
that action will not be happening so
unless you use the word Cascade or the
keyword Cascade Cascade on delete right
in that scenario both the tables will be
eliminated from the value which you want
to delete from both the tables so this
is some importance now let's look at an
example on foreign key so in this
particular example the foreign keys are
Department IDs which are related on the
primary key which is ID right so now
let's move on to the next type of key in
SQL which happens to be unique key the
definition for The Unique key unique
Keys ensure that values in a column or a
combination of columns are distinct
across the table preventing data
duplication you can also consider unique
key as a primary key in few scenarios
now let's take care of a few points to
remember creating unique constraints
Implement unique keys to maintain data
Integrity use cases and understand
scenarios where unique Keys play a
pivotal role in database design and
lastly performance considerations
explore the impactfulness of unique keys
on query performance now uh remember I
said you can also consider unique key as
a primary key because let's say we
consider the same example of employee
datp here we will be having multiple
employees one primary key is the
employee ID anyways but what Etc or what
else is unique for each and every
employee their email ID but it's not a
primary key but it is unique right it is
unique and every employee will have
their unique email ID nobody will share
one single email ID right it is unique
but it's not a primary key it can also
be considered as a primary key but it is
not officially considered as a primary
key in a database you cannot declare two
primary Keys you will be having one
primary key and you can have multiple
unique Keys now let's move on to the
next type which is about composite key
definition composite key is form by
combining two or more columns to
uniquely identify records in a table
let's say you have a table okay we will
look into this in an example but before
that let's look at the points t remember
creating composite Keys learn the Syntax
for defining composite Keys next one is
benefits explore the advantages of using
composite keys in complex relationships
third one is best practices understand
when to use composite keys and potential
pitfalls to avoid now the table now
let's say we have a table of product and
you have all the values but none of it
them none of them are unique for example
you have the transaction ID and product
ID which were supposed to be unique
right and customer ID which was supposed
to be unique but they are not unique One
customer can have multiple products One
customer can uh order the same product
multiple times right in such scenarios
we don't have a unique key so to create
one unique key we are trying to combine
two or more colums in this particular
instance we are combining transaction ID
and product ID as one value which will
become one composite key and which will
become a unique value right that's what
a composite key is now moving further we
will discuss surre key now let's learn
about the surrogate Keys surrogate keys
are system generated identifiers while
natural keys are inherent attributes
that serve as unique identifiers now
let's look at some of the points to
remember choosing between surrogate key
and natural Keys dwell into the
considerations for making informed
decisions pros and cons we the
advantages and disadvantages of each
approach real word examples explor
scenarios where one type of key may be
more suitable than the other now let's
learn the examples of surrogate keys so
it's a little similar to the unique key
so surrogate key is identified as a
unique identifier some sort of record or
object in a table for example here we
discussed about the email ID right so
this is a little unique to each and
every employee and you can identify a
certain record if you want to uh
identify let's say fifth cord Ric you
can access it through the surrogate key
which is the email ID of uh rek now with
that let's move on to the next uh
important keys in our SQL Keys which
happens to be the candidate key
candidate keys are columns or a
combination of columns that could
potentially serve as the primary key now
let's look at the points to remember
identifying a candidate Keys learn how
to identify and evaluate potential
candidate Keys normalization understand
the role of candidate keys in
normalization process selecting the
primary key discover the strategies for
choosing the most suitable candidate key
as a primary key now let's look at the
example so here we have uh the columns
ID name gender City email Etc so a
combination of keys can be considered as
the candidate key so in this example
both ID and email can act as a candidate
for the tables as they contain unique
values and nonnull values now let's
proceed further and discuss the last
type of keys for the session which
happens to be the Super Key a Super Key
is a set of columns that uniquely
identifies a record possibly including
more columns than necessary to form a
primary key now let's look at some of
the points to remember understanding
super Keys explore how super Keys
Encompass various key combinations
database design implications learn how
super Keys influence the overall
structure of database optimizing super
Keys disc discover techniques for
optimizing super keys for better
performance now let's look at the
example Super Key can contain multiple
attributes that might not be able to
identify Tes in a table independently
for example the table has the following
schema ID name gender City email ID and
Department ID consider that the ID
attribute here corresponds to the
employee ID it is unique to every
employee at the table in that case we
can say that the ID attribute can
uniquely identify as stubbles of this
table so I is a Super Key of this
particular table and with that we have
come to an end of this session you have
mastered the essential keys that are
fundamental for building robust and
efficient relational databases and in
