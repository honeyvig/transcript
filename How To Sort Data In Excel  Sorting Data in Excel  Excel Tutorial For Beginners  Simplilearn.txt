hey everyone welcome to simply learn's
youtube channel in today's session we
will be learning how to sort data in
excel but before we begin let me tell
you guys that we have daily updates on
multiple technologies so if you're a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for
latest technological trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply done now without further ado
let's get started with our one point
agenda that is how to sort data in excel
now let's get back onto the practical
mode
now we are on the excel spreadsheet so
you can see that i have five different
sheets of the same data so why do we
have that so i'll be explaining you how
to sort data for multiple parameters
so firstly we will try to sort data in
the form of numbers right so here let us
imagine that this data is being shared
with you by your manager and he wants
you to sort this data based on the
salary numbers so he wants you to
arrange the data in the form of
ascending order or descending order may
be which will help him find the employee
with the highest salary right so how
could you do that
so it's really simple you could sort the
entire data just within a few clicks so
how would you do that so since you're
focusing on salary select any cell from
the salary column only
right select this particular column and
select any cell in the salary column get
into the sorted filter options and here
select this sort of arrangement you need
that has largest to smallest or the
smallest largest since the problem
statement was to find the highest salary
click on largest to smallest and there
you go so you have tony and the
designation is senior and he works in
iit support and he draws the highest
salary of 80 000
right and there's also another one which
is pepper and she works for the
analytics team
and now
the next sheet
let's get into the sheet too and this
time let us imagine that you wanted to
you know
arrange or sort the data based on the
employee date of joining or date of
birth right again if you wanted to
arrange the data in which you find the
youngest employee or the oldest employee
of the organization you can do that
click on any cell in the date of birth
column and go back to the sorting filter
and here you will be seeing the options
sort oldest to the newest or the sort
the data from newest to the oldest so
since we want the oldest employee select
oldest and newest and there you go so
the oldest employee is alfred who is an
associate designation employee and he
works in the admin department and he's
drawing the salary of 25000
so that's how you can sort the data when
you are trying to sort the data based on
date wise so first we try to sort the
data on the number wise so you can apply
the same for your employee id salary and
if there is any possibility you can do
that as well and if you want to apply
the same sorting based on dates you can
do that as well using the sorting
function in the same way now let's get
back onto the third sheet and here
now uh
single column wise is perfectly fine
there is no issues with that now you
wanted to you know
let us imagine that you have two columns
okay let's eliminate a few columns here
maybe
we can eliminate
the employee id and
okay let's keep a few
columns so we'll just keep employee name
and employee salary okay so here we are
trying to demonstrate if you are uh
trying to sort the data using one cell
in the column b will it maintain its
relationship with the cell a okay
that's our query right so let's see i'll
go a little detail so let us imagine
that you wanted to sort this data based
on highest salary okay so when you do
that will it also impact the cells in
the column a so it will basically impact
but just uh it's a query right any of
you viewers might have that query will i
uh if in case if i try to sort the data
based on this will it affect the cells
on the rest of the data set okay so in
basically it will impact so i'll try to
you know sort the data based on
ascending order
so this is the smallest to largest
and you can see
uh the tony and pepper so since i
selected the cell in the column b it
also impacted the change on the cells of
column a so that's how the sorting works
now we'll get to a little advanced uh
sorting techniques so here we try to i
mean already we try to sort the data
based on numbers based on alphabets
based on uh
you know uh
date date of birth right so i think we
forgot the
ascending or you know sorting based on
alphabets let's do that as well select
any um cell in the column a and go to
certain filter try selecting a to z or
okay let's try to z to it okay so here
you can see the uh names have been
sorted based on the descending order
from z to a right so so far we tried on
alphabets so far we tried on numbers
date of birth and
a couple of more things so let's dig a
little deeper and try to sort based on
colors right so for that you don't uh
you know find that uh extra setting here
in the regular sorting filter so you
might want to get into the data option
and here you'll find another sort
function which is a little advanced so
that's how you do it so since we have
colored in the cell or call loop of
salary select that salary and we're
going with cell value so in the cell
values section select the cell color and
here on the cell color options you'll
have green blue and yellow that's what
we have used in our
cells so let's keep green in the first
position which is on top and press ok
now you will see green has been sorted
to the first position now yellow and
blue are left out so why is that so
because you didn't provide it right so
you can do what that as well i mean you
can always add uh the setting to it
right select any cell go to sort and add
a level and then again select the salary
and sell values to sell colors and now
the cell color in the second position
would be
blue
and that will be on bottom
and they can add another level
the same salary
the cell values will be cell color
and
cell yellow will be somewhere in between
or bottom
okay so based on hierarchy it will be
selecting press ok
and
there you go so you have cell yellow and
blue at the bottom
and green add the top position as per
your suggestions
now we are on the last sheet so here in
this last sheet we are going to you know
dig a little deeper into the advanced
sorting methods so
previously we tried to apply the
advanced sorting methods for colors now
we'll try to apply the advanced sorting
methods based on the data set we have
here i mean the data we have in our data
set right so select the sort option and
let's add a few details right so
firstly let's sort the column
employee id
okay
so let's have the smallest to largest or
yeah now that would be good now let's
add another level where we will sort
okay i think
we will sort based on employing name
that would be a little better so
let's try to
[Music]
sort it on
employee name here and here will be
employee salary
okay now the cell values and this would
be from a to z and the salaries will be
from smallest to largest so basically
what we are trying to do is we are
trying to sort the employee list based
on employee names from a to z so the
employees name starting from a to z will
be ordered first and another subset of
the sorting will be done based on
highest salaries that is smallest to
highest so let us imagine that we have
three employees with names starting from
a
and their salaries are 10 000 twenty
thousand and thirty thousand so how
would it sort so it will sort basically
uh in the alphabetical order first so
first three names will be sorted and
then it will also have another condition
to sort the data with keeping the lower
salary on top and higher salary and the
last
right so this is how the algorithm works
for sorting now let's press ok and see
the output
so there you go the names are alfred and
you have the highest salary here
smallest to highest so this is 25 000.
next we have banner barnes and ben
so here you might be seeing why we have
been in the third position despite he
has the lowest salary and name starts
with b right so here it is trying to
work based on the alphabets in the order
right so b a and b e it's not just
comparing the first letter it's also
comparing the following letters as well
right so n comes first r comes later so
barnes is squished to the second
position a comes first and e comes later
so b a letters are pushed to the first
position and ben is pushed to the third
position so that's how it works right so
accordingly the set for ba is created
here 3540 next ben 12 and next you have
bobby brian brock chris clark right so
that's how the data has been organized
and sorted based on multiple levels of
parameters you provide for sorting so
that's how you use sorting in excel and
with that we have come to an end of this
tutorial on how to sort data in excel
