learning helps to get more command over
a subject it also enhances your skill
and improvises your performance in this
day-to-day life the development of
software has grown much and shown more
impact all the knowledge on development
comes from coding and programming so we
bring you some tips to learn and get
experience over coding and programming
with without any
difficulty hey everyone welcome back to
a whole new session from Simply learn
today we will be discussing about coding
or programming tips in this session I
will help you learn coding and
programming in a simple way let us have
a look for the agenda for today's
session first we shall begin with
understanding what exactly does the term
coding means followed by that we will
understand what is programming then we
will get in touch with learning the
differences between coding and
programming after that we shall focus on
discussing some important tips to learn
programming and coding and finally we
will end our session by discussing the
benefits however before we begin make
sure that you have subscribed to our
YouTube channel and don't forget to hit
that Bell icon so that you can never
miss an update from Simply learn so
without further Ado let's get started
with our first topic of this session
what is coding computer does not
understand the human language so in
order to communicate with the computer
we use some languages for communication
that requires coding coding is a way of
passing and translating the instructions
for communication with the computer
moving forward let us understand what
exactly programming means programming is
a process of Designing and building
executable programs to work on specific
tasks that involve analysis generation
and implementation of algorithms
many of the applications and development
involves and uses
programming this is all about
programming now let's get started with
learning some differences between coding
and
programming coding is a part of
programming used to help in converting
the language into binary codes which can
be able to communicate with the computer
whereas programming is a process that
works on creating specific tasks
according to the standards the next
difference is that the the coding is a
basic step in implementing the software
whereas programming deals in the depth
of the implementation and dealing with
complex problems coding works with
simple projects which can be finished in
a shorter period whereas programming
deals with big projects and possesses
complete analysis in the implementation
of the
projects there are some fundamental
differences between coding and
programming now let's have a look at
some of the best tips to learn program
programming or coding so some of the
best tips to learn coding or programming
are practice consistency in Reading deep
learning jumping directly into the
learning part online resources for
reference learning how to debug a
program and finally to learn how to
represent your project let's dive deep
into these tips the first one we have is
practice practice is the best way to
learn coding or programming it takes
takes a lot of time to represent but
helps more in gaining knowledge when you
apply for a software job there will be a
technical round and they will ask you to
write some codes practicing helps you to
clear those rounds and get an
opportunity to clear those rounds quite
quickly it also improvises the ability
to identify the mistakes by
yourself the next we have is the
consistency in reading the main problem
in learning is the consistency when we
work on our free time it doesn't help
much because of the power of our brain
going on working daily helps to gain and
boost up your knowledge and helps to
think logically and improve our skills
so we have to work every day to learn
coding or programming the next tip of
the session is deep learning when you
get deeply involved in the subject we
are learning it provides a way to gain
more knowledge and attention over a
subject the deeper we put in an effort
the more we get back it also helps us in
improving our thinking skills it boosts
the performance while performing the
tasks the next step of the doc is
jumping directly into the learning phase
if you're going to learn something you
must start somewhere it helps to predict
and provide a complete understanding of
upcoming topics if you learning coding
or programming you better start from the
basics it helps you more to grab the
attention over the subject and improve
your coding and programming knowledge
and the next one we have is online
resources one of the accessible sources
of learning programming or coding is the
online resources there are a plenty of
online resources like simply learn and
Etc these platforms are providing and
helping much in learning they also offer
free courses and videos with the best
Concepts that you have ever seen my
choice amongst most of the platforms is
simply learn which helps you improve
your coding skills and moving forth the
following tips we have the debugging
making mistakes in code and programming
are very common they are the key
producers of
learning so it is good to use debugging
to improve your coding or programming
skills if you're good at debugging then
definitely you'll learn quite quickly
without any
hassle and most importantly the final
tip of the session is representing
representing the concept you learned
plays a crucial part in learning it may
help to get more ideas and think more
profoundly about the subject teaching
someone discussing and sharing will help
to get more command over coding and
programming so it is good to represent
everything that you learned so these are
a few tips to help you learn coding or
programming now you have an idea of
coding and programming tips now let us
see some benefits of coding or
programming coding or programming are
playing a very massive role in present
day-to-day life they are showing the
capacity to do anything in the present
let us see some of the benefits of
coding and programming coding helps in
improving presentation skills developing
creativity helping in problem solving
and teamwork there are the best known
benefits of coding and programming let
us see some brief information about the
benefits of coding and programming
coding and programing pramming help in
building self-confidence in a person
while dealing with projects they are
helping in improving soft skills and
presentation skills programming and
coding also help in improving creativity
while dealing with the applications and
projects they use much creativity to
develop those they require a lot of
creative
knowledge coding and programming also
helps in situations like problem solving
using these it is easy to find solutions
to complex problems perfectly
while working with the projects require
a team teamwork helps to gain more
knowledge and more experience it also
helps to improve communication and
project management skills and this was
all for today's session I hope you guys
found it interesting and informative if
you have any questions or queries then
please let us know in the comment
sections below our team of experts will
be happy to resolve all your queries
until next time thank you stay safe and
keep learning
