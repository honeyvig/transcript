ERS YouTube channel where we will be
learning how to create your first fire
frame you have probably seen the term
wireframe spoken if you have explored
the interesting topic of UI and ux
design and designing a product in walls
wire framing but what are wireframes and
what makes Amazon chill so in this
tutorial we will cover everything you
need to know about wireframes so without
any further delay let's move ahead for
our session but before we start if you

we will Begin by examining what is
wireframe what are the purpose of
wireframe with this we will see the
different types of wireframe what is
included in wireframe and what tools are
used to create the wireframes we will
Begin by understanding what is wireframe
a website service can be designed using
wireframes and is frequently utilized to
layout functionality and content on a
page while considering users need and
journey and before adding visual design
and the contents to the page the basic
wireframe and the framework of the page
is established using wireframes early on
the development process it is a double
structure sketch of a web page or app
comparable to the visual interface
design in wireframes Style
color
and Graphics are typically kept to the
minimal because they represent the
initial product concept depending on the
level of information required wireframe
can be created either digitally or
manually the most frequent users of
wireframings are ux designers before the
developers begin writing code for the
interface this approach enables all the
partners to agree on where data is
placed and will place the data digitally
or no after knowing what is wireframe we
will understand its purpose
wireframe having three main advantages
they keep the concept and they are quick
and inexpensive to produce because they
stimulate users feedback kick off
conversation with the stakeholders and
Inspire Innovations in designers
wireframes are helpful as Communications
too the designers can receive direct
feedback and identify key problems that
help them to create the proposed product
by conducting users testing during the
first wireframe stage
they clarify and describe website
functions and they maintain the concept
users focus with particular wireframing
features you may explain exactly how
they will work to your clients and what
function they will sell and it has all
the stakeholders combine the website's
information architectures with its
visual design and make the page
operational flip
the third one is quake and cheap the
best thing about wireframing is how easy
and affordable is it to create them you
can design a wireframe with a newspaper
paper and Pen thanks to the abundance of
tools you can quickly develop a digital
wire frame the consumer is typically
less likely to be honest about their
early thoughts whenever a product is
highly polished the longer a period is
developed the harder is to make the
change
thank you
after understanding the purpose of the
wireframe we will see the different
types of Firefly
and the first one is low Fidelity
wireframes and they are very simple
eventual depiction of the web pages and
are typically used as a designer's
foundation as a result they usually lack
of all the sense of Grid or pixel
accuracy and tend to be quite sloppy it
contains basic pictures block forms and
dummy contents including fillers text or
labels with the headlines and they leave
out any information that would serve as
a possible distraction these are useful
for starting conversation selecting
navigations layout and mapping users
flow
and the second one is made fertility
wireframe the most popular of the tree
while they avoid distractions like
graphics and distracting fonts they
mostly focus on specific features
distinct from one another
headings and body materials could
potentially be separated using different
X feet although remaining in black and
white artists can convey the prominence
of specific features through various
shades of tree
these are typically produced using a
digital wireframing program such as
sketch of balsamic even if they are
still useful in the early stages of a
design
the third one is High Fidelity Wi-Fi
finally the pixel specific layouts are
features of High Fidelity wireframes
they may have actual featured images and
textual information unlike low Fidelity
wireframes they are the best choice for
exploring and capturing ideas menus or
interactive maps because of their
additional depth and Rising wireframes
should be safe for the last stages of
the products Desiring cycle
now what is included in the wireframe as
we briefly said previously whether a
wireframe is low mid or high quality is
greatly affects how many details are
contained however elements like
treadmakers searching areas headings
share buttons and placeholder tags are
frequently seen in wireframes so the
first one is information design
by illustrating the rules between the
pages wireframe relates the web database
is structure to its visual design among
other things explain how it should
display specific type of information
consistently on the interface identify
the interface primary use of the
functionality
the second one is navigation design
assign structure comprising all the
components is structured so users can
easily discover informations via frames
navigation charts and Etc to develop a
flowchart of your website you will be
evaluating sorting grouping and linking
comparable information during this
process
and the third one is interface design
the method designers use to create
useful software interfaces or electronic
devices emphasizes Aesthetics or Styles
designers strive to produce users
friendly and enjoyable interface user
interface design and other types such as
voice control interfaces are called UI
design it's a vital to remember that
because wireframes are two-dimensional
they don't work well for displaying the
interactive elements of the users
now we will discuss what tools are used
to create the wireframes
three best wireframe tools are the first
one is figma
as a potent cloud-based substitute for
the applications like sketch and XT
figma stands out the best thing is that
it offers a range of usual capabilities
whether you are freelance designer or a
member of a large team with no
registration for free users there are
many available free wireframes tool
figma is a fantastic alternative if your
team wants one simple tool for the
entire creative process but it's also a
great option if you are a tight budget
you may discuss admap users Journey with
figma and a digital whiteboard that
consists with figma without exporting
your ideas to another design program
proceed directly to wireframing and
testing
second one is Adobe XD Adobe XC sends
out as a user's friendly choice for
wireframing and UI design task even
though Adobe Technologies are famous for
being content and challenging to learn
within XD you can do anything from
wireframing to simple prototyping
additionally X is simple UI is a breath
for fresh air in the comparison to
certain other features which adopt XC
tools
the second one is sketch sketches
remained a Top Choice among Mac users as
important yet portable Vector design
tool wireframes cut temporary UI and
symbol graphic art some interaction
design and more can all be done within
on their own compared to the industry
leader the vector design Atomic
designers and Adobe Illustrator it has a
simpler and more user-friendly interface
because of the sketch Simplicity
wireframe may be quickly constructed
using a combinations of templates and
graphic shapes
so guys I have an empty page and I'm
going to start my design right away so
for that first I will take one rectangle
with the effect of gradient
and I will align it here and you know
size so what I'm going to have a picture
which I've already downloaded so what
I'm going to do is to take that picture
right into my screen
and now I'm resizing it
and the size is okay
so next thing I will do is to add in a
text so I'm going to select
the text
and click here and some basic
configurations there
for my text and I need like to say it
takes to be complete and bold but before
I will go ahead and I will type
I'll be
eight
for the configuration of my text
I will make it bold
and I will just go ahead
and we'll change the color
s say I can
white so now I will
put the button over here
but before that I will align it later up
I will change the color
hi the name
will change the configuration will
change the size
sorry this would be
and store the little light color
some other color that could match with
the background
some let me know what you think about
this splash screen and if you have any
other great ideas on how to bring out a
good flat screen let me know in the
comment section below
and for now we are going to proceed with
further with the home design and the
next flash design so guys the next thing
I want to do is the home as I said
earlier so we will copy this first
I will place it over here
or we can choose any other plane
rectangle
we will see you from here
now I will pick the line
keep this here
okay
and I'm gonna copy this
and then I will
reduce the size
I will again copy this
foreign
and the next thing I want to add a text
and this text should describe or what
you want to select your meal from
different locations maybe at your
workplace in your school or office so
they get the kind of place you select
determines the kind of food that comes
out for you so I'm gonna select a text
and I'll give a text let's say
work please
you're selecting from your workplace so
do the same basic configuration
hit bold
and should let be left a line
now this is fine and I can add more
description to this and the description
should be a little bit easier than what
we have for the workspace and the
workplace so I'm going to make a
description of size
a little small
text actually
like
choose your delicious meal
excuse me
foreign
like a more description
so we might so you might want the users
to select the different location so we
can
achieve that with our triangle icon
foreign
foreign
you can also search for food by the name
so I'm going to add search icon
size it
and we'll keep it aligned with this so
we'll look good
and drag it to this point
yeah and we can keep this
as a white color also yeah it looks good
will make it dark
so next
what I want to do uh quick two icons so
I'm going to create some icons with the
rectangle with some curves so I will add
the icon home over there
foreign
we will search it over here
say this one
and I'm going to drag it into the home
screen
and I will bring it in the center
this way and also going to change the
color or this color is fine okay I'll
change the color
so next thing I will do I'm gonna copy
this
and make it into four places
the same alignment
so I'm going to quickly change the icon
for this this and another this one so
second one I will
foreign
this one
I'll keep us there
my third one
I will use the filter icon
for the fourth we'll use card icon
like this
this one is the active one so we'll keep
this as bright color
and
these are
not active so we will keep it in
light color
yes
so guys I'm having my icons the four
icons that should show me the favorite
mean which I've started offer now this
should show me like a filter screen
where I can filter if I am a vegetarian
same meal that are good for vegetarians
and this should show me the tense card I
have selected to my card then from there
I can payment also so what I am going to
do now
so the next thing I will do is to add
our card
for the different meal where you can
select so I am going to add a card
so what I will need is a rectangle tool
so we'll click on
the rectangle
I have my rectangle tool next thing I
will do a drag in and this slide
and I have a color for this
I will do go with the light color
so next thing
I will do is maybe add the image and I'm
going to select the circle first
within this I will keep my image
put over here

in the circle what to do again image you
can just select the image
from where the image is in your system
and upload it as I already downloaded so
