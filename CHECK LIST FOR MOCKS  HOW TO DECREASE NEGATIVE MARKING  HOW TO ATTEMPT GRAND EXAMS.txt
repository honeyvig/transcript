open module and my screen is visible to
you I need your response on the chat box
yes okay
okay so the most important thing like
before we start the session so it's all
about how to handle the mock exams in
the best way and to improve your scores
and to end up with a good rank okay so
our 100 days plan so I have splitted
that into 60 plus 40. so we are at the
40 days the last 40 or 38 days so we
have left her with the 38 days where we
need to focus more on the mock
examinations okay uh attempting them
analyzing them understanding them and
proper revision building the confidence
is one important part apart from that
apart from that building the concepts is
also important so these are the things
which we focus and uh which we are going
to understand like basically what to be
done okay so my point is these 38 days
you have to see the aerial view of the
preparation
I don't mind uh how your preparation is
like you may come and tell me sir I
don't have not done my preparation great
or I have not started it so I'm planning
to start now but I want to give the best
for these 38 days or I have started in
the last 10 or 15 days or I am serious
from last two months only or there may
be few category of students who are
preparing from last 12 months or 13
months 14 months or last year also there
may be part of MDS Congress students so
different individuals will be at
different levels in this particular race
but the ultimate goal of all of us
including me you and everyone is to give
best for these 38 days so to to get the
best for from these 38 days you require
a best plan
okay so I strongly believe that mock
exams are very very important like if
you talk with any of your senior who got
a decent rank maybe thousand two
thousand or three thousand whatever they
feel it's a decent rank
yeah they feel if their rank is decent
they can confidently tell that okay I
got a good rank to my level of
preparation then definitely they are
going to add a note about mock exams it
can be from anywhere anywhere throughout
the country any Institute Can it can be
but the only thing that's going to make
the student confident and uh make the
student happy after getting the result
is going to be more exams they never
leave mock exams to tag with their
success so planning of mock exams is
very very important okay so maybe in the
initial phases like first four three to
four years we hardly have used to have
only 10 mock exams so then in 2020
because of covid-19 we have improved it
to 15 and the last two batches I mean
the last batch was the highest uh batch
with the highest number of mock exams
from my side the turns around like 20 20
mock exams they have given and now we
are planning more than 25 Market exams
officially I have listed only 25 here
but I'll you the chance or I will make
you to practice more than 25 mock exams
that is a plan because
I was talking to most of the Toppers in
the last few years everyone tagging mock
exams mock exams they have changed the
fate of my preparation so that is the
reason why I give more important so
before going to discuss what to be done
in the mocks and everything okay I have
few common questions from most of you
which I am planning to answer before we
start the particular discussion I think
that we as of now we have 250 plus crowd
okay so I want you to be active if you
have any doubts I'll try to clear itself
okay let's motivate okay it's not about
I always motivating you it's about
motivation from all the sides means you
have to motivate sometimes and we have
to motivate you sometimes it's a it's
more often like a reciprocation like
it's more of an A team work like okay so
whenever we have a reciprocation from
the students in motivation how the
student can motivate you can ask me how
the student can motivate giving exams on
time talking with the mentors okay
interacting with the mentors knowing
your issues discussion with the mentors
so whenever the students are respond
then we will go two steps ahead to work
hard and to make things simple for you
okay right so there were few questions
okay
so checklist to be done okay so so many
are asking like till now I have given so
many checklists okay so whenever you are
in the first phase of preparation I have
given a different checklist now in the
last phase last hundred days plan or 50
days plan I have given a different
checklist now last 38 is along with
mocks I'm going to give a different
checklist and most of you who are
already doing good for example like in
the last three or four exams if you're
constantly maintaining 600 plus you are
or 600 or 550 or 500 plus you are
extraordinary you have a large large
scope and space to improve lots of
things in the last 38 days you can
become extraordinary in this last 38
days because regularly most of the
institutes or it can be MDS conquer if
you take 2018s 19s 20s we used to
conduct mock exams in the last 30 days
only 30 35 40 days only we used to
conduct the mock exams but this time we
were ahead we are already done with most
of the mock exams we are already done
seven to eight mock examinations and
your performance was drastically
improved from exam to exam and that's
his real extraordinary which is required
for the preparation now during check
during mocks and particularly people who
have started recently people who want to
focus seriously recent times okay this
checklist is very very important for you
okay so what do we do what we should
revise for mocks what we should do for
each and every subject of mocks it is
very simple I want you to stick on to
the quick revision videos
quick revision videos quick revision
videos are available for almost all
subjects except for
even I thought of doing quick revision
for a Pro Stock but I strongly believe
whatever that is there in the dental
pulse I have to do it as a contribution
because synopsis of pro stuff or dental
pulse revision the basics of prosto fpd
rpdcd were extraordinary so the quick
revision part of pro store you can do
Dental pulse synopsis
you can do the synopsis part of dental
pulse of CD
RPD
FP
clear done okay so apart from Quick
revision what other things has to be
done okay the next other things what you
have to do is repeats
repeats
repeats aapg repeats a i p g or you will
have a tag like neat repeats
so you have to do repeats from 2022
to
whatever level you can mandatory must do
up to 2017.
even if you want to do from 2016 to 2001
yes it's good if you do but must do what
is must do
22 to 17 must do okay so as of now the
website is having 21
20
19 and 18 okay and within few days we
are going to update 22 along with the
discussion part
17 anyway you have examination on 23rd
and I hope most of you have already
started the
2017 repeats exam is there on 23rd and I
hope you have already started it
okay right so repeats has to be done
okay so repeats means for every question
paper like for example you say 2021
question paper you'll have 14 questions
from each subject so if you're doing
2021 question paper okay uh or 2020
question paper you are going to cover
all the subjects balance link and you
are going to cover 14 topics from each
subject on a particular day on day on
the day in which you are doing the
question paper well the third important
thing is whatever that is being posted
on the group
so you have your WhatsApp groups as of
now we have three groups
one two and three differentiated by
three hard symbols and in these three
groups MDS Congress Trend was around
like 1500 1500 plus students are there
live about how many are active but
fifteen hundred people are there in
these three groups so most of the
information whatever that is being
shared okay is important for exam and
all controversial questions because most
of the people they keep on asking the
questions so what we do we do we revise
all the controversial questions which
are posted personally as it doubts to
Stu that's as it doubts to me or any of
the staff so we discussed that questions
we discuss very important questions we
discuss controversial questions we
discuss PP books so lots of things we
discussed which are important for exam
on the group
the fourth important thing is mock
examinations
mocks and exams
that
has
to be done or things that has to be done
so whatever I'm mentioning okay exams
that has to be done or things that has
to be done whatever I'm clearly
mentioning on the group they have to be
addressed they have to be done they have
to be addressed okay so these are the
four golden things that you have to
follow and exceptions people who are
exception for this people who are
already doing good people who are
already maintaining 600 plus in them
Grand examinations in the mock
examinations and the model examinations
you I hope you're already done with most
of these things okay I hope you're
already done with prickly Vision I hope
you are already done with repeats I hope
you are already doing the group stuff
and I hope you're already following the
things on it so there's nothing very
special for you to do extraordinary
you're already done with this uh in the
in the in this like round two or round
three okay so you go with your plans
whatever notices you have prepared by
seeing the smart videos and whatever
plans strategies you are following
whatever mcqs you are doing from sources
like Dental pulse dentists or PP books
and whatever it is you're doing do it
from your side this is very specifically
for the people one category of people
who are not giving exams regularly who
are to start the preparation for it to
be serious in the preparation or maybe
for the students who are not able to
achieve that 500 marks still moving uh
around 300 400s okay I want you to focus
more on these things is it clear guys
checklist to be done during the mocks is
it clear I need your response your
doubts everything will be uh clarified
after after the session so first time uh
my point is I need to discuss few
important things so I'm discussing it
okay done thank you next comes is how to
solve how to solve exams so coming to
mock exams how do you solve so the best
way of solving the mock exams is you I
want you to keep keep a separate book of
200 pages long book for mock exams good
cost good book preferably I want you to
keep a classmate book for these mock
exams and get some highlighters okay
boys most of even if you don't use
highlighters get some good pens okay
four or five colors red color green
color whatever colors are available get
some Four Color spins multiple pens and
get some highlighters and get a good
book
before you start any Grand examination
which is already done or which is at
Twitter say it eight are already done
okay rest of things are add to them
so keep the grand exam name
and the and and the number of Grant exam
and when you are attempting the question
paper when you're attempting the
question paper I want everyone to keep
these two columns one column for the
question number which is unknown for
example you read a question number and
you don't know the question number you
don't know you don't know the you don't
know the concept you have you heard
that's the first time you have heard for
example there is some caries activity on
a carries activity or cpit an index you
don't know
so you for example CPI DNA index uh
question is question number four unknown
concept or unknown topic so you are
going to add letter 4 there means this
fourth question I have never heard I
have never practiced okay second one you
have already practiced okay but you have
already practiced same question again
cpitn you have already practiced you
know it you have solved it but while
attempting the question you are confused
between two options it means you are
confused with this topic you are not
clear with this topic this topic
requires revision
so for example now there is a question
on Jones are zones of fish or zones of
dental caries animal carries you know
from childhood that is from BDS level
also you know but when you are
attempting the question you feel it's
confused okay am I should I go for
option b or should I go for option C
you'll confuse but you know this topic
so this is called as known topic but you
are confused or you are not clear
so for example question number eight is
on zones of Dentin and dentinal Carries
you are confused between the zones the
sequence of Jonesville is slightly
confused so you have to write the
question number there
right so once you're done with the exam
once you are done with the exam all
these questions Unknown Known but not
clear you have to highlight so I'll
write here what I'll write
dentinal
here is
Jones now where I confuse I am going to
write I'm going to write the four zones
in the sequence and I'm going to stress
it before you go for next examination
I'm going to read this for example this
is in Grand examination 8 it was done so
before giving a grand examination nine I
am going to read this book before giving
Grant examination 10 I'm going to read
this before giving Grand examination
level I'm going to read this I'm going
to read this n number of times until I
become perfect with this concept and if
any question is coming from this area
I'll never lose I'll write and I'll read
that number of times so that I'll be
strong in this concept which I felt I am
weak at one point
similarly once you are done with the
exam you will have some 20 unknown
questions roughly I'm telling few few
people may have more than that if you
have not started the things seriously
the number may be more okay or if you
known known uh confused topics can be
somewhere around 20 25 so make sure you
read them properly spend some quality of
time with these questions read them
properly and understand them properly
and if you want to write anything very
short that you have to revise before you
go to the next Grand examination it has
to be written in this particular book
itself
or else you have one option on the
website where you can write notes there
itself you can write notes and you can
mark it you can mark that that question
you can write notes and whatever you
want whenever you want you can you can
you can revise them opening that
particular question
this is the this is one important thing
that if you implement these things you
can see extraordinary changes in your
scorings and in your performance in the
final exam this is an extraordinary
principle that I strongly recommend
everyone to follow you
is it clear guys
topic 2 how to solve exams how to be
more effective in exams how to improve
your scores and exams
done can I move to the third question
that is most frequently Asked nowadays
by the students
yes the third important question is
how to decrease negative marking and how
many questions to attempt
okay so this is a this is this question
the answer for this question varies from
Individual to individual for example I
have seen few mentors or When I Was
preparing I I'm my mentor told to
attempt 230 plus
out of 240
if negative marking is there in the exam
we used to have exams which doesn't have
negative marking also
you have it you have to attempt
everything if negative marking is there
see this is what my mentors used to tell
but this principle is not applicable for
all the students this principle is
applicable only for the students who are
already doing good for example you're
already doing good you are already doing
good 500 plus 600 plus then you can atom
230 nothing wrong but if you are not up
to mark on the preparation okay so you
have to you should not item 230 you
should attempt basing upon your ability
basing upon your capability okay so you
can ask me how to decide my ability how
to decide my capabilities or I cannot do
that so I'll tell you few principles to
decrease the negative marking and to
improve your accuracy and make sure you
try to practice these principles and
make sure you try to give the review
back to me so that I can modify a few of
my suggestions for the next batches so
whatever suggestions which I am pulling
now are collected from the previous
batch Toppers previous batch students
interacting with the students analyzing
the analyzing your performances on the
website so make sure I need I need your
feedbacks after following this principle
uh by giving at least five or six Mark
exams so that I will try to modify these
principles so principle number one
principle number one
if you don't know a particular concept
if you never heard a particular concept
there is a key word in the question you
never heard that
you don't know that and in sometimes you
are not able to judge a particular
question is from which subject don't
touch those questions
don't touch them
don't try them don't don't try them
because you are not a scientist you are
not a scientist I'm not a scientist to
invent something in that three hours and
come out with the answer so you cannot
invent something you cannot write
something okay so don't touch and don't
touch and don't waste time on those
questions first golden principle if you
don't know the concept if you never
heard the term the key word in the
question and if you are not able to
decide which subject also
which subject also it is completely
blank for you don't touch them
foreign
neet examination
for every wrong answer you will get
minus 1 square and for every right
answer you'll get plus 4 square and for
every answer you will have four options
and you need to select the best
basing upon the calculations the net
result of need is zero
how it will be different types of
calculations are there by different
matters so my calculation is neet will
have a
B
C D and most of you are preparing well
okay most of your repairing even if you
don't prepare and for example for
example in a particular question you
keep all
every question you keep a and come back
you will have 60 right answers minimum
60 right answers just keep a for all
questions in the entire exam and come
back you will have 60 right answers so
stay means
60 into
4.
how much it is going to be
16 to 460 right times x means 60 into 4
so it's going to turn around
240
and out of 240 60 are right means you
made 180 wrong answers 180 wrong answers
are going to give minus 180.
so even then you will get 16.
even then you are going to get
60 marks
okay so the net cumulative effect of
need is positive only that is the reason
why you see most of your seniors or
mentors are going to tell attempt as
many as possible and come back
attempt more questions and come back
attempt at least 2 30 and come back okay
so net effect of need is zero but what
principle you have to follow for example
you have a question option a option b
option C option D are there
and you know the cons you know the
concept you heard the concept but you
are not clear about the cushion but
luckily you are able to eliminate one
option okay so the answer is in three
three by one three by one is 33.3
percent is okay so now the chances of
getting a right answer is 33.3
percentage which is more effective
normally your chances of getting a right
your chances of getting a negative
marking is how much minus one is your
negative marking
so your chances of getting a negative
marking is 25 and chances of getting a
positive score is 33.33 if you are able
to eliminate one option so 33.33 is more
so calculations in mathematics so 33.33
is more I want you to attempt such
questions where you are able to
eliminate one option at least
now second category you have one more
question where you are able to eliminate
two options
so you're left over with two options and
the chances of getting a right answer in
this is 50 percentage your chances of
getting a wrong answer negative marking
is 25 percent which is more this is more
so whenever you are able to eliminate
one option at least in a question
how can you eliminate one option in a
question if you know something about the
question only then only you can
eliminate one option of the question
so if you are able to know something
about the question and if you are able
to eliminate one option make sure you
attempt such questions you are
completely blank don't know never heard
don't return because you are not able to
eliminate an option in it okay so this
is how you have to attempt the number of
questions it's not about how many
attempts your Mentor is telling so your
Mentor May address The Toppers and tell
it to item 230. you may not be in the
topper you have initially started the
preparation so it is 230 is not for you
230 is for the students who are already
doing good how much is for you is you
have to decide basing upon this so see
the question decide whether you have to
attempt it or not don't prepare and go
to examination Hall that whatever it may
be whether it is easy difficult I'll let
them 235 I item 230 because my mentor
told item to that for example by mistake
if the question paper is so easy
and if you know all 240 questions will
item 240 or 230 as your Mentor told it
is just 235 230 or 235 no I'm asking a
very genuine statement 240 you know 240
are easy how many you are going to
attempt 230 has three concerts are told
right
81 230
no no one of us no one of us will do
that okay right so uh this is how you
need to practice so during mock exams
you should decide what is your level
of preparation how far you are going how
many you are able to solve so what is
your figure so overall left or mock
exams the mock exams only will tell okay
I should attempt in this range so that
my effective score will be more
so always focus on the effective score
not on the number of questions you
attempt what is going to determine your
accuracy oh I mean what is going to
determine your marks in the examination
or rank in the exam is it number of
right answers is it number of questions
you attempt
is it number of right answers who are
going to decide your marks or number of
questions you attempt is going to decide
your marks so you practice you have
exams here you practice and decide what
is your range of attempt okay and final
exam also don't go blindly with the
particular number and start digging the
things because sometimes the question
paper may be too tough and you you have
a predetermined mindset that I'm going
to attempt 230 if you are not able to
reach those 230 goals you start you'll
have the depression feeling you have you
lose that confidence in the examination
Hall and this is true it has happened
many many times to many many students
okay clear
clear about this principle principle
number two
yes next comes the principle number
three
whatever hits your brain first
that is right answer
whatever hits your brain first that is
right answer there is one exception for
this
except
until unless you are 100 percentage sure
to change the answer
there is there is one question
one question on some Dean's index or
something okay so I have attempted it
after going to uh 10 or 15 questions
ahead I suddenly strike something in the
brain that that question I went wrong
if you are 100 sure that you went wrong
then only go back and change the answer
if you're still in a dilemma that the
dean's question whether it is answer A
or B I'm not very clear it's only 50 50
then don't change the answer
is it clear
when you should change you're 100 sure
yes 100 sure this is wrong I want to
change go and change
if you are not sure if you are not sure
still 50 50 don't change
and one beautiful thing is practice this
how when you're giving mock examination
when you're giving mock examination you
write down the questions where your
brain is suggesting you to change the
answer and you write down the questions
where you have already changed the
answers so just write the question
numbers where you have changed the
answers where you have thought of
changing the answers and analyze it
after the exam write the question
numbers
between it will only tell if you change
the answer how many are becoming right
if you are changing the answer how many
become wrong clear right third principle
is clear
clear cleared I hope the third principle
is clear I want you to active very
active you should be more active
you are the eighth batch for me and I
have prayed I have prepared for entrance
for three years eight plus three eleven
years I'm doing 11 years from 11 years
I'm doing the same stuff I I should be
an actor you should make me more active
next to Fourth principle
fourth principle
trust yourself in the exam
you should trust yourselves
you should trust yourself in the exam is
whatever you're keeping is right that's
all
even if even if the paper Center has a
different answer he has to change the
mind and come to your answer you should
trust yourself once you trust yourself
only you can go to the next question you
can you can strongly you should
confidently press that next button for
the next question you should be very
confident whatever you kept in the
examination Hall is right that's all
this you have to trust
you should not have that phobia uh that
question is it right or wrong is it
right or wrong means if you are going to
the next question means you are drifting
to the next concept
do you think uh most of your questions
will be on the same Concepts any Mia 10
questions
antibiotics 10 questions implants 10
questions do you think the question
paper will be like this
no so then there is no point like it is
something like uh you you are operating
a class one uh you have done a root
canal therapy in a one patient and
coming back doing an extraction or other
patient so there is no point of thinking
about the old root canal that is done
when you are doing an extraction here
you're doing a magazine surgery on one
patient and thinking about extractions
or like root canals what you have done
in the previous appointment do you think
like that or you do you think about the
patient who is in front of you very
simple you're doing a maxillofacial
surgery okay uh some mandibular
factorial handling you're thinking about
mandibular fracture or think about the
previous one yes but most of you will be
worried about the outcome and we start
thinking about the previous question so
once you press the skip button once you
press the next button no point of
thinking about the previous question no
point about thinking about the previous
concept no point of thinking about the
previous subject it should be very very
very very very clear and I want you to
practice this right away in your mock
examinations
I hope this is very very clear don't
think enough now you have a question in
front of you have a concept in front of
you have four options in front of you
you should think 100 is only about this
not about the things which are already
done
means you should maintain that integrity
you should maintain the Trust on
yourself
because
if you ask me the most important person
for you in your life is
who is the most important person for you
in your life
yes whatever it is the most important
person in the entire life for us is we
okay so a few of you may tell my mother
my father my brother my sister you can
tell me my boyfriend my girlfriend my
wife
but before that my is there my boyfriend
my is there so you always love yourself
so if you love yourself that much and if
you uh and because you you're the one
who is leaving entire life of yours with
you okay tell me what is the answer for
this who is the person who is going to
spend maximum time in your life with you
who is going to spend the maximum time
in your life
yes the answer is same again it's you
okay maybe your parents up to a
particular
but maybe your future once you get
married
there will be in the second half
children after their birth okay friends
a particular time so the one who is
going to stay with you from your birth
to death is you so you should trust
yourself you should respect yourself you
should obey yourself
you should focus only on yourself this
is a golden principle and you have to
follow this in the exam very
specifically I don't know whether you
are following this or not but at least I
want you to trust yourself I clearly
mention trust yourself in the exam in
the examination Hall at least you have
to trust yourself in the examination
hall because in examination Hall no one
is there to help you you have to come
out with the answers right so these are
the four golden principles I'm repeating
again once you don't know the question
you don't know the concept don't touch
it
second one once you are able to
eliminate only one option in a known
concept questions and if you are left or
with three you can attempt such
questions
number three whatever hits your brain
first accept the question where you are
planning to change the answer and if you
are 100 sure then only change the answer
or else don't change the answer
next one trust yourself
okay done so there's one more question
from the student side about this how to
attempt how to how to handle how many
faces you have to do
the question paper particularly MOX if
it is uh if it is a regular subject
specific or two or three subjects uh you
can do whatever you want but if it is on
all the subjects you'll have you'll be
having 20 25 subjects covering 240
questions into four options you need to
solve them within a three hours limited
time with lots of pressure and confusion
so what to be done okay so phase one
phase one most of the questions should
be solved
except
phase two questions
you can ask me sir what are phase two
questions second one I'm talking I will
be talking about that phase two
questions
phase two questions are the questions
which are lengthy
very descriptive part five you line six
lines Channel lines sometimes
even if you know the question skip it
for the phase two don't do it phase one
because it is going to eat time because
we don't know
we don't know how to manage the time
until the question paper is done now
here question questions may be easy
questions may be familiar you don't have
that stress final exam you'll have that
stress you'll be in a new place you'll
be sitting around new people you will be
completely in a new Zone and you are
going to give an exam your brain will
take time to get settled it's not like
regular exams what you are giving at
home or in the offline Center or your
College library which is a familiar face
so brain doesn't require time you'll go
sit start the question rock it and come
back this is not going to happen in the
exam
so that is the reason why we don't know
how much how to handle the question
paper until it is done so that is the
reason why I want you to skip the
lengthy questions
to phase two
questions which are lengthy questions
which requires time
to think
questions which require elimination
method
elimination method to come out the right
answer questions which require
calculations
mathematical questions which require
calculations questions
which are blank for you you know but you
are feeling blank or for example
sometimes classifications questions will
be blank it requires some time for to
get the clear cut idea few people have
have this habit like for example a
question on a classification is being
asked they'll sit they'll close their
eyes and they'll imagine the textbook
page and the textbook page will come not
immediately okay it's not a physic
Network our brains are not physic brains
okay so what is going to do our brain
will take some time to like get that
classification picture Okay so questions
I'll simply add the word questions which
create blankness you know that Ellie's
classification you see a list
classification feel very very happy lots
of adrenal is released but once you see
the options you are blank wait you can
do it in the round two
okay right so these are the category of
questions which has to be done in phase
two
okay so there is something called as
phase three according to few mentors
so your experience mentors they are
going to tell about phase three also I
have seen uh few people telling phase
three
you decide what to be dropped in the
face today phase three during your phase
one and phase two itself
like for example uh I told you right
questions you don't know the concepts
questions you never heard that that is
called as phase three means phase three
is to leave the 10 or 15 questions
whatever you don't know like your
attempt is 225 according to the
difficult index of the paper what to be
leaving what you are planning to leave
in the in the in that 15 questions is
faced in leaving the questions is phase
three according to me so don't divide it
into faces phase one phase two phase
three phase four phase five no we don't
have that much time to divide that
number of faces it is only phase one and
phase two and the last you are left you
may be left over with some 15 to 20
questions now in this 15 to 20 you want
to remove
you want to remove few things you want
to remove few things you want to remove
few things and push them to phase two
okay so what the questions you decide
like you feel like the question paper is
easier you because you know even if you
are not topper you know whether the
question paper is easy or not we can
decide that with a good preparation with
a decent preparation so in the decent
preparation if you are feeling that the
question paper is easy and I'm
attempting only 225 I need to improve my
attempt by five so in this leftover 20
questions what five you have to pick and
attempt is hot you have to decide in the
phase three
no time
it varies
topper may have all questions in Phase
One itself so it's not about time
no time don't keep time you you yourself
have to calculate the time when you're
going through the question papers like
half an hour is done half an hour is
done you can see half an hour that is
over so how many questions you have
attempted so logically in half an hour
how many questions you have 800 you have
to calculate or one hour like for
example it's a 220 240 questions means
by one hour you should attempt more than
80 questions next second hour 80
questions third hour eighty questions
totally it's going to be 240 so by one
hour if you are still at 60th question
you need to speed up so you have to
modify the speed basing upon the number
of questions left over that is required
it's not about uh the time duration that
you need to spend in each phase
okay right I hope this is clear right
this is clear about uh I want you to do
in uh two phases okay two phases phase
one and phase two okay and don't don't
break your heads uh to create n number
of faces yes like your repeats known
repeats single liner questions for
example they're asking me a question was
invented by
what is the answer
was invented by the question
right so most of you have answered it
right
if you don't know the answer for this
you cannot invent rubber Dam there in
the examination Hall okay so there's no
point leave the question and more
if you know the answer you can finish
this question in less than five seconds
so such questions has to be done in
Phase One or repeats you have seen 2022
repeats 2021 repeats chaka chaka finish
it Mark it and move on so that you can
spend a quality of time with
phase two and phase three questions it's
clear right
the main goal is to convert more
questions in Phase One itself so that
you can do good you can spend some
quality of time in phase two and phase
three where you need to think analyze
answer eliminate all these things
clear
clear
