foreign
YouTube channel and in this tutorial we
will learn to create a Discord mode and
add it to our Discord Channel and here
we will learn how to get the following
responses from the board the responses
would be text image video document or
audio if you are aiming to get certified
in Python Programming and want to build
a python software development career in
that case you can check this python
certification course by simple learn
which will open the doors for the best
career opportunities and to find the
details of this python certification
course you can check the link in the
description box below it could be the
ideal solution to help you build your
career in the right direction and before
starting let us have a simple question
to brush upon our knowledge and it's
related to Discord and your question is
what is the minimum age to use Discord
and your options are
the first option is 18
the second option is 13 and the third
option is 15 and the fourth option you
get is none of these so please answer in
the comment section below pause the
video give it a thought and answer in
the comment section first we'll see the
demo of our Discord board and then we'll
start to create our project and for that
we will move to our Visual Studio code
so this is our view of Studio code and
this is the code for uh the simple
Discord port
will also create the music Discord board
but first we'll create the simple
Discord board to just get the responses
from the board as text image files or
video
so we'll save this
and run this
so it shows that we have logged in as
simply learn both
so we will move to Discord and I have
created the simply learn server and in
that I have the simply learn board
we will go step by step and I will show
you how to create a server
and you can see the simply on board it's
active it's showing the green sign or
the Green Dot
and here
we'll see what were the commands
if we just write High
so we are in the general Channel and if
we write High
we get the response from the simple and
board as hello and
if we write image we'll get the image
that is rewind.png and this image is
stored in the same folder as of the
project and if we write video we will
get the python dot MP4 this file is also
stored in the same folder and the audio
will get this song and this file is also
stored in the same folder and if we
write file we'll get the same file that
is python.pdf and that is stored
in the same folder
so I'll show you some commands
uh
I will write image
and the board responds me with the
rewind.png that is stored in the folder
I will show you guys
so
this is the divine.png what I got when I
wrote image
so moving on now we'll start with a
board and I will show you the demo of
music port before creating that
now
the first thing we will do is create a
new folder for our project and we'll
create a folder
and name it as
code board
using
python
and in this folder we'll open the
command prompt
and we will open our
idle that is Visual Studio code you can
use any ideally that you have Hands-On
we will be using the visual studio code
and here
we will create a file and name it as
main.py
and before starting the first thing we
should do is
install and import the libraries and
before starting let us have a simple
discussion about what is a Discord so
this code is a voice and text
communication platform for gamers
players streamers and developers use
this code to discuss games answer
questions chat while they play and much
more it even has a game store complete
with critical reviews and a subscription
service it is nearly a One-Stop shop for
game communities I'll show you I have
downloaded the desktop version of
Discord
so this is a Discord and while there are
many things you can build using Discord
apis this tutorial will focus on a
particular learning outcome how to make
a Discord bot in Python and if I tell
you what is a board so automated
programs that look and act like users
and automatically respond to events and
commands on Discord are called boat
users
so this was the brief about the Discord
and what is the board now we'll start
with how to create a Discord board
so first you should have an account on
Discord
for that you could simply go to the
Discord website and register for that
and you can if you're on desktop you can
download the desktop app or you can
access the Discord within the browser
now you should have an account on this
code
and you should create a server in that
to create a server you can see this plus
sign just click on that that is add a
server and now you can see
for whom you want to create the server
I want to create a server for my friends
and that would be for me and my friends
and
he is asking for the server's name
so we will write
project server
and we'll click on the create button
so we have created a server and it has
channels that is General Games music and
voice channels that is launch and stream
room
now we have created a server now we will
move to this code
development website for that we will
write this code developer portal
and this is the website that is HTTP
colon slash slash disco.com developers
talks intro
so
in this website
we will create a new application so
first we have to go to the applications
and I've created three applications and
here we will create a new application
and name it as
project
we will take all the permissions and
click on the create
and now you could see the general
information about the Discord board
so if you want to upload any icon you
can do that for your board and we have
named it as project
and we can tag it as bot
and
chatbot
and moving on
now
we'll go to the board
okay so first
we will save the changes
and now
we'll go to the board and click on ADD
board and now we have to confirm by
clicking yes do it
now after the boat is added
now we'll copy the board token and
before that
we'll just give the board permissions
and before getting the bot permissions
we'll go to the authorization too
and here
will select in-app authorization
and we'll select the scope as bot and
give the permissions add an
administrator permissions
and here we'll save the change
and in the URL generator
we will
select the scope as board and the board
permissions will cite it as
administrator and we'll copy this URL
and paste it here
just to store that and we will open that
in the browser
we have to open this
in the browser
and here we'll see
the server we have created the project
server we'll select that and we'll click
on continue and it has the administrator
will authorize it and it's asking if we
are a human or not
so we'll just
so let's capture
and you can see that our both is
authorized
so we will see in the Discord
that project just showed up that is the
project board so it has showed up but
it's offline
so now we have to make it online we'll
do it by writing a code
and before that
we have to generate the token
overboard
so in the authorization 2 we have
done the things and here we have
generated
the link and authorized our board now
here
will give the permissions
that is requires authorization to code
Grant
and sentient so member intent okay we
will give all the permissions as we
would be creating the music board also
so
for that we would be requiring the
administrator permissions
and that is all these permissions send
messages create private threads attach
files so that
so here we'll save the changes
and to get the token of a Discord both
we'll click on the reset token
and click on the yes to it so we'll copy
this token
and paste it here so it's a token and
this was the URL to authorize a Discord
mode
so we would be using this token in a
code to activate our board and to get it
online
and if you get your token
mishandle or you have given to someone
you can just reset it so after this
project I will reset this token so you
guys can't use my token
so moving on
now
we will install some libraries that
would be Discord Library
and to install that
I will show you the simple commands
that is present in the browser you just
have to write
install
this code
python
Library okay
and this is the official website
you just have to copy the command
move to a command prompt over the
terminal of your ID and just paste this
command
and
press enter
you can see that the requirement is
already satisfied as I have already
installed the Discord Library so
here I don't have to install it again
and you can do it just by writing the
command in the command prompt over in
the terminal and here we are using pip
to install the command
now moving on
after installing the libraries
and
authorizing our
Discord board now we'll write code to
get a board online and get some
responses from him
so first we'll import the Discord
library and put that we'll write the
command import
Discord
so here we are important the Discord
and now
first
we'll get our Port online and for that
first we'll set the intents
that is
this code
load
intense
not all
and after that
we will
create a variable client and in that
we will call Discord dot client
and inside we'll write command prefix so
if you want to give any command
so if it has the prefix that will enter
so board would understand that
that would be exclamation mark and we'll
set the intents
that is intents
equal to
in minutes we have created a variable
inside the intents
now
we will create a
event that would be client dot event you
could visit the Discord
official website and see the
documentation of how to install it that
is if you want to use the PIP command
you can use that in Linux
and
you could see the voice code by NaCl we
will install it for our Music board and
you can see this is the quick example to
see how we can use the Discord Library
so we have set the intents
and
now
we're gonna make a board active
so you could just visit the
documentation read it once and you would
understand how this library is
functioning and what classes and
functions it possess
so we'll move back to our ideally
and here we will create the event
for that we'll write at the rate
client
that the variable we have created dot
event
and
inside it
will use async
and create a function
that is on underscore ready
foreign
we will print
that we have logged in as
if
board has logged in
it should get printed
we have logged in as
the name of the
user or
a port
okay
and write dot format
and inside will pass client
now
will create another event that is
at the rate
client
dot event
and inside
we will
create another function
that is own underscore message so if we
give any message to a port
he will reply to us
so message
and if
message dot author so he is writing the
message is equal to
client dot user
then we'll just return
and if
message dot content
Dot
starts with that is if the message
starts with high or we can write hello
so a board should respond with something
so if our message starts with high
so we will await
and
message Dot
Channel
dot send
will send hello
and now to
make a board active the last thing we
have to do is
we have to
run a token random board with the help
of token
so you know we have copied the token and
that we have copied here
so I'll copy this
and paste it in client dot run
so we'll save this
and run it
so you could see that
it has shared logging and using static
token
and it has shared the session ID that
the board has been logged in and what we
have printed is that we have logged in
as project hashtag 7634
so here we will move to a
Discord
and here you can see that a board has
been online after we have run the code
that is we can see the green symbol for
that and we have written the commands if
we
write hi to a boat or the message which
starts with high
it would respond to us so you could
directly chat with the board here that
is just click on its
symbol and you can message at the red
project at the red project that is your
board so we'll just write hi here
and you could see that a board responds
with hello
and if we go back to our project server
so this is a project server and if we
write hi in any channel that is we are
writing in general Channel
and press enter
so here also our Port will respond that
is hello
so now we'll add other functionalities
so that a port could respond to us in
different ways so now we will ask our
board to send an image so the image
could be sent through the port in the
form of file we need to give the name to
it and the file should be in the same
directory where our code is it could be
done by running the code that I will
just
show you
so here
now we'll start with if
message
dot content
Dot
starts with
image that is if we have image
oh sorry
that would be heavily that is own
message we are writing in the function
that is own message and if the
message.content starts with image If the
message has image in it
so what we will do is
we will write a command that is await
message Dot channel in which channel we
have quote the command as image from the
author we will write the or send the
file that is the port will send the file
in the same channel that is
message.channel dot send
and here
we will write the file name
and for that
first we'll see which files
so I have some files that I have
used
formerly
so
that I've stored in yeah new folder so
yeah
so these are the files that will ask
about to return us back
that is the image rewind.png python PDF
and the python mp4 file and the MP3 file
beautiful mistakes
so we will
copy all these
and paste in our
directly
in the same directory that we are coding
that we are writing a code
now we'll move back to our Visual Studio
code
and here we'll write
the file name that is
file equal to Discord
Dot file
in your Discord dot file and now the
name of the
file
that was rewind.png
so we'll save this
and first run it to check if this
command is working or not
so first we'll kill our terminal
save it and run it
and we can see that it has given the
session ID and we have logged in s
project board we move
to our Discord
and here we will write image in the
channel
you can see data Port responded with the
rewind.png image
so
a command is working fine
now
after running this code that is the Type
image in the channel now the board will
respond with the image that we have
given in the file and we have seen that
now we will get the video audio and a
PDF file through the board now to get
these
first we must share the file name in the
file section for the file that we need
to share through the board in order to
acquire the video audio or the file
now we need to keep that file in the
same directory where our code is there
as we have seen that we have kept that
in the same folder now
we will write the commands for video
audio and the PDF file
now first we will write the command for
video
and that is if
message dot content
Dot start with
that is video
wait
message Dot
Channel
dot send
here we'll write the file name that is
file equal to
this code
Dot file
and inside
will pass python dot MP4
and that would be in the inverted commas
sorry for cuffing oh
I have a net account
now we have set for the video now we'll
set for the audio file and for that
we'll write the command that is the same
command and we won't waste any time
we'll just copy it
hmm
we should code as fast as we can
and if the message contains the audio
so what will pass we'll just see what we
have
the name of the audio file that is
beautiful underscore mistakes
and that is MP3
beautiful
underscore
I think just check it
and that is yeah I missed capital
so now we have written for the audio
file now we'll write
for the simple file
that is our PDF
so if I command that is the command we
will give to our board if it contains
the name file then it will give us
python dot PDF
okay
and we'll check the name
okay the p is capital four
python
and after that we have client dot run
that set
so we'll save this and first we'll kill
our terminal
and click on the Run button
so you can see that we have logged in as
project
and now we'll move back to our board so
our board is active and we'll start with
the high command
so it says hello and if we write High
board
then also it says hello that is if our
message contains high then the board
will be respond with hello and if we ask
him the image
he'll respondus with the image and if we
ask him with the video
it takes time like there's the video is
a bit larger in size
okay
so it doesn't have any attribute video
that is python node and before we quote
an error here
MP4
just check
yeah
this is the same file
and I should not have been occurred
okay
we have asked for the video
okay there it is
we have written start with it starts
with
that's why I responded for image but not
for video
audio and the file
now let's save this and first of all
kill the terminal and run the code again
we can see the session ID and it has
logged in
now we'll move back to our project and
now we'll ask the board for video
now we'll see what it responds
yeah you can see that it has responded
with the video you can also play it here
and if we ask for
image
and gives us the Divine image
and if we ask for the audio
it has shared the audio that is
beautiful underscore mistakes and we ask
for the file
please
so I think we got
any error
that is going to start with file
and we have python root PDF and the
error is payroll too large okay the
request entity is too large
so we have not subscribed with the Nitro
version so we can just send the 8mb
files we will just
check what is the size
okay it's of 9 MB so it won't shift
so you can place any file that is less
than 8 MB your board would respond for
that
and
with that we are done with the boat and
we are ready we are with the boat first
we'll see the demo of our tutorial that
is the Discord music board but we are
gonna create
so this is a source code
so we'll just run it and first we'll get
a terminal
and I will run it for you guys
so it has been successfully executed
now we'll move to Discord and
this code is basically for the simple
and server I am in the same plan server
and now
we will visit a voice Channel
and
what we have in this code is
that is to play the song we will use
play underscore song
and to get the board joined we'll use
join
and in starting we'll use exclamation
marks for the commands that is command
prefix
so we'll move here
you can see that the simple and board is
live here
we'll just write a command
to make it join this channel
you can see here the simply on board has
joined the channel
now we'll ask him to play any song so
we'll
get something from YouTube
so we will move to YouTube
and just copy this link
and move back to our Discord and here we
will write the command
play underscore song
that is what we have set it and we'll
paste the link here and press enter
so
we have given the command to assimplant
board and you can see that the simply on
board is typing first it will download
the music then it will play for us
so we have to wait some seconds
till it does all its work
it's taking time
okay we got another haircut now
unable to recognize the tab page
okay
so we will give another link
to our bot
for that we'll go to
YouTube
and okay
with this
link
to a boat
now that's important okay
it has played I hope
you are able to hear that sound
no one will get it
okay now we have seen the demonstration
of our project now we'll move
to create our own music port so for that
first
we will
create a folder
not in this
we'll create in Python projects
and
name it as
Discord music port
and inside this port we'll open the
command prompt
yeah and now we are open our ID
that is we will use the visual studio
code you can use any ID that you have
hands on I usually use the visual studio
code and here we will create a file and
name it as main.py
and now the first thing we have to do is
set up the application of our Discord
board and import the libraries but
before that let's have a small
discussion about the Discord
that Discord is a voice and text
communication platform for gamers and
player streamers and developers use the
score to discuss games answer questions
chat while they play and much more it
even has a game store complete with
critical reviews and a subscription
service it is nearly a One-Stop solution
for gaming communities
now
we'll move to create a Discord board and
for that you should have an account on
this code by visiting the website you
can create a account or
you can have an app in your mobile phone
so moving on we will move to Discord
and create a new server
for our project
for me and my friends
and I will name the server as
music
board
okay
now I'll click on create
now I have created the server
and these are the channels General
Channel and the voice Channel that's
also has the name General Channel
now we'll go to the Discord development
website
so for that
will visit the browser
and search for
Discord developer portal
and here
first you have to move to the
applications
and first you have to sign in here after
signing in then you have to move to the
applications
you can use any previous applications
you have made or just click on the new
application and give it a name to
application and we'll name it as
but we have named to the server
that was music board
so we'll name the application
as music board
will
take the terms and conditions and click
on create
now
you could see the name that is music
port now if you want to give tags you
can give the tag that is chat
or chat board
and it's asking to save the changes
we'll save the changes
and now we'll move to the board now
to create a board here we'll click on
the add board
and then click on yes to it too many
users have this username please try
another
okay
so you just name the
both as music
port
o simply
okay
and we'll save the changes
now we'll move to the board and click on
ADD bot and then yes to it
now you could see that the username that
is music board Pro simply
and now moving more
oh
now we have added the board
now we'll just
go downwards and
click on Port permission set
administrator
so a board would have all the
permissions
now we'll visit the authorization too
and select
in-app authorization
and for the Scopes we'll select board
and for both permissions we'll select
the administrator
and it's asked to
save the changes we have saved the
changes now we'll move to the URL
generator
and here in Scopes we'll click on the
board and for the board permissions
we'll click on the administrator
and this is the link
which you have to copy
and open in your browser
and copy paste it and you have to store
this link
so for that
I will open a dock
file and in that I will store it so our
server name is music board that we have
created in the Discord a simple Discord
node on the Discord developer portal
that we created on the Discord
now we'll continue and you can see that
it is asking that we have given in the
administrator permissions yes authorize
it so it's asking
for a captcha
if I am a human or not
you can see that
there was a notification that the board
is authorized and it has been popped
into the channel
into the server
so we will just create a new Doc file
and
paste our link here okay
don't worry I will change these links
reset them so
you guys can't misuse them okay
so I will just change them okay
and now
we'll get the token for board but before
getting the token we will give the
permissions that is requires
authorization to Grant
presence intent
server number intent
and message content okay
now we'll reset the token
and this is my token I will copy it
and I will paste it here
and I'm gonna change it I'm gonna reset
it after the project is completed so
don't worry if anyone
is
thinking to use my token okay
so
here we have set the Discord application
and the Discord developer portal now
we'll move to install some libraries
so we'll move back to our main.py and
search our command prompt
foreign
prompt
okay
yeah this one
okay so here we will install some
packages
first we'll start with pi NaCl
so you can just
visit the browser and type Pi NaCl pipef
you can see the official website you
have to just copy the command
go to a command prompt
paste it and press enter
and the module would be installed for
you as you can see that it states that
the requirement is already satisfied as
I have already installed these modules
so one by one I will show you which
modules we have to install now this is
essential
so we will just go back to our Command
Prompt paste the command press enter
and I think it's
I have already installed it but yeah it
has installed again no it shows
now the next module we have to install
is the Discord module so we just have to
copy the command paste it in the command
prompt or The Terminal of your ID
it states that the requirement is
already satisfied we'll move to Discord
EXT bot external bot and we'll paste the
command here and press enter
then we'll move to python dot
environment
and you can see its requirement is
already satisfied and now we'll paste
this command it's
requirement is already satisfied
as I've already installed all the
packages if you face any issue in
installing these packages just comment
down in the comment section and our
experts will be
helping you with all your queries okay
and note environment
the requirement is already satisfied now
the last one okay we have notified on
YouTube
so I will also to install the YouTube
One
it says the states that the requirement
is already satisfied okay
now
the OS one
so we'll just copy the command here
I have already installed I don't know
why it's installing again
okay uh okay I got it all right it's
installing okay so we will let it being
downloaded and install it
till then we will import all the
packages okay
so we'll start with import
sends you
will
import
Discord
and
we will import
from discover.ext
will import
commands and
external class okay
so commands and
we will import tasks
okay
now we'll import
OS
and
from
dot environment
port
load underscore
dot environment
okay
now we'll import
YouTube underscore DL
okay
okay
uh this we don't need also
you know all the other caches have been
installed okay no issues we don't need
this also
so we also need to install FM pack I
will
tell you
for what will need that
I will mention all these commands in the
comment section and we have to set the
environment variables for this FM pack
we will also come to that
or first we
should come to that only no we'll start
with the code and after that we'll
install the FM Bank okay I've already
installed on my system I will show you
how you guys can install it okay
so moving on
we have imported all the libraries and
the module that is YouTube underscore DL
it's an open source Download Manager for
video and audio content from YouTube and
other video hosting websites so what
we'll do in this project is first we'll
download the video
what we are sending to a port it will
download it and then it will play okay
now we need to set intents for a boat
intense allow a board to subscribe to
specific buckets of events allowing
developers to choose which events the
port listens to and to which it doesn't
for example sometimes you go on the boat
to Listen to Only messages and nothing
else
so we'll set the intents for that okay
so moving on
to set the intents we'll create a
variable intents and inside
from the Discord library or the Discord
module we'll use Discord Dot
intents
dot all
and we'll create another variable that
is client equal to
this code
Dot
client
and inside will set
intents equal to
intents okay
now
we'll set commands
uh we'll set it for both only that word
prefix we should set for our board so
that our board could understand those
commands Okay
so command store board and inside will
set the command prefix
so for that we'll write command prefix
you can see here that Visual Studio code
already suggests us the functions over
the commands Okay
so it has suggested command prefix and
inside the inverted commas we'll set
exclamation mark okay
and we'll set intents equal to intents
okay oh it shows yeah
okay oh sorry
we have two
turn this into a variable
and
we don't have to close the bracket there
I don't know why I have closed that
and now here
we will
paste our Discord token and load the
environment variable okay
so for that we'll write the command load
underscore
dot EnV
and now here
we will store our Discord token
that is equal to OS Dot
get EnV
and inside we will paste our disco token
we'll just paste it no and open the
command
so we have to visit our browser and I'll
document this was my token I will copy
it and move back and paste it here okay
and I have to show you guys that our
board is here but it's offline we will
make it online and then we'll ask him
the commands Okay
so moving on now we'll write the code to
download the video
for that we'll use the YouTube
underscore DL module okay
so our next step is dealing with the
part that actually downloads the audio
file from the video link we provide
please note that this board is just a
demonstration it's not illegal to
download from YouTube or personal used
according to
any laws or something but it might be
against the YouTube terms of service so
please be sensible and use this for
personal use only okay
like it might be against the YouTube
terms and conditions that is terms of
service
so to download it we will start with the
commands that is YouTube
underscore DL
go to details
dot bug underscore
reports underscore
message
and we'll use the Lambda function here
okay
so we'll use the Lambda function here
and after the colon we'll just
have the inverted Commerce now we will
declare the format options that this
module contains
so for that we'll write the command
ytdl underscore
format underscore options
and that is equal to
inside the curly braces we will Define
all the format options
so we'll start with
format
colon
and inside the invite commas only
we will write best audio
slash best
and the restricted
file names that is restrict file names
okay
you could just copy the commands or like
we have another video where we have
McDonald's
so we'll just get these commands copied
now once
more
like we don't have to understand
anything in this so why to waste the
time we'll code as fast as we can
so we'll just copy these commands and
now we'll write the FM pack options
so we have installed the FM pack library
and how to download the extraction
module
and how to set the environment variables
will come on that but before that we
will set the FM pack options
so for that we'll create a variable if
I'm pack underscore options
and that is
inside the curly braces we'll set
options
minus VN
okay
now
we will create a variable that is ytdl
and inside we'll use the YouTube
underscore DL module
and its function that is YouTube DL
YouTube DL and inside will pass
ytdl format options that we have
set above okay inside will pass these
so for that we'll just write
ytdr format options
okay now we will create a class
okay we just
go to bracket here
we'll just get it there and now we'll
create a class
and inside we will set the URL variable
that will take the URL which will pass
to the board and that URL video will be
downloaded and then that will be played
by the port as an audio
okay so for that we'll start with a
class and name it as
YT DL
source
and inside we will pass this code
dot that is from the Discord
and we can use the version oh we don't
we have to use the pscm volume
Transformer and it's not showing here so
we'll just write down that is PCM
volume Transformer okay
and after that we will
find the init function
that is underscore underscore
in it
and inside will pass self
and source
um strict
data
and we'll set the volume
equal to 0.5
okay
now you set the volume
now super dot init
and inside will pass the source and
volume
source
and volume
so we have passed it here now we'll
declare other things that is data title
and the URL
so for that we'll just write
self.data
net is equal to
data and then
we'll
self Dot
title
that is equal to
data Dot get
title
now
for the URL
will set self dot URL and
that will set
just the inverted commas so that it
could
take the URL what will give to the board
okay
now we'll create a method that would be
the class method okay for that we'll use
add the rate
class method and inside
okay uh
nothing just ignore that
so we will use a sync and
we will create a function and name it as
from URL
so we'll create a function from URL and
inside we will pass
CLS
URL
asterisk
and loop
so that it doesn't
play it again and again so we'll set the
loop equal to none
okay and
we'll set
stream equal to false so it shouldn't
stream it from the internet first it
should download and then it should be
played by the following commands we'll
set it okay
so we set the stream equal to false
now we'll set Loop
that is equal to
Loop
or
will use the module async here and
we'll get event Loop
function
um
okay
and now we'll set the data
equal to
a weight
Loop dot run
Loop dot run
underscore
in executor we'll use this function
that is run in executor and inside we
will pass
none
and we will have a Lambda function here
and inside this Lambda function
we will use ytdl that is a YouTube and
use the extract info function
extract the information
from the URL we have provided
and inside will pass the URL
and
we will write
download
equal to
node stream that is we don't have to
stream it
okay
so
we have set the data
now
we will
run a if statement that is if
entries
in data
that is we'll take the first item from a
playlist if you have
given the link or URL for a playlist
we'll take the
first item from that playlist okay put
that will write
data equal to
inside data
entries
and
hmm
in the first entry
okay
we'll take that and now
here
let's set the file name
the file that we will download
that would be
data
and inside
title
okay
no
if
so we'll set up here only that is
if stream
else
yd DL Dot
prepare underscore
file name and inside we will pass data
okay
here we have passed the data and here we
will return
the file name
okay
now we have created the from URL method
that is the method of ytdl source class
that takes in the URL as a parameter and
Returns the file name of the audio file
which gets downloaded
now we'll add board commands
so now let's add the join function so
we'll write the join command that would
start with the exclamation mark that we
have set the commands prefix
so to join the board in a particular
channel that is a voice Channel we'll
write the command and we'll declare a
method for that to tell the board to
join the voice Channel and we will
declare a leave method to tell the board
to disconnect then we will
and declare other methods that would be
for play pose resume and stop
so starting with we will start with the
join method okay
for that
we'll start
okay
so
for the
join method we'll start with at the rate
board dot command
will use the board variable that we have
declared earlier
and inside
we will name this method as join
okay
and
if you want you can just write a help
also that is it will tell the board to
join the voice Channel okay
but we will go on and use the function
that is
async
left and we'll create a function join
and inside this we'll pass
CTX
and
here we'll use if command that is
if not
CTX
dots
uh will message the author
voice that would be a voice would pop
out when the
when I'm bored will join the channel
okay
so note CTX Dot
now if like here if it doesn't join then
you will get the message okay
Dot message and
dot author
note
in voice
now we'll use a weight
and inside we'll write the message that
will get if it doesn't show in the
channel That is await CTX Dot
send
and inside
curly braces
and we'll get the message that it is not
connected to a voice Channel okay
it will take the name of the board
that is the author.name that I'll just
show you okay
S Note
connected to a
voice
Channel
okay
got it
now
we'll use
format
and inside
pass CTX Dot
message
dot author
dot name
what name
it should appear
in the curly braces okay
now
well
it return
okay
now we will declare our else statement
that would be
if it joins the channel
then Channel equal to
what message it should display
or it should just connect to the channel
okay we won't display any message here
we just wanted to join the channel
so for that we'll write CTX
Dot message
Dot
author
dot OS root
Channel
okay
now we'll use a weight
so it could
connect to the channel and we'll write
the command for that channel dot connect
okay
so we have written
the function
to get a bot join into a channel
now
we'll write a command to play the song
so for that all right add the rate go
Dot command
and inside we will name it
and we name it as
play so
play underscore
so
and if you want to write help to
get like what this command does so you
could just
pass a Helper and inside that you could
just store a line that
describes what this command does okay
and here we'll create a function
and name it as play and inside pass X
comma URL
no
we will create a variable and named as
server
and inside
will pass CTX Dot
message Dot Guild
and now we'll
create a variable that is voice
underscore
Channel
and that is equal to
server
Dot
voice underscore
client
and now
now
right
sorry
async
with
CTX
Dot
typing
that is when we'll call this function so
a board will show us typing
that what we have named our Port that is
music port so it's typing music board
simply something we have named it
and what it would type it that would be
create a variable file name
and inside
all right
wait
ytdl
source
and
from URL function
will take the URL
pass the URL into it and loop equal to
board dot Loop okay
now
we will
set up
like we'll take the voice Channel
and
use the function
play
and inside
you will use
disco dot fm pack audio okay
FM pack
a PC module and that function
starts with your f
m
Bank
PCM
audio
okay
and inside
will pass executable
and here we will set the path we will
set the FM Peg we will download it and
set the environment variable and we will
extract these files of FM pack so here
we will write the path to that
so we'll write this path
after we will complete the code we'll
see how to download it and how to
extract the FM pack okay
so here
we will write the executable and now
will also pass source
that is equal to
file name
okay
this is equal to phylum now
we'll use a weight
a weight and inside CTX Dot
send
and inside we'll write
in bold letters
so for that we'll use the asterisk two
times
that would be
now playing
colon
and asterisk
and here we will
the curly braces
and use the format
and inside will pass
file name okay
now here first we check if the user who
wants to play music has already joined
the voice Channel or not if not will
tell the user to join first okay
now
we'll create command for pose
so for that right add the rate
code dot command
and inside
will set name equal to pose
okay
name equal to
pose
and if you want to set help you could
also set the help but we don't need we
know what we are going to do with this
function so
we'll write async Dev
and we will write the function name
that will name as pause and set will
pass CTX
signed pass
voice underscore client
and that is equal to CTX Dot
send message now we want
to send message it will CTX Dot
message
Dot
Guild
and we'll use the voice client
okay
now
if
voice
client
is playing
then we will pause it if we use this
command post that would be exclamation
pose
so uh
we are getting a if statement inside if
voice
client
Dot
is playing
then we'll use a weight
that is voice underscore
client
and we will pause it okay
and now else
we'll use the await
that is
CTX Dot
send
so if it's already post we will
send some message that would be
the board is
the boat has post the music
or it's not
playing anything okay
so
we'll pass this
and this is for the pores now we will
declare a function for resume
so for that we'll write at the rate
board dot command
and inside you will pass name
and we'll pass the name that would be
equal to zoom
and if we want to set help you could set
the help hence there's no need so here
we will set the function and name it as
resume and inside will pass CTX okay
now
we'll use
The Voice client
and here
write a message Dot
Guild Dot
OS underscore client
so we have set the voice client here
okay
now if voice client is post then we'll
resume it okay so for that we'll write
the command if
voice underscore
client dot is underscore
post
then we'll use the await function
let us await
voice underscore
client Dot
will resume it okay
we will resume it
else
if it's already playing then we'll just
pass the message
in the weight that is
ctx.send
and inside will pass the message
that
we can pass
if we have used the initial method and
it doesn't play any song
then we'll pass the messages that
the boat is not playing any song
that's why I had assume command won't
work
okay
now we will
write a command
for leave that is we have asked about to
join
a channel that is the version and if you
want him to leave it so for that we'll
write the command at the rate go dot
command and inside we'll set the name
as leave okay
okay now if you want to set help you can
set it else new just
write the function async Def
and name the function as
leave and inside will pass CTX
and after that we'll set the voice
client
OS underscore client
and that is equal to CTX Dot
here we will again set the
message.gill.voice client okay
okay now
we'll use the if statement that is if
the voice client is connected then we'll
disconnect it that is we'll ask him to
leave the channel
so for that we'll write the command
if voice
underscore client
is connected
then we lose a weight
that is voice underscore
client
and we will disconnect it so we'll use
load this
connect
okay
or else
if the board is not connected to voice
channel will just
get the message
so for that
we'll just write
client
not will not write voice.client we'll
use the update function
to get the message that would be a wait
CTX Dot
send and we will get the messages
that the
board is
board has
not joined
a question
okay
now
uh we are left with
the
resume always okay we have not written
the stop
command for the Stop command or the stop
function so we will write for that
so for that we'll just
create add the rate board Dot command
and inside will set the name as
stop okay
and in the next we will create a
function that is async Def and name it
as stop and inside will pass CTX
okay now we'll create the voice connect
so voice client equal to CTX Dot
message dot Guild
Dot
voice underscore
client
okay
now if
voice client is playing
that is
if voice underscore
client
is playing
then
we can just write the command to stop it
so for that we'll use the await
and
we'll write Vice underscore client
dot stop
okay
now else
um
now if it's the body is not playing
anything at that moment we will just
pass the message there that is await CTX
Dot
send
and inside
will pass the message that is
the port is
note
playing
any
thing
okay
now
we will just
get a code running
or we'll just move to the last part of a
code that is to deploy the board locally
we will activate the virtual environment
and run the this file
so for that
let me just write the last month that
will be the main functions that is
underscore underscore name
we could add more commands also first
we'll run this and after that we'll see
if
we need something else
or we are done with it
and here
write board dot run
and r
Discord token
so we'll just place the Discord token
here and that we have
inert
browser I will just
so we'll just
leave it here copy our token
go back
and paste it here
something happened
no
it's okay
now we have to paste the path for FM
pack so
okay
so we will just visit the browser and I
will provide you the link to download
the FM pack
just
click on Windows
and then Windows built by
ptbn
no not this
you will go to download the source code
please download it but
yeah you can do it Dave
and here we will download the FM pack
get full load 700. so this is what we
need you just
cancel it
okay
so we will
get to the downloads
and it's being downloaded
so it could download it
so we'll just extract the files
and we'll extract in the same folder
so that is in the C
and in C we have python projects and
python projects where I have this code
music port
okay
so we will get all the files extracted
there
okay see
simply not simply not no we have to go
to python projects and we have to go
music board then we have FM pack and in
bin we have
seasonal three so we'll just
copy this
path
and paste it
in our
execute table okay
now we'll
clear the terminal
and get done with the project
and now we have to set the environment
variable for FM pack
so we'll just search
that is
environment edit the system environment
variables and just click enter and this
will appear
so you just have to click the
environment variables
and click on edit
when it uh you have to click on new
wheat
you just see the path and click on edit
and
click on path and then edit
and here we will
put a new variable
and where we have stored all this we'll
just copy the
path
and
paste it here
and click ok
and now we'll move back to
our
code
now we'll save the file
and run the file
so it's showing that the shared ID
is connected to Gateway so we'll move to
yeah you can see that the music board
Pro simply
it's been online
now I will run and execute the file
so we can see that it states that
it has connected to the Gateway
now we'll move to this code
and that was it has hopped into the
server now we can see that it is online
and now we have joined the voice Channel
and now we want a boat to join the
version for that we'll write the command
join
and you can see that our board has also
joined the question
now we want to play
any
audio file
hmm
no move to YouTube
and from the same plan videos only
choose one
that is a small one
so because first it will download it
and then it will play it so
it will take time to get a download
so we'll move to Discord
and
write the command
play underscore song Space
the link of the video and press enter
now you can see now almost that music
board Pro simply is typing
then it's executing the commands and is
downloading the file and will play
you can see that it has started
ring now we'll stop it
now we want to resume it
no we would be able to resume as we have
stopped it if we have posted then we can
resume it so here are
Discord music port is ready and it's
good to go
so you can just say it how we have
created it
and I will provide you the source code
files and the FM pack URL from where you
can download it and set it as
environment variable so I hope the
session was interesting and informative
