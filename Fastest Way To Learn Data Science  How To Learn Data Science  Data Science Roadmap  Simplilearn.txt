hey everyone welcome back to Simply
learns YouTube channel if you're excited
about diving into the world of data but
aren't sure where to start you are in
the right place with more data being
generated every day companies are eager
to hire skilled professionals who can
turn this raw data into actionable
insights it's like having a superpower
in today's world of information overload
so in today's video we are breaking down
a fast track road map to learn data
science in Just 2 months there are
various roles within this field like
data analysts who focus on interpreting
data data Engineers who build and
maintain data pipelines and machine
learning Engineers who develop
algorithms to make predictions the
demand for these roles is kid oting but
why because every industry is becoming
more datadriven and businesses need
experts to make sense of all that
information so grab your notebooks and
let's Jump Right In so first let's
understand what data science
data science is all about extracting
insights from data using techniques from
statistics programming and machine
learning let's understand this with a
simple case study so imagine an
e-commerce company wants to improve its
sales by analyzing customer data a data
scientist can identify purchasing
patterns such as which products are
often brought together this Insight can
lead to strategic decisions like
bundling products or personalizing
marketing campaigns ultimately boosting
sales so to start with let's quickly see
what a data scientist life cycle looks
like the data scientist life cycle is a
structured process that involves several
key phases it starts with problem
identification where the data scientist
defines the problem or question to be
addressed next is data collection where
relevant data is gathered from various
sources then comes data cleaning data
cleaning follows where raw data is
processed to remove inaccuracies and
inconsistencies in the exploratory data
analysis phase in initial patterns and
insights are discovered this leads to
model building where algorithms are
applied to predict outcomes or classify
data so the cycle continues with model
evaluation where the performance of the
model is tested and refined and finally
deployment and monitoring are carried
out where the model is put into
production and its performance is
continuously monitored to ensure it
remains accurate and effective so now
let's talk about the essential skills
you'll need to get started in data
science number one programming languages
you will need to learn python or R
python is widely used because it's easy
to learn and has many useful libraries
for data science R is also great
especially for statistical analysis then
comes tools and Technologies tools like
Jupiter notebooks make coding easier and
more interactive SQL is important for
working with databases allowing you to
retrieve and manage data for creating
visuals libraries like matplotlib and
cabor help you turn data into graphs and
charts then comes mathematics and
statistics you don't need to be a math
expert but it's helpful to understand
the basics of Statistics probability and
some linear algebra data manipulation
and cleaning this is a big part of data
scientist job you'll often spend time
cleaning up data to make sure it's
accurate and ready for analysis python
Panda's library is perfect for sorting
filtering and transforming data and
finally learning about machine learning
algorithms is crucial this is where you
use data to make predictions and
decisions which is a key part of data
science so how do you learn all this so
that you can quickly reach your goal
next up we are diving into an exciting
two-month plan to Kickstart your journey
to become a data scientist so without
any further Ado let's get started so in
week one start with python a must know
programming language for any aspiring
data scientist you'll begin by
familiarizing yourself with python
syntax essentially how to write code and
understanding different data types like
numbers and strings you should also
learn about variables which act as
containers for storing data next you can
explore how to use operators and control
flow tools these include Loops which are
useful for repeating tasks and
conditionals like IFL statements that
make your code more Dynamic and
responsive as you become comfortable you
should move on to intermediate topics
such as lists for storing multiple items
dictionaries for storing data in key
value Pairs and file handling for
reading and writing files these skills
are essential for efficiently managing
and manipulating data now week two
consists of mathematics and statistics
in week two focus on math side of data
science start with basic algebra
Concepts and then move on to linear
algebra which is crucial for
understanding data relationships and
Transformations you should also learn
about statistics a vital tool in data
science this includes understanding
descriptive statistics which help
summarize data and probability
distributions which provide insights
into Data patterns and likelihoods in
week three you can go with data
manipulation and cleaning focus on data
manipulation and cleaning you can use
pandas a powerful python library to
handle data frames merge data sets and
perform basic data Transformations
pandas is your go-to tool for making
data analysis straightforward and
efficient you should also learn data
cleaning techniques such as handling
missing values like deciding how to deal
with blanks in your data and detecting
outliers clean data is essential for
accurate analysis and reliable results
now it's time to talk about databases
you can learn SQL the language used for
managing and quering database
start with basic commands like select
for choosing data Ved for filtering data
and order by for sorting data so simply
learn tutorials can be a great resource
to guide you through these foundational
steps and as you progress you should
delve into more advanced topics like
joints for combining data from different
tables and aggregations for summarizing
data so these skills are crucial for
handling complex queries and gaining
deeper insights from your data now
moving on to month two begin the second
month by mastering data visualization
you can learn to create simple charts
like bar graphs line charts and Scatter
Plots using ma plot lip a widely used
visualization Library these visuals are
essential for communicating your data
findings clearly and effectively so once
you're comfortable with the basics you
should explore plotly for creating
interactive and more complex
visualizations this skill will enable
you to present data in an engaging and
dynamic way making your analysis more
impactful so you can start by
understanding the basics of machine
learning including supervised learning
where the computer learns from labeled
data and unsupervised learning where the
computer finds patterns in data on its
own these are foundational Concepts that
will open up many possibilities in data
science you should get familiar with key
algorithms like linear regression used
for predicting values and key means
clustering used for grouping similar
data points these algorithms are the
building blocks of machine learning and
are widely used in various applications
now in this week take your machine
learning skills to the next level you
can learn about more advanced algorithms
like decision trees great for both
classification and regression tasks then
comes random forests which improve
accuracy through assemble learning and
support Vector machines used for
classification tasks these tools will
help you build more sophisticated and
accurate models and as you up toward the
end of your Learning Journey it's time
to put your skills to the test you
should work on real world data sets
practice building and deploying machine
learning models and create data
visualization dashboards these projects
are cre crucial for reinforcing what you
have learned and gaining practical
experience finally complete a Capstone
