AI will pretty much touch everything we
do it's more likely to be correct and
grounded in reality talk to the AI about
how to do better it's a very deep
philosophical conversation it's a bit
above my f grade I'm going to say
something and it it's it's going to
sound completely
opposite um of what people feel uh you
you you probably recall uh over the
course of the last 10 years 15 years um
almost everybody
who sits on a stage like this would tell
you it is vital that your children learn
computer
science um everybody should learn how to
program and in fact it's almost exactly
the opposite it is our job to create
Computing technology such that nobody
has to
program and that the programming
language is
human everybody in the world is now a
programmer this is the miracle
artificial intelligence or AI from its
humble beginnings in 1950s AI has
evolved from the simple problem solving
and symbolic reasoning to the advanced
machine learning and deep learning
techniques that power some of the most
Innovative application we see today so
AI is not just a bus word it is a
revolutionary Force reshaping Industries
enhancing daily life and creating
unmatch opportunities across various
sector AI is changing numerous fields in
healthare it aids in early disease
diagnosis and personalized treatment
plans in finance it transform money
management with the robo advisers and
fraud detection system the automotive
industry is seeing the rise of
autonomous vehicles that navigate
traffic and recognize obstacle while
retail and e-commerce benefit from
personalized shopping experience and
optimize Supply Chain management so one
of the most exciting developments in the
AI is the rise of Advanced CI tools like
chbd 40 Google Gemini and generative AI
models so these tools represent The
Pinacle of conversational AI capable of
understanding and generating humanik
text with remarkable accuracy CH gbt 40
can assist in writing brainstorming
ideas and even tutoring make its
valuable resource for student
professional and creatives similarly
Google Gemini take AI integration to the
next level enhancing search capabilities
providing insightful responses and
inating seamlessly into our digital
lives generative AI is a subset of AI is
also making views by creating new
content from scratch tools like Dal
which generates images from textual
reception and gpt3 which can write
coherent and creative texts are just the
beginnings so these Technologies are
changing Fields like art design and
content creation enabling the generation
of unique and personal outputs that were
previously unimaginable so beyond
specific Industries AI application
extend to everyday's life voice
activated assistant like Siri and Alexa
and smart home devices learn our
preferences and adjust our environments
accordingly so AI is embedded in the
technology we use daily making our lives
more convenient connected and efficient
so join us as we explore the future of
AI examining the breakthroughs the
challenges and the endless possibilities
that lies ahead so whether you are a
tech Enthusiast a professional in the
field or simply curious about wor next
so this video will provide you with a
comprehensive look at how AI is shaping
our world and what we can expert in the
years to come so before we move forward
as we know chb Gemini generi TOS is an
AI based and if you want to learn how
this school AI develop and want to
create your own craving a career upgrade

whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back so try simply as post graduate
programs in Ai and machine learning from
party University in collaboration with
IBM so this core teaches in demand
skills such as machine learning deep
learning NLP computer vision reinforce
learning generative AI prompt
engineering CH GT and many more so don't
forget to check out the course link from
the description box below and the pin
command so without any further Ado let's
get started so how AI will impact the
future the first is enhanced business
automation AI is transforming business
automation with 55% of organization
adopting AI technology chat Bots and
digital assistant handle customer
interaction and basic employee inquiries
speeding up decision making the second
thing is job disruption automation May
displace job with one3 to takes
potentially automated while roles like
Securities are at risk demand for
machine learning specialist is rising AI
is more likely to augment skilled and
creative position emphasizing the need
for Skilling data privacy issues
training AI model requires large data
set raising privacy concern the FTC is
investiga in open AI for potential
violation and the Biden Harris
Administration introduced an AI bill of
right to promote data
transpan the fourth one is increased
regulation AI impact on intellectual
property and ethical concerns is leading
to increased regulation lawsuits and
government guidelines on responsible AI
use could reshape the industry climate
change concern AI optimize Supply chains
and reduce emission but the energy
needed for the AI models may increase
carbon emission potentially negating
environmental benefits so understanding
these impacts help us to prepare for
ai's future challenges and opportunities
so now let's see what industries will AI
impact the most the first one is
manufacturing AI enhances manufacturing
with robotic arm and predictive sensors
improving tasks like assembly and
equipment and maintenance the second is
Healthcare AI changes healthare by
quickly identifying diseases stream Ling
drug Discovery and monitoring patients
through virtual nursing assistant The
Third One Finance AI helps bank and
financial institution detect fraud
conduct Audits and assess loan
applications while Trader use AI for
risk assessment and smart investment
decision the fourth one education AI
personalizes education by digitizing
textbook deducting plagarism and
analyzing student emotions to tailor
learning experience the fifth one
customer service AI power head Bots and
virtual assistant provide data D
insights enhancing customer services
interaction so these industries are
experiencing significant changes due to
AI driving Innovation and efficiency
across various sector so now let's move
forward and see some risk and dangers of
AI so AI offers many benefits but also
possess significant risk the first one
job loss from 2023 to 2028 44% of worker
skills will be disrupted without
upskilling AI could lead to higher
unemployment and fewer opportunities for
marginalized groups the second one is
human biases AI often reflects the
biases of its trainer such as facial
recognition favoring lighter skin tones
unchecked biases can perpetuate social
inequalities the third one defects and
misinformation defects plus reality
spreading misinformation with dangerous
consequences they can be used for
political propaganda financial fraud and
compromising reputation the fourth one
data privacy AI training on public data
risk breaches that expose a personal
information a 2024 Cisco survey found
48% of businesses use non-public
information in AI tools with 69
concerned about intellectual property
and legal rights breaches could expose
million of consumers data the fifth one
automated weapons AI in automated weapon
fails to distinguish between Soldier and
civilan posing savior threats misuse
would lead endangered large population
understanding these risk is crucial for
responsible AI development and the use
so as we explore the future of AI it's
clear that impact will be profound and
far-reaching AI will change Industries
enhance efficiency and drive Innovation
however it also brings significant
challenges including job displacement
biases privacy concern misinformation
and the ethical implication of automated
weapons so to harness AI potential
responsibility we must invest in
upscaling our Workforce address biases
in AI system protect data privacy and
develop regulations that ensure ethical
AI use so thank you for joining us on
