Microsoft PBI certification training now
without further delay let's get started
now let us imagine that you work with a
banking organization which is a really
Elite or Superior one and you want to
give loans to your customers and apart
from having that credit score of 95 and
above you don't want to take any risk
with your C customer so you want to make
sure that your customers have a good
credit score of 105 or above and if
anyone is not matching that criteria and
you're not contacting them you're not
giving them loan right now let's say we
have the list of customers here and you
just click on the customer name and you
get the credit score of the customer the
average DTI average credit score weight
average credit utility score and average
employment weight right and you can also
see how their credit score is
fluctuating is it growing or is it
dropping in one single dashboard and it
is also visually aesthetic now how to
create such beautiful dashboards in real
time using PP so that's exactly what we
going to do here and before we get
started with actually creating this
particular dashboard let's understand
the banking terms what is DTI what is
credit score what is average utility
what is employment weight and everything
and after that let's create create a
perfect template a beautiful template
like the background what we have right
now here and after that let's create our
own data set so this particular data set
is not related to any of the official
banking sectors this is a virtually
created completely different data set
which is not related to any banks in
real time right so let's also create our
own data set using chat GPT 4 and let's
also create our sample data set using
chat GPT 4.0 and then get started with
building our dashboard now that's it
let's quickly go back to PPD so now
let's begin with the agenda for today's
session how do banks lend the loan and
after that we will check into how to
prepare data and template and followed
by that we will build the final
dashboard now let's get started with how
to Banks lend the loan so if you want to
take a loan from any bank they take care
of four different parameters utility DTI
two years job and credit score let's
understand all these four so the first
parameter is utility now let's say you
have a credit card and your credit card
Bank limit is
$10,000 and you're supposed to use only
30% of that particular credit card which
means if you are under $3,000 which if
you're using $3,000 or less then your
utility is 25% so this particular
criteria will carry 25% of the FED right
remember the four parameters so all
these four parameters are based on your
uh utilization right so if you uh are in
the parameter given let's say your
utility is less than $33,000 per month
based on your I mean 30% of your credit
card balance then you will gain the
credit score weight of 25% from here if
you are um you know spending more than
that let's say your limit is for uh
10,000 and you're spending 4,000 then
this particular weight will drop but if
you're just spending ,000 or anything
less than 25 or 30% of your credit card
then you'll get the entire full weight
of 25% and not more than that but if you
are spending more than the provided
utility limit then your weight might go
down from 25 to 23 22 and around that
right now the next U requirement or the
parameter is DTI so this is based on
your uh monthly income right so how much
uh income you're getting cross monthly
income and it will be divided by uh the
total monthly emis so the rent the bike
emis car emis everything sum of that
divided by your gross monthly income
into 100 so this again carries 25% of
your weight and the next third parameter
is two years of job so to get a loan you
should have minimum of two years of job
right and if you're having anything
above uh two years like three years or
anything then you'll get full weight of
20% and if you are having less uh
experience or less job like maybe uh 1.5
years of uh job period less which is
compared to the uh compared to the
actual requirement it is less right so
in that scenario your weight might go a
little too down right maybe around 15%
or 18% and lastly you will have the
credit score so many people call it
civil score or credit score this is also
uh based on your credit score and
threshold so your threshold should be uh
750 which is not changeable and your
crate score is something which is
variable right it can be 600 it can be
anything so the threshold if you're
getting anything above 750 then that's a
good good sub score or credit score so
here you will find if you have a good
credit score then you will again have
30% of the weight and if you're having a
bad civil score then the weight might go
down to 25 29 based on the result you're
getting so these are the formulas for it
so ultimately summing up all the weights
utility weight DTI weight minimum two
years job requirement weit and the
credit score weight it should be equal
to 100% so mostly the banks give away
loans if you have anything above 90 or
95% so in our situation we are focusing
a little more so we are targeting 105%
if you're getting 105% weight only then
uh the bank will be giving your a loan
to be on the safest side so that your
loan amount for will be fully recovered
so this is how the banks lend loan now
for this requirement we will will be
creating a dashboard now firstly let's
start by creating a perfect template for
our dashboard so let's quickly jump to a
PowerPoint window and create a blank
PowerPoint and here let's try to add in
some shapes to
your
template and take care of the rounded
Corners if you want to have custom uh uh
size for this you can also do that so
let's go with 30
and
17.5 that should be fine you can also
take care of orders if you want to
increase or decrease now shape F you can
choose any of the colors I'll go
with uh slighter shade of
gray 45
47 this could be fine and I don't want
any of the
visual outlines no
outline and maybe you can add some shape
fex as well so go to shadow that
shadow and if you really want to
highlight that shadow you can also do
that go to Shadow andbe we can
increase the blow
perspectives and distance perspectives
to 15 that looks fine and now you can
also add in some more uh visuals to your
dashboard so let's add
another take care of the C there you go
now you can
sort of arrange
the
visual and then you can also change the
color and you can also add an effect to
this
you can also have a gradient fill for
this that go with this particular
direction let's make it look something
like this
that looks
perfect now let's proceed on adding a
few more shapes to our dashboard so I'll
go with this particular one over here
remember the four parameters that we
discussed
so three could be the worth
and five could
be there you go
now I will go with the similar shade for
this and I don't want any specific
backgrounds and I want
shape shadows and I would like to
increase is the BL perspective to
15 and distance perspective
to 15 and I'd like to quickly copy paste
this particular one and now I would like
to change the shadow to the opposite
direction which gives a little more
depth so again this could
be the same 15 and this could be again
the same 15
this will be my top layer and this will
be my bottom
layer there you
go select all and go to alignment
and
up perfect
let's also add uh the percentage over
here that and you can have a text box
Che
that looks perfect and uh you can also
add a few more details like the four
parameters what we discussed right
now the utility
weight weight percentage so that should
be Center
aligned
and there you have it now let's quickly
copy paste these to here and this will
be our
interest
ratio and this will be our utility
percentage if we have already added
credit score okay not credit score you
can have employment
and the last one will be the credit
score the Civil
score now we need another similar one
which will show the graph of our uh
customers
percentages right so this one and uh you
can close this
and take care of the
go there you
go so so good so if you want you can
also add another
tag it's
performance have it
what you can do is quickly save this
PowerPoint presentation
as dashboard
template use this particular as uh file
as gpg PNG or any of the one that you
feel like so you can when it can add a
gpg so let's go with that I would
actually go with SVG so that that it can
automatically adjust to my
dashboard scroll a little and here
you'll find it scalable back to graphics
and sa and fine so far so good now what
we have to do is proceed with um The
Next Step where we will prepare the data
for our uh project now we will be using
uh chbd only so we will be writing a
prompt for that
so our Char bd4 oh9 has been
successfully booted started and here we
have the pr so you're telling your chat
GPD that you want to create a small data
set for your uh virtual bank so that
particular virtual bank will have the
data set of all the customer customers
majorly 50 customers so you'll be having
the name of the customer customer ID
minimum uh threshold credit score
minimum credit score of the customer in
that month and maximum credit score
average of that credit score and
similarly uh minimum uh credit card
utilization maximum credit card
utilization and average of that and
employment in es how many years of
employment does this particular
candidate has and after that you have
the last one which is debit to income
ratio so the debit to income ratio is
also it can vary it can change right but
the Threshers it should be uh not
greater than
40% and here you're providing the credit
card you're providing the details over
here right Ure you create a
month-on-month data set and the credit
score should be varying from month- on
month and apart from that you're
providing some more minute details the
credit utilization could be 30 in some
month and exceed 50 in some months so it
looks a little more realistic and lastly
you also adding uh another statement
make it look realistic so this is the
prom so this prom will be copied and
pasted onto your chat GPT
omline now don't worry this prom will be
available for you too as well in the
description box below just fire the
command and shortly you will be seeing
that Omni will create a data set for you
which is downloadable
there you go the data set is ready so it
has provided U customers customer ID
they are thresholded with this and the
minimum credit score what they had the
maximum credit score what they had and
the average of that and here you have
the credit score percentage so we've
already included the formulas here so if
you can see we have provided the formula
credit credit card score percentage uh
threshold credit score divided by
average credit score into 100 and and
here you also have the formulas for rest
of the parameters and the data set is
completely ready you can just click on
this button and download the data set
right now let's start creating the uh
dashboard for that let's have a quick
look on the uh data set that we
have so this is our data set these are
the employees or customers not not
employees these are the customers that
we will be dealing with and their IDs
their month- on- Monon D set their
threshold credit score minimum maximum
average credit scores and the credit
score we here and apart from that here
we have the threshold credit utilization
minimum credit utilization and maximum
credit utilization average of that and
uh employment in years so if you have an
employment above two years let's say
here we have 10 years so you have full
weight which is two right so 20% full
weight
and uh debit to income ratio here we
have it so the threshold is 40 and the
numbers which you have earned is 49 19
right so these are some realistic real
time numbers that we created using chat
gbd omline so we will be utilizing this
particular data set to build the
dashboard now let's quickly switch to
power Pi so this was the early PBI
windows we created now let's try to
create a new one so go to file and click
on new so that you have a fresh
template so here we have the fresh
template uh we don't have to take care
of this so now uh before we get started
you can uh go to the visual section and
add a canvas background and here browse
the
images dashboard template this is the
one which we created
recently and reduce the transparency see
from 100 to anywhere between 5 to four
so I'll go with five and your background
template is ready now let's import the
data set from our local file system
updated candidate data open and it will
be loading the data
shortly so there you go now click on the
data set have a quick preview of your
data and if you're set side you can just
upload the data but uh let's go to the
transformation phase okay uh we will do
that later now you have your dat set
ready there you go now we ready to build
the visuals now before we uh build the
visual just quickly check the
data so here we have average okay let me
expand this section here we have average
credit score average credit utilization
weight okay some extra columns which we
never needed so we will clean that and
DTI weight employment weight employment
in years ID and also we have the month U
and date and everything great great so
fine now uh let's have a view of the
data so we had something called as
column number 18 which we never needed
so you can just delete this particular
column
we have average credit
score crit go
wait fine so now let's go to the
visualization part and let's start
building the uh visualization now let's
go with the line graph so I'll go with
the line graph over here so line graph
has been successful successfully
imported uh let's add it here and we
might also need a slicer for employees
so let's select the slicer and let's
place it somewhere here and uh yeah so
we will be changing this visual okay
let's add the data first so it is asking
for the data now where is the name of
the employee here is the employee name
drag and drop that into the field now
now go to visuals and slice settings if
we don't want a vertical list we want to
drop down for that and uh uh we will
will be doing this in parallel right so
the modification or any sort of
aesthetic uh changes we will be doing it
in
parallel so let's expand this a little
and now let's change the vises of this
particular slice now
now I have selected a drop down slicer
heading and I want this to be bold and
I don't want a b so I don't want a
background as well now let's go to
General uh header icons FX go to FX and
transparency should be maximum okay UMX
visual
border shant
let's have a shadow for this so it looks
better and visual border color could be
okay let me add a visual border as well
and let's choose the visual border to
be
slightly uh
black Curren see maybe a little 50 or
something or a little about
F okay that's fine
and
uh let's also have rounded edges just
like uh the other ones maybe 15 is
good there you go now let's go back to
the canvas there now this is how it
looks like okay we can also maybe
improve the way the names
look go to values and I want them to be
bold so whenever I click on this so I
have bold name sections there done now
the first part is done so far so good
now coming back to the line graph which
we had okay it should have been
somewhere maybe it's it went
missing okay no problem we can select
another
time click on the line graph drag and
drop to this particular
position there you go now we will be
adding the uh prompts here month will be
in the by AIS and
uh credit score uh we will be analyzing
the credit score right so we will be
dragging average credit utilization weit
to xais and we will be changing the
uh so there you go we have the chart
over here we can expand this and make
sure that it fits the visualization or
template that we
created there you go now let's add the
data so in x-axis we want months month
on month performance so go to uh month
and drag this to x-axis and here we
would don't want year we don't want
quarter we just want month and now now
the maximum credit score or credit okay
we wanted average credit utilization
here and credit score maximum credit
score so here it is so just drag and
drop it to Y AIS so that you can see how
is the performance now go to
visuals and
here you can add markers to have points
over there and uh go
to General and go to to FX and here you
can eliminate the background we don't
want the background and maybe you can
have a visual
border okay we don't want the visual B
because we actually have it already and
uh Shadow maybe you can have the
shadow okay that's fine now go to the
visual again go to the format and here
you can change the terms of the uh
chart you can
R score
report it's not changing for some reason
but we can try once
again there you go I was supposed to
press
enter want to add few
cards so click anywhere on the template
select
card and add it to here
so that we need the utility
weight Vision we don't want the
background as well and uh go to visuals
and here category label you don't want
the category label and maybe you can
decrease the size as
well go to this and here instead of sum
we want
average and
go now you can just simply copy and
paste it to other fields as well
the
DTI the
employment and finally we have the
credit now go to the
parameters do DDI weight add
it change the aggregation from sum to
average here employment
weight change the aggregation from sum
to average and here the
credit there you go now we were supposed
to have one last parameter which is
eligibility percentage right now we need
to mathematically calculate that so for
that we might need an extra
column let's create that extra column
let's close
this two
modeling or you can go
to add a new
column and this particular column will
be eligibility
eligibility is equals to updated
data of credit card utilization we
select that
plus I'll take it
uh credit
score
plus table
name DTI we
plus name The Last One Employment
weight
enter and there you go so you have the
percentages here now go to the
visualization
again copy paste the visualization or
cut and here you will be having uh let's
go to data instead
of utility you will change that to
eligibility that we just created
drag and drop change the aggregation to
average now there you go so according to
the requirement you can just process the
dashboard and find the employees or
candidates uh with highest credits SC
and try to call now I would uh try to
call Alex Brown and I'll see if he's
eligible I can see his credit percentage
is per credit month on Mon performance
is good so in May there is some high
performance maybe due to uh appraisals
okay and he is crossing 105
requirement and let's see another one9
is also eligible so you might have to
call him and this man is also El so
there are a few which are having a
lighter lesser score and you can just
ignore them so that's how you can create
a real time Interactive banking
dashboard so if you are creating such
dashboards and if you have knowledge on
financial sector and marketing sector
this is a good add-on weight to your
resume that you know some real time
business terms so that's good so here
you have the uh hover over feature as
well so it'll give you what was the
credit score report so here he has 89
748 was the lowest year in the June and
His Highest was 1,500 so that's how it
goes and with that we have come to an
end of the session on PBI project and if
