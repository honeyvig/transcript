description all right so what is email
marketing imagine you have a digital
flyer for your store but instead of
handing it out on the street you send it
directly to people
mailboxes that's the idea behind email
marketing it's a way to connect with
people who already like your stuff and
keep them in the loop about what's going
on people sign up to receive your emails
because because they want the inside
scoop whether it's new product special
offers or fun articles you share you
then create emails with all the school
information and send them out to
everyone on your list it's like a
personal chat with all your potential
customers at once you can remind them
about your awesome store share updates
and maybe even nudge them to snag a
discount to visit your website so next
time you see a sign up for Stores email
list jump on it it's a win-win you stay
connected and they might even treat you
to a special deal all right so now let's
start with the first strategy that is
know your audience and grow your list so
the Cornerstone of any successful email
marketing strategy is a deep
understanding of your target audience
who are you trying to reach what are
their interest and pain points what kind
of content would they find valuable so
by getting inside your ideal customer's
head you can tailor your emails to
resonate with with the specific needs
and preferences once you have a clear
picture of your audience it's time to
build your email list resist the
temptation to buy pre-made list these
are often filled with inactive addresses
and even land you in hot water with spam
filters instead focus on organic list
growth by offering valuable incentives
to entice people to sign up on your
website or social media platforms so
here are some ideas to get you started
first is offer exclusive discounts or
promotions
so who doesn't love a good deal provide
sign up incentives like special
discounts Early Access to sales or free
shipping to encourage people to join
your list the next is provide valuable
content people are more likely to sign
up for an email list if they know they
will receive something worthwhile offer
downloadable ebooks white papers
industry reports or access exclusive
content in exchange for their email
address the next is run contest or
giveaways so everyone a chance to win
host contest or giveaways with
attractive prizes to incentivize signups
and boost brand
awareness all right so this was about
knowing your audience and growing your
list now coming to the next strategy
which is tailoring emails for Maximum
Impact so not everyone on your email
list is the same a 25-year-old
interested in the latest fashion trends
probably won't be interested in the same
content as a 50-year-old looking for
gardening tips
this is where segmentation comes in
segmentation involves dividing your
email list into smaller groups based on
shared characteristics like demographics
interest purchase history or website
Behavior this allows you to send more
targeted emails that are more relevant
to each group leading to higher
engagement and conversions for example
you might segment your list by first
demographics so in demographics there is
age gender location then there is
interest so in interest there is product
preferences browsing Behavior Etc then
there is purchase history so past
purchases it includes spending habits
Etc then website Behavior so it involves
the pages visited and the content
downloaded so these are the things that
you can take care of while tailoring
your emails for the Maximum Impact all
right now coming to the third strategy
which is crafting perfect message so now
that you have understand your audience
and have segmented your list it's time
to craft the emails themselves here are
some key elements to consider first is
subject lines the subject line is your
first impression so Make It Count keep
it short clear and engaging use strong
verbs and highlight the email benefit to
grab attention and encourage people to
open it then there is
personalization a generic dear customer
just doesn't cut it anymore
people crave a personal touch use
subscribers names reference their past
purchases or tailor the content based on
their interest to make them feel valued
the next is content so focus on
providing valuable and informative
content that addresses your audience
needs keep it clear concise and easy to
read use bullet points images and videos
to break up the text and enhanced
readability then next is call to action
or CTA don't leave your subscribers
guessing tell them what you want them to
do after reading your email whether it's
visiting your website making a purchase
downloading a resource or subscribing to
your blog make your CTA clear and easy
to
follow all right so this was about
crafting a perfect message now coming to
the next strategy on our list which is
scheduling and mobile
friendliness so the timing and format of
your emails can significantly impact
their effectiveness consider these
factors send time so there is no point
in sending an email at 3:00 a.m.
research your target audience typically
online behavior and time zone to
schedule emails for when they are most
likely to be opened and engaged then
mobile friendliness most people check
their emails on their phones ensure your
emails are responsive and display well
on all devices including smartphones Etc
now things you should do is keep it
concise people are more likely to skim
on mobile Dev devices use short
paragraphs bullet points and clear
headings to break up the text the next
is optimize images large images can slow
down loading times on mobile devices
desize images and use alt text to ensure
they display correctly and provide the
context even if they don't load fully
then use clear and large CTA buttons
that is call to action buttons make sure
your ctas are easy to find and tab on
Mobile screen so these are the things
that you can keep in mind while
scheduling all right next best strategy
is Advanced strategies for email
marketing success so once you have
mastered the fundamentals consider
