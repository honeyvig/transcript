hey everyone and welcome to the amazing
video on realtime operating system a
realtime operating system or rtos is a
type of operating system that is
designed to control and manage realtime
systems these systems require timely and
predictable responses to inputs and
events making them ideal for
applications such as automation Robotics
and embeded systems an rtos allows for
the simultaneous execution of multiple
tasks while providing precise control
over the timing and scheduling of those
tasks one of the most important features
of an rtos is its ability to handle
interrupts efficiently interrupts are
events that occur outside of the normal
execution of the system and they require
immediate action conclusively and rtos
is a specialized operating system
designed for realtime systems that
require Timely and predictable responses
to inputs and events it offers precise
control over the timing and scheduling
of the task handle interrupts
efficiently and allows for the
simultaneous execution of multiple tasks
making it ideal for a variety of
applications from automation to robotics
so if you also ever wondered what makes
a system real time and how does it
differ from regular operating systems
well you're in luck because we are about
to find out but before that do subscribe

content in future and if you want to
learn more about these types of Concepts
and Cloud Computing Services then our
CTIC post-graduate program in cloud
computing will be the right choice for
you this postgraduate program in cloud
computing will help you become an expert
in Azure and AWS this indepth course
lets you master key architectural
principles and develop the skills needed
to become a cloud expert it will help
you become an expert in designing
planning and scaling Cloud
implementations our cloud computing
course helps you master the core skill
sets required to design and deploy
dynamically scalable and reliable
applications on Microsoft Azure and AWS

mentioned in the description so let's
get started but before we Del into
realtime operating system let's first
understand what an operating system is
an operating system or Os is a software
that manages computer hardware and
software resources providing services to
computer programs and allowing them to
run efficiently examples of popular
operating systems include Windows Mac OS
and Linux now what sets realtime
operating systems apart from regular
operating systems well the key
distinction lies in the ability to
respond to events in a deterministic and
timely manner in a realtime system
meeting deadlines is of atut most
importance it must be able to complete
task within specific time constraints
known as deadlines realtime operating
systems find applications in various
critical domains such as Aerospace
automative medical devices and
Industrial Automation these systems are
designed to handle time critical task
and provide a predictable response
imagine an airbag deployment system in a
car it needs to react instantly in the
event of collision that's where real
time op operating system shine now let's
discuss two types of realtime operating
system hard real time and soft real time
in a hard real time missing a deadline
can lead to catastrophic consequences
these systems are designed to guarantee
that critical tasks are completed within
their deadlines on the other hand soft
realtime systems have more relaxed
timing constraints where missing a
deadline may not have severe
consequences but realtime operating
systems achieve their humanistic
Behavior through various mechanisms one
key component is Task scheduling tasks
are the building blocks of realtime
systems they represent the individual
units of work that need to be executed
the OS scheduler recites the order and
timing of task execution to meet the
deadlines another critical aspect is
interrupt handling interrupts are events
that occur externally or internally and
require immediate attention from the
operating system the realtime OS should
respond to these interrupts promptly and
prioritize them based on their urgency
now realtime operating systems also
employ techniques like priority
inversion avoidance where tasks with
higher priorities are not blocked by
lower priority tasks this ensures that
critical tasks are not delayed or
blocked by less important tasks now
let's talk about realtime operating
system kernels the kernel is the core
component of an operating system that
provides essential services to
Applications
and manages Hardware resources realtime
kernels are designed to handle time
critical task efficiently they provide
features such as fast context switching
minimal interrup latency and
deterministic task scheduling one
popular realtime operating system is
free Ros it's an open- Source realtime
colel widely used in embeded systems
free RTO offers a small footprint
portability and a rich set of features
it's a great choice for resource
constrained devices where efficient task
management is crucial now let's explore
some Royal world examples of realtime
operating system you'll find them in
avionic system controlling critical
aircraft functions they used in medical
devices such as pacemakers where precise
timing is vital realtime operating
systems are also employed in Traffic
Control Systems ensuring smooth traffic
flow and managing signal timings well
before we wrap up let's highlight some
challenges faced in realtime operating
systems deterministic behavior requires
careful consideration of hardware and
software interaction designing and
debugging realtime systems can be
complex due to the stringent timing
requirements additionally ensuring
system security and reliability is
crucial as any failure can have severe
consequences well in conclusion realtime
operating systems play a vital role in
time critical applications ensuring task
are completed within strict deadlines
they provide deterministic Behavior
priortize critical tasks and respond
promptly to events from automative to
medical and Industrial domains realtime
operating systems are powering the
technology that keeps our world running
smoothly well here's a success story of
one of our Learners to boost your
confidence do watch this video hey I am
Salah quatra and I am currently living
in Algeria I wanted to experience what
is like to leave I also realized that to
get a new job I needed to have a
professional certification in cloud
computing so last year I started the
post-graduate program in cloud computing
in association with ctech from s that
with this course I had the choice to
study while I contined and that is how I
got this new job offer with 60% salary
high in Finland I will be leading the
cloud computing unit of my new company
we cannot wait to start our new life in
Finland we are all that's all for
