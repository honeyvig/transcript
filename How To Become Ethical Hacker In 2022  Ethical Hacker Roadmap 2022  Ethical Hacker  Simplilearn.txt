the cyber threat scene is ever changing
one has to stay up to date with the
year's malicious trends to ensure the
business infrastructure is not caught
off guard
as hyber attacks and data breaches
become increasingly common it's more
important than ever to protect our
businesses and personal devices from
these growing threats
just like many businesses and homes have
alarm systems to protect from intruders
the same prevention is necessary to ward
off cyber crime
at its core cyber security is protection
against digital attacks
these methods protect against the
multitude of digital threats that come
to individuals and businesses
our daily life economic vitality
national security depend on a stable
safe and resilient cyberspace and these
attacks never seem to stop
in october of 2021 twitch admitted that
a hacker was able to access data that
was mistakenly exposed due to the
internet due to an error in a twitch
server configuration change
it was subsequently accessed by a
malicious third party and released
online
the company says it has no indication
that any login credentials have been
exposed and that full credit card
numbers were not exposed
hackers have so far leaked data that
include source code for the company's
streaming service an unreleased team
competitor from amazon game studios and
details of creator payouts
an anonymous poster on the 4th gen
messaging board released a 125 gb
torrent which they claim includes the
entirety of twitch and its commit
history this is a huge organization
spearheaded by a giant like amazon still
they were not able to prevent this data
breach
to further understand the need for
ethical hackers let us go through a
survey conducted by core security in
2021
according to global organization only
nine percent of the companies conduct
daily penetration testing
this number increases to 11 percent who
conduct weekly tests 17 for monthly 16
quarterly and 32 percent of
organizations conduct penetration tests
at least one or two times a year however
around 15 percent of organizations that
took part in the survey
do not take any penetration testing
responsibilities seriously
this is a growing concern
with the ease of access to a variety of
tools and harmful scripts organizations
need to be more alert and regular
ethical hacking campaigns help them stay
updated with the latest hacks and the
most vicious of exploits
but coming from a different perspective
we all know an ethical hacker has a lot
of responsibilities
what part of ethical hacking is the most
exciting part for you it can be simply
wireless network hacking or even the
fact that we can protect our data the
best when we are aware of the attacks do
let us know in the comments below
moving on let's see our agenda for the
day today
we're going to start by learning about
ethical hacking and how it helps
organizations in shaping their security
from an outsider's perspective
next we talk about the different types
of hackers and the ways they operate
under different circumstances for a
variety of reasons
moving on we take a look at the most
important skills an ethical hacker needs
to be to become an effective penetration
tester
next we go through some of the most
basic roles and responsibilities of an
ethical hacker be it working for a cyber
security firm or as a freelancer
we also learn about the distinct rules
offered in the it industry after ethical
hackers proved the mettle and are ready
to take on certain corporate positions
finally we take a look at some of the
most well-known and respected
certification when it comes to ethical
hacking this gives an edge to learners
and new beginners when applying for
respective positions in the job market
let's start by learning about ethical
hacking in general
when we talk about penetration testing
or ethical hacking we mean hacking that
is based on ethical or moral principles
and has no harmful intent
ethical hacking can be defined as any
type of hacking that has been allowed by
the owner of the target system
it might also refer to the practice of
putting in place active security
measures to safeguard systems from
malicious hackers
it is the process of subverting or
cracking a system security in order to
find vulnerabilities data breaches and
potential threats
this is known as penetration testing in
the technical world
this strategy as the name indicates
comprises seeking to enter the system
and documenting the process is necessary
the purpose of ethical hacking is to
improve the security of the network or
systems by fixing the vulnerabilities
found during testing
ethical hackers may use the same methods
and tools used during the
repeat ethical hackers may use the same
methods and tools used by malicious
hackers but with the permission of the
authorized person for the purpose of
improving the security and defending the
systems from attacks by malicious users
they
these ethical hackers are then expected
to report all the vulnerabilities and
weaknesses found during the process to
the management so appropriate steps can
be taken to mitigate those
vulnerabilities
ethical hacking has proven itself to be
quite a productive career options for
many ambitious individuals
the demand for its courses today is at
an all-time high and rightfully so it
provides you with an engaging job that
never gets tedious
some certifications like comptia plus
ceh and cisco ccna are highly acclaimed
and will teach a learner all there is to
know before dipping their toes in this
industry
to summarize an ethical hacker requires
access to target system before any
criminal hacker this allows the
organization's security personnel to
deliver a security patch to the system
thereby closing a gap for an attacker to
enter the system or perform a hack
now that we understand the need and the
basic requirements of ethical hacking
let's learn about the different types of
ethical hackers and the unique
propositions
these days black hat hackers are the
most common perpetrators of cyber crime
the majority of the time a black hat
uses purposes financial these hackers
look for specific flaws in individual
computers in businesses and financial
systems they can hack onto your network
and get access to a personal corporate
and financial information by exploiting
any holes they find
white hat hackers are the people that
come to our aid on the dark web and in
cyber crime in general
they are the cyber security specialists
that assist the government and
businesses by doing penetration testing
and finding security flaws
white hat hackers use a variety of
tactics to defend themselves against
black hat hackers and other cyber
criminals they penetrate a system with
the noble objective of detecting flaws
and assisting the organizations in the
eradication of viruses and malware
gray hat hackers are somewhere in the
center of the white hat and black hat
hacking spectrum
they may not use their skills for
personal benefit but they may have both
positive and negative intentions for
example if a hacker sneaks into a
company and identifies a weakness he or
she may reveal it to the public or want
the company directly
when hackers use their hacking skills
for personal gain they are regarded as
black hat hackers
however grey hat hackers can ask for
remuneration in exchange for the efforts
for finding out security vulnerabilities
in a system
with the different categories of hackers
out of the way let's read about some of
the skills necessary to master ethical
hacking and penetration testing
people assume that hacking entails
hacking in a website in less than a
minute
this idea is derived from watching
movies and thus they are unaware of the
original fundamental understanding of
what it means to hack or how to execute
it so let's take a look at the abilities
needed
networking abilities are one of the most
significant requirements for becoming an
ethical hacker
the computer network is nothing more
than the connectivity of several devices
commonly referred to as hosts that are
linked via multiple channels to send
received data or media
understanding networks such as dhcp
subnetting and others can allow ethical
hackers to investigate the numerous
interconnected machines in a network and
the possible security concerns that this
may cause as well as how to deal with
them
computer skills are the knowledge and
the competence to operate computers and
related technologies
basic computer abilities often involve
data processing file management and
presentation creation
advanced computer abilities include
database management programming
spreadsheet computation
ms office spreadsheets emails are just a
few of the most important computer
abilities that can be necessary in a
corporate environment an ethical hacker
must be knowledgeable about these
technologies if they want to pursue this
career
linux is an open source community of
unix-like operating systems based on the
linux kernel
it is a free and open source operating
system variant with the source code
available for commercial or
non-commercial distribution under the
general public license
the key reason for an ethical hacker to
study linux is because it is considered
to be more secure than any other
operating system in terms of both
privacy and security
it does not imply that linux is
completely secure it does contain
viruses but it is far less vulnerable
than any other operating system as as a
result no other antivirus software is
required on a linux operating system
programming skills are another essential
ability for being an ethical hacker
it is defined as the process of
producing code that is interpreted by a
computing device to perform various
commands
so in order to improve one's programming
skills one must write and practice a lot
of code
before writing code one must select the
ideal programming language for his or
her needs
as far as ethical hacking is concerned
usually scripting languages do the job
well
the actual components of a computer such
as the cpu monitor keyboard graphics
card etc
are referred to as computer hardware
in contrast the software is a collection
of instructions that may be stored and
executed by the hardware
let's assume you wish to hack a machine
that is controlled by a computer
first we must understand the machine's
operation
finally we must gain access to the
computer that operates the equipment
now the machine will have a very
excellent software security system
nevertheless hackers do not care about
hardware security so if we have access
to it we can play with it
if one does not understand hardware how
will we be able to understand how the
motherboard works or how usbs carry data
or how cmos or buyers function together
and so on to become an ethical hacker
one also needs to have fundamental
hardware expertise
the process of recovering a product's
design required specification and
functionality from a study of its code
is known as reverse engineering
it creates a software database and uses
it to generate data the goal of reverse
engineering is to speed up maintenance
work by increasing a system's
understandability and producing the
essential documentation for a legacy
system
reverse engineering is commonly employed
in software security to guarantee that
the system is free of severe security
flaws or vulnerabilities
it contributes to the robustness of a
system therefore safeguarding it against
hackers and malware
the study and implementation of
strategies for trustworthy communication
in the presence of third parties is
known as cryptography
it is concerned with the development and
analysis of protocols that prohibit
malevolent third parties from retrieving
information communicated between two
entities
cryptography is the process of changing
a regular text message which is known as
a plain text to a non-readable form
known as ciphertext during transmission
an ethical hacker must ensure that
communication between members of the
organizations do not leak to malicious
hackers
the database management system or tbms
is at the heart of all database creation
and deletion
accessing a database where all of the
information is kept might put the firm
at risk thus it is critical to ensure
that this software is hack proof
to assist the company in building a
powerful dbms an ethical hacker must
have a comprehensive grasp of this topic
as well as different database engines
and data structures
with the necessary skills out of the way
one must be aware of the roadmap needed
for ethical hackers to venture into this
field
one can start by taking a college degree
in a technical field be it computer
science information technology or even
something like a bca or mca
next at least two plus years of work
experience in an i.t related field is
highly recommended so that the growth in
the ethical hacking field will be much
more cumulative
one can start getting simple
certifications like the comptia security
plus or the cisco ccna to start their
ethical hacking journey before finally
tackling the big certifications like the
ceh or the ec council certified ethical
hacker along with others like the oscp
certifications
once the major certifications are
acquired
hackers can approach companies to work
for them or they can work as a
freelancer assisting other organizations
in their security needs
let's say a budding ethical hacker has
managed to learn these skills and is
ready for the on-field activities what
are the responsibilities that he needs
to counter in this field
ethical hackers can be compared to
penetration testers but their work is
larger and includes a broader variety of
responsibilities
the primary responsibility of an ethical
hacker would be to gather the most
vulnerable points of an organization
that can be used against them this is a
major task since such exploits need to
be found by the ethical hacker before
the black hat hackers are aware of such
attack vectors
attacks can range from simple ddos
campaigns to extensive buffer overflow
malware
an ethical hacker must configure the
appropriate settings to prevent these
vulnerabilities from being exploited
apart from network vulnerabilities the
system database and open force function
as very easy entry points for seasoned
black hat hackers
fixing any misconfiguration or probable
attack vector is of paramount importance
and will eventually help in solidifying
the overall security index of the
organization
as the in-house security council an
ethical hacker must conduct covert
phishing campaigns and other social
engineering attacks on the company
employees
these operations serve as a very good
test on which departments need the most
training when it comes to detecting
legitimate hacking attempts from generic
ones
finally an ethical hacker must be able
to fix known issues with the system
these ethical hackers are expected to
carefully document the steps taken to
uncover the vulnerabilities and detail
exactly how they were able to compromise
the client security system
once such exploits are found and
documented they need to be patched
immediately to avoid attacks from other
blackhead hackers
with the responsibilities of ethical
hackers covered let's take a look at the
certain roles and designations ethical
hackers and cyber security personnel in
general can take up when they start
their corporate journey
the security architect takes care of
planning implementing and testing
security systems they are responsible
for protecting the data from hackers
malware and ddos attacks
since this is a senior level positions
adequate training with certification
will be expected
the job of the security architect is to
protect the network using proper
firewalls as well
the average salary can be considered to
be 20 lakhs in indian rupees or 125 000
us dollars per year
the security consultant is a flexible
and tech savvy person who protects the
organization's data and capital
they understand and analyze various
security systems in all fields
the consultant determines the different
tests like vulnerability to protect the
computer network and data
they are also capable of providing
technical guidance when required
the average salary ranges from 9 lakhs
inr or 97 000 us dollars per year
a penetration tester finds the weakness
and loopholes in the system that hackers
can use they are also called ethical
hackers or penetration testers as a
narrow term
they have a range of tools to test the
network web application or product
they also document the research and
findings to be helpful in the future
the salary ranges from 5 lakh in indian
rupees or 110 000 us dollars per year
the chief information security officer
or cso is an advanced level job for
which you will be required to handle a
security officer's team
you have the power to create your own
security measure you will also be
required to collaborate with other
stakeholders in determining the security
of the system since this is an advanced
role this there is an absolute necessity
for proper training and certification
owing to the advanced nature the salary
of this role goes from 18 lakh in indian
rupees or 176 000 us dollars per year
as a security analyst you will be
required to plan and execute various
security measures
you analyze and document the security of
the system and find the areas that are
prone to attacks
this is an entry level job if you aspire
to become a cyber security professional
the average salary is 6 lakhs in indian
rupees or 80 000 us dollars per year
with the roles and responsibilities out
of the way
let's take a look at some of the
certifications that ethical hackers can
attain before starting the journey
oscp certification and all of the
certifications that begin with an o are
offered by offensive security oscp
stands for offensive security certified
professional and is a hands-on
penetration testing course and
certification this is a step up from
other certifications
while they may be theory based like your
traditional classroom close osap is
centered around learning by doing the
training involves getting access to a
virtual lab where you will be required
to hack into different machines in an
attempt to compromise all of the
machines within the lab environment
the exam itself requires you to hack
into a certain amount of systems within
the time limit given and then you must
provide a written write-up of your
findings
the writer portion is meant to simulate
what you would be expected to do for a
client
the certification gives you a good idea
of the level of skill required to
perform a professional penetration test
the sanc g pen is another type of
certification provided under ethical
hacking
sysadmin networking and security is an
institute which offers multiple cores
and certifications with giac penetration
tester or g-pen being the most popular
one
it mainly covers in-depth technique
approaches to verifying the entire way
up through reporting and scoping
the main objectives to learn under gpen
are attacking password hashes advanced
password attacks initial target scanning
exploitation of fundamentals penetration
testing foundations moving files with
exploits and web application attacks
the ceh or certified ethical hacker is a
certification offered by ec council that
introduces people to the concepts and
techniques used by computer hackers
it is considered to be an introductory
level certification since it's primarily
theory based and doesn't require a deep
in-depth knowledge before studying for
the certification
if you are brand new and want to get a
good understanding of what a hacker does
or what the process of professional
ethical hacking looks like
the ch is a good place to start
the american company ec council is
actually headquartered in alburak new
mexico and has certified over 237 000
professionals from 145 countries
the focus on education and training
people in cyber security as highlighted
by their certifications
the ch exam is a multiple choice exam
spanning 4 hours and a total of 125
questions to answer
majority of the students are able to
finish the exam under 3 hours
considering the theatrical
repeat majority of the students are able
to finish the exam under 3 hours
considering the theoretical approach of
the test
ch covers majority of the topics needed
by ethical hackers to function as
working professionals in the idea
industry server hijacking server hacking
web application hacking hacking wireless
networks evading ids firewalls and
honeypots buffer overflow cryptography
are just a few topics being covered by
this certification among many others
