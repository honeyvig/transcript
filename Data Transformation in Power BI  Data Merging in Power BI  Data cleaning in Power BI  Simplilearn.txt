without further delay let's get started
so what exactly you mean by data
transformation in
PBI so data transformation can be a
little similar to data cleaning so
before any kind of data analytics you
might be receiving raw data from a
website Source a cql database or an
Excel file or multiple sources right
once after you receive the data whether
it is batch mode data or streaming data
you are supposed to clean it right you
might have to clean up the discrepancies
like the blank rows or the blank cells
or any irregularities in data such as
wrong data type right such discrepancies
from the data should be eliminated in
the first stage of data analytics so
that's exactly where data cleaning and
data transformation comes into the
picture so you have various tools for
data cleaning and data transformation
like Excel SQL
but if you are a powerbi user then good
news for you power query and powerbi can
assist you in terms of data
Transformations so in this tutorial we
will be discussing the fundamental the
most important day-to-day data
Transformations which a data analyst
takes care of in the process of data
analysis is what we going to discuss
today so let's quickly switch to powerbi
but before that let's have a overview of
what kind of data we are exactly dealing
with today so we are dealing with
Superstore data and that's in Excel
format so this is our Superstore data
set and we have four tabs here the first
one is orders tab where we have customer
ID order ID date ship date ship mode and
customer name and in the second tab we
have store data set which has the
details about the customer from where he
or she is the state City postal code and
which category or subcategory did they
purchase and Order sales discount profit
everything right right and here we have
some information about any of the orders
which were returned and some people over
here so these are the four tabs that we
are dealing with today now that we have
an overview on the data that we're
dealing with let's quickly now switch to
pobi so now we are on the P window can
just discard
changes there you go let's quickly
import the data from our downloads this
this is the data that I want to deal
with today now it might take a little
while to connect to that particular data
set and load the data onto power PN just
a couple of minutes since the data set
is a little too heavy it's about
10,000 so let's wait shouldn't take
long
there you go the data go successfully
loaded so you have the option of loading
what kind of data you want you have four
tabs as we just discussed you can load
the orders Tab and you can load the
stores Tab and in case if you want the
returns tab you can also load that and
if you want all of those just load all
of those right now I just want the to
apps orders and stores now here I can
just directly load to get started
working on this but in case I don't want
any kind of discrepancies in case if I
have a doubt that this data might not be
cleaned I shall go with data
transformation so ideally you should go
with data transformation check your data
first before any kind of analytical
processes so let's go with that
transform
data and shortly we should be having the
power query window open on our desktop
screens
so there you go you can see the complete
data set has been successfully uploaded
both these stores and alter data sets
now uh let's quickly check the data from
our data set so here you can see we have
orders date right but I can see 4
2682 and
4253 this is not in the form of dat
correct so this is the simple uh uh step
that we discussed changing the wrong
data typ so you can just click on the
lower arrow button over here and
uh you can right click and here you have
an option to change the type correct so
it is considering it as a whole number
which is wrong so you can change it
to
date replace
current so now we trying to change the
order date from a data typee whole
number to date data type so there is
some error if you click on error or if
you just navigate onto it powerp should
be able to show you what error was it
and just in case if it's not working
okay we are unable to pass the value
provided so you can just remove that and
try it in a different way change type
to date and time
zone
date I think this should
be
helpful
or if it's not working here let's
quickly check what could be the
error
time and now let's try to refresh the
data it is taking a little while
uh we also have another information that
to deal with we have the first row as
row headers so we should be declaring
PBI that we also have a row header over
here just taking a little while to
refresh meanwhile let's quickly check
into the stores data and here we have
customer name so let's try to apply
second type of data transformation which
will be like let's say split column we
have uh the complete name of U the
customer let's try to split it into
first name and second name so by D
limiter and we can give multiple options
over here left mostly limiter let's say
a person has three uh parts of his name
first name middle name and second name
or the last name so but we just wanted
to split into first and second name so
we would go with the first left most
limiter and split the D set press okay
and it should help us toplit the
data first name and second name and we
can also name the column separately as
first name and second name instead of
customer name it's taking a little while
than the ideal time but it's completely
all
right since considering the 10,000 rows
of stores data and 10,000 rows of ERS
data it is all right not a problem now
let's try to take a look at the aut
status it it has successfully changed it
no it is still showing as an error I
don't know what's wrong
here it's maybe
incomplete let's quickly refresh
all instead preview and check if can it
can help
us so there you go after refreshing the
first aut date is change to dat data
type so what we missed is when you
change the type you're supposed to add a
step so what exactly I mean by that now
we are trying to change the second one
as well so just wait for a while and it
will give us uh choice if we want to add
new step or not that's when we select
the option yes please add a new Step so
what do I mean by steps so applied steps
you can see something over here right so
every alteration every change or every
modification that you're doing every
transformation you're including onto
your data will be recorded as a macro so
that can be implemented if you are
loading a similar data set for the next
patch let's say this is 2022 data and if
you're trying to analyze the 2023 data
and every column is similar and you can
just follow these appli steps and the
same implementation will be automated
you don't have to spend time in doing
the same process once again there you go
so this time it has recorded the step
and it automatically take has taken a
new step over here change type step one
change type step two if you don't want
the step to be added you can just select
the red x mark over here it will remove
it and similarly when you when you go
back to the stor data set here you have
the first name and second name split
successfully and uh now uh let's say you
want to have unique
customer data right in that scenario you
can just even remove duplicates from
this particular column just remove
duplicates and you'll just have unique
data it's possible that one customer
might have come here to buy the same you
know buy the same product from different
dates or One customer might have uh done
a repeated purchase so it's possible but
again if in case if you just wanted to
know if there is a way to eliminate
duplicate entries then you can do that
so for now let's not delete the customer
IDs here because one customer might have
visited the same store for multiple
times and might have purchased a
different uh product or might have made
the same order with multiple products
right so there is a possibility for that
let's not disturb the data set so I just
wanted you to know if there is a way to
element the duplicat from the data set
yes it is now let's also check another
possibility of data transformation so
let's say you wanted to add a new column
and identify or include some
mathematical operations for now let's
say I have sales quantity discount and
profit but I don't know what's the rate
right so here the sale is
4261 and quantity is two but I don't
know what's the rate of one for so I can
include that you can just select the
last call or where you want a new column
just go to the add new column here and
here you can just uh choose the custom
column should be somewhere over here
yeah this is the custom column and now
if you click on the custom column you
can rename the custom CL column to rate
of
product and here you can choose the
mathematical operations to be applied on
the columns so sales column insert
or double click divided by
quantity okay now it should give you the
rate of each product individual
product it is taking some sizable time
it shouldn't take so long so there you
go you have the rate of product and now
let's say you want to combine multiple
data sets for example here I have stores
data set but my stores data set doesn't
have any data related to orders and
orders does not have any data related to
customers now I want to combine these
two is there a way yes you can do that
now let's get back to stores and here go
to home option and here you have
something called merge queries so now
the stor data set has been select in the
first data set here just select the drop
down and select the second data type
orders so here you can see stores with
the current one which is in the first
place now select based on which primary
key you want to combine both so I want
to go with customer ID because both of
my data sets do have customer IDs so
I'll go with customer ID and both dates
will be combined at the end at the last
column powerbi will show me a new table
not a new new column it will give me a
table combined with all the columns in
one column you just have to expand the
column and select which columns from the
second data set you want to include in
your overall data so let's do that
practically so here you can see I just
have tables if I select the expand
column option over here you can see I
have a lot of columns here so just
deselect everything I do have row ID I
do have a customer ID what I need is
order ID order date ship date shipment
mode and customer name I do have it so
that's all I need so just press on okay
and I should have them included in my
new data set Al
together it might take a little
while so there you go we have the new
orders ID order datee ship date and ship
mode added to our data set now just
click on close and apply
and your data set is already ready for
data analysis Supply changes it is
taking a little time so at the end you
just have to click on the apply changes
and your data will be ready for analysis
so that's exactly how you can perform
data transformation in powerbi desktop
version so there you go the Rel set got
successfully loaded all over here and
you can just drag and drop them onto the
visualization spot and you can work on
your data so with that we have come to
