do you know on December 8th 2020 the
Federal Trade Commission along with 46
US states launched an antitrust lawsuit
against Facebook wondering why did this
even happen with your friendly and cozy
Facebook and Instagram platform ever
wondered how did you get those discounts
and huge Black Friday sale ads that
turned you into Rebecca from Confessions
of a Shopaholic or ever wondered how
Facebook knew it was your birthday
forget yours how did even know your
friend's birthday who was staying
halfway across the world or how did
Facebook was able to understand your
intentions about something you disclosed
with your friend on a chat or how did
Facebook even understand if you liked a
not or a post just by checking your
facial expressions through your own
camera deep text deep fake anything ring
a bell did you know that using your own
data Facebook was able to earn billions
of dollars in Revenue the revenue of
Facebook started with 1.97 billions of
dollars and currently it is at
$134.99 projected to reach up to 170 to
1880 billions of dollars in 2024 the
annual net income of Facebook was
0.37 and now it is 39 billions of
dollars just by using your data and all
these app ads and the Deep text and deep
fake platforms now let us go through it
one by one Facebook is capable to track
each and every page you like group you
join and the profiles you follow
Facebook analyzes your status updates
picking up on a language choices topics
and Etc the add you click on simply
glance tell Facebook something or
anything about you the platform cracks
data from websites with Facebook buttons
and pixels Facebook considers your
friends activity to build a fuller
picture and when it comes to anniversary
wishes like a birthday life entries are
a clear signal to Facebook about what's
going on in your life sharing photos
greetings and announcements about these
events all feed into Facebook's
understanding of your lifestyle your
phone's calendar adds another layer of
information to their understanding of
your life events your friends wishes on
Facebook strengthens the signal to
Facebook that it is a significant date
for you Facebook can use your check a
fancy restaurant on your anniversary or
a bar with your friends for your
birthday and knowing too much data about
you your activity likes Pages you follow
interests you click on tells Facebook a
lot about your hobbies political views
and even potential life Milestones
remember the elections in us this was
something to do with it Facebook
analyzes your Social Circle and events
you attend and reveal your social status
interest and even your career Parts
location data can expose where you work
live and even your favorite Hangouts
Facebook can integrate with other
services you potentially pull like
information example LinkedIn Facebook
itself might not access public records
but data Brokers can understanding your
emotions likes comments shares and even
who you follow or friend tells Facebook
about what are your emotions or
intentions on a particular post articles
you click on videos you watch and even
how long you spend looking at something
tells Facebook what kind of content
resonates with you frequency of contact
and who you message can give clues about
your Social Circles and relationships
your response to ads even if it's just
hovering over them tells Facebook what
kind of products you might be interested
in so not just Facebook there are many
many other companies who are doing the
same thing they are getting a lot of
information from the users and earning
Millions ions and billions of dollars
how this even all possible this is

without further delay let's get started
so we will start off by understanding
the agenda for today's discussion
firstly we will understand who exactly
is a data scientist then we will look
into the skills required for you to
become a data scientist and once you're
into the industry what could be your
important and critical roles and
responsibilities as a data scientist and
if you're wondering how to become one
that we have curated a step-by-step
approach or a road map to become a
successful data science professional
first who exactly is a data scientist so
a data scientist is a specialist or a
Prof professional who uses their
knowledge of mathematics statistics
probability and computer science to
extract insights from large amounts of
data the data can be from anywhere it
can be from cloud it can be from website
it can be a simple humble spreadsheet
comma separated values and anything and
everything whichever is considered to be
the form of data could be a completely
disoriented form of data unstructured
data or semi structured data or a
structured data they are like detectives
who uncover hidden patterns and Trends
to solve problems and make predictions
now the next part the skills required to
become a data scientist in 2024 and
Beyond first the programming skills so
if you want to become a data scientist
then the bread and butter of data
science are two languages R and python
Proficiency in programming languages
like Python and R is fundamental data
scientists they use these languages to
manipulate data build machine learning
models and develop data analysis scripts
the next important skill in your bucket
list is statistics and Mathematics so
data science is a big game of
probability and statistics a strong
foundation in statistics and Mathematics
is essential for understanding the
underlying principles of data analysis
hypothesis testing and machine learning
algorithms followed by that the next
important skill that you need to possess
to become a data scientist is machine
learning data scientist should have
expertise in machine learning techniques
including supervised and unsupervised
learning deep learning and reinforcement
learning the need to choose train and
evaluate models effectively moving ahead
we will discuss about the next important
skill the data manipulation remember
before you apply your machine learning
models or build an algorithm you need to
make sure that your data is topn you
need to El eliminate any discrepancies
any irrelevant entries from your data
set by using the process of data
manipulation and data cleaning skills in
data processing cleaning and
transformation are crucial data
scientists work with messy and complex
data sets so the ability to prepare data
for analysis is key skill moving ahead
we have data visualization anything you
analyze anything you extract as an
Insight canot be readable by the
stakeholders or business heads right in
those scenarios if you were able to
picturize your insights if you're able
to picturize your findings and explain
them in a visual way then that would add
a lot of impact so proficient in data
visualization skills can help data
scientists communicate their findings
effectively to both Technical and
non-technical stakeholders tools like
mattl lip cbon or tblo and powerbi are
commonly used next in the list is domain
knowledge so data analysis data science
can be applied in a wide variety of
domain it can be either in a
Manufacturing Company automobile company
fashion food Etc right so you need to
understand your domain in a much better
way before you dwell into the data
science understanding the specific
industry or domain in which they work as
valuable domain knowledge allows data
scientist to ask relevant questions
identify meaningful patterns and provide
actionable insights now we will continue
with the import and critical roles and
responsibilities of a data scientist so
there are six crucial roles and
responsibilities for every data
scientist data collection and cleaning
or data manipulation data transformation
and data modeling as the first step next
exploratory data analysis you will be
writing Python scripts for conducting
your exploratory data analysis model
develop M if you're working on a machine
learning model then the data
visualization once you extract all the
necessary business insights you need to
picturize them you need to visualize
them so that it is understandable to
both Technical and non-technical
stakeholders furthermore you will be
followed by feature engineering and
lastly continuous learning and
optimization now let's understand each
one of them in detail starting with data
collection and cleaning data scientists
are responsible for acquiring collecting
and cleaning data sets this involves
sourcing data from various databases
apis or other sources and ensuring its
quality by handling missing values
outliners and inconsistencies moving
ahead the second role and responsibility
is exploratory data analysis data
scientists perform Eda to gain deep
understanding of data they use
statistical and visualization techniques
to identify patterns correlations and
outliners which inform subsequent
analysis moving ahead we have the next
step which is model development
developing predictive models is a core
responsibility data scientists build
machine learning models to solve
specific business and research problems
selecting appropriate algorithms and
fine-tuning them for Optimal Performance
the next one in the list is data
visualization data scientists create
informative data visualizations and
reports to communicate their findings
and insights to non-technical
stakeholders f Ive visualization is
crucial for making data driven decisions
and also you need to make sure that your
communication skill is topnotch so that
you are on the same page with your
stakeholder and nothing is missed out
next in the list is feature engineering
feature engineering involves selecting
creating and transforming relevant
variables to improve model accuracy data
scientists are skilled in identifying
which features are more informative for
a given problem last continuous learning
and optimization data science field
evolves rapidly data scientists must
stay updated with the latest tools and
techniques and they often need to
retrain models and optimize algorithms
as new data becomes available for
business goals change now let us move
ahead into the most critical part of
today's session which is the
step-by-step road map for becoming a
successful data science professional so
