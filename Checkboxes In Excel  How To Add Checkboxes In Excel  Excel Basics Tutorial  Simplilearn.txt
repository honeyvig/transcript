hey everyone welcome to simply learns
youtube channel in this session we will
learn about how to include check boxes
in excel but before we begin let me tell
you guys that we have daily updates on
multiple technologies so if you're a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for
latest technological friends then
consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn
now without further ado let's get back
to the practical mode and try to include
some check boxes in this particular
excel spreadsheet
so you can see that i've got some data
which is first name of the employee last
name of the employee and phone number
and let us assume that your manager has
given you a task to identify all those
employees which did not give an
phone number so you wanted to identify
them using a check box right
like you will be providing a check for
all the employees that we have
received the phone numbers and you will
not be checking the employees which did
not give the phone number right so let's
try to do that so to include a check box
you might want to get into the developer
option
but for few reasons microsoft has
disabled developer option by default to
enable developer option all you have to
do is just navigate anywhere on the
ribbon here
and right click and then you can see
customize the ribbon option when you
click into it you will be redirected
into the ribbon option and here you can
see the developer option on the right
side
right this one so by default you can see
that your developer option is not
enabled to enable it you have to check
in it and there you go you have it now
so press ok and you'll have the
developer option
now go to the developer option and
select the insert option and there you
can see the check box
now draw the check box anywhere
i'll draw it over here
and there you go
you have the first checkbox right
now if you want you can even customize
this
so carefully click it
you can edit the text
and
write it as
done
now you can even copy this to all the
cells
just select and drag and there you go
now
you can go ahead and check all the
employees which you have received the
phone numbers
and you can eliminate the ones which did
not provide you with the phone numbers
that's how you can do it
and there's also another option where
you can use this
to include it in a formula
since this data is only of 25 rows you
can manually check in the data and you
can leave the data which is you have not
received
but what if you had 2500 right then you
might need formula
so in such scenarios you can use a
formula
so how do you use that so
for example
uh if this particular box is checked
then you will get a true value here and
if it's not checked you will have a
false value then you can use that
boolean value to include in your formula
right sounds interesting now let's try
to implement that
you can right click the cell and you can
find format control
then
you can see here
you have an option called
cell link here select the cell link
and press ok
so here you can see if you have checked
this the value is true
and if you uncheck this
you can see the value turned false now
you can use this particular cell
reference for including this in a
formula
now let us also check how to include
checkboxes on google sheets in google
sheet it's really simple all you have to
do is get into the insert option and you
can see a really available check box you
don't have to use any developer options
over here
and there you go you can just check and
uncheck it now with that we have come to
an end of this tutorial on check boxes
