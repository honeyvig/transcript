Ado let's get started with our one point
agenda that is how to add Excel document
into PowerPoint presentation now let us
assume that you are giving an important
presentation and you're also requested
by a manager to add the Excel document
that you have used to create that
particular report which would be
something like this when you click on it
it will open a new Excel document or
Excel Window with all the data in it
right so how do we do that let's look at
the demo now let's have a blank slide
and let's get back to this Source where
our Excel file is located that is in my
documents so we are currently in my
documents and we have the Excel file
which we used for creating that
particular report now if we copy and try
to paste it on our Excel document it
would look something like this
and clearly it's not visible and it's
not accessible right so instead of this
there is another way where you can
directly add the Excel document in the
form of logo which is a rather simple
idea all you have to do is just click on
the insert option in the toolbar then
navigate to the text group and here you
will find the option called object click
on the object and it will give your new
window where you can identify which type
of document or object you want to add
either create or create from file so we
have the file in our local system so
we'll choose create from file browse and
from browse we will go into the
documents section where we have our
Excel file click on the Excel file and
click on ok now if you want the data or
Excel file to be displayed in the form
of an icon then click on the display as
icon section and here you can change the
icon so you can choose any one of the
given options let's choose this
particular one and click on OK another
okay and there you go the icon will be
now displayed on your Microsoft
PowerPoint PPT which is completely
clickable as the previous one
whenever you click on this the Excel
document will be opened so that's how
you add Excel document into Microsoft
PowerPoint with that we have come to an

document into Microsoft PowerPoint if
