hey everyone welcome back to another
video by simply learn this is anubhav
and in this video we will be learning
about expressjs get and post methods
but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our channel already make
sure to hit the subscribe button and
press the bell icon so you will never
miss any update from simply learn
so without further ado
let's begin and see what's in it for you
first we will get the overview of
express js get and post methods
after that
we will see the expressjs get method
moving ahead we will discuss what is
post method
and then we will see how the get in post
methods works
let's begin
get in post method are the standard http
request used to create rest apis
get imposed methods are used to send and
receive significant amount of data
the client sends a request in the form
of json file and with the help of http
requests which are get post and other
methods it will go to the server and
then the server sends back the response
to the client in the form of a message
to tell what happened to the request
that was sent to the server
now
expressjs get method
get is a method that is used to request
data from the server but mainly this
method is used to read data
to handle get request in express is
pretty straightforward
get requests are to be cached and
remains in the browser history and
that's why the get method is not used
for sensitive data
to get the data we add parameters in the
url and get data in response
get method is more efficient in popular
than the post method
now we'll see expressjs post method
host method is used to create new or to
edit already existing data
this method is used to communicate with
large amount of data
the post method is secure because the
data is passed in a request body and not
visible in the url and the user is not
able to bookmark it mostly we use get
method only but when we want to send a
sensitive data we use post method
now we will see how to get the post and
get methods work
now open your visual studio code
i have already installed node and
express if you haven't install it then
you can click on the right corner of
this video to get the setup done
coming back to express get and post
methods
now what i have done here is i have
created a basic express js app
const app
require express this will install all
our express modules
now
first we will write our gate method
so let's start
first we will write get method
then we will initialize
how it will be called
will i get
this
quest
we'll create
function request parameters
request and response
then we'll write the arrow function
in this
we will send a response
to the server
hello
this is
get
request
let's
i have not initialized the brackets
let's see what i have not done oh
forgot to write this
now let's just save this file
we will run this file open your terminal
and write node
dot
and
i think i have done something wrong
let's again open the terminal
write node
dot
so it is showing server is successfully
running on port 4000
now we will open our chrome
and write localhost
enter
as i have told you earlier
this needs a parameter so we'll
initialize here
get
request
hello this is successful get request
so a request method is working fine
now
we'll go back to the post method and see
how it goes
app
dot post
request
response
response send
just like this only
just
post
hello
this is
successful
post
first
now we'll run save this first
and then run it in the terminal
yes
node
dot server is running on 4000
we have to write this
so first copy from here only
open your terminal
and here we can write
post quest enter
so what you can see here is it can't get
post request
for this to see
we need to have the
postman i'm using postman here
here i will write post method
and here i will write the
localhost 4000 and the post request
method
then we'll press
send
here
in the body part
we will see hello this is successful
post request
how this is working is because post
method is secure and data is passed in
the request body and it cannot be fixed
in the url
so with this
