YouTube channel today we will learn
about how to check if a cell value match
to a list in Excel or not let's say you
have one element in one sheet and a set
of elements in a different sheet if you
want to find it or if you want to find a
match of one single element it's very
easy just use the match function or a
lookup function or an index match
function correct but let's say you have
a list of elements that need to be
matched with another one interesting

without further delay let's get started
with the demonstration for today's
session now we have opened the Microsoft
Excel workbook here let's say we have a
fingerprint ID for all the employees in
a company now we have about 500
fingerprints here 501 fingerprints right
over here right all these employees
belong to different different
departments let's say HR department
development testing sales marketing Etc
right now here in the second sheet I
have have a specific list of employees
from HR department let's say I have
about 42 fingerprint IDs here right now
what I have to do is I have to create a
match function and
identify all the 42 HR department
employees in sheet 2 and tag them in
sheet one let's say this particular ID
belongs to an HR department then I
should be writing here
employee from HR department correct now
we have 42 entries it is fine but let's
say we had 440 or 450 entries now would
you manually go and you know copy this
and go to this sheet find Control Paste
and find all would you do this TS
manually what you do this match list
manually right 440 times this is truly
timec consuming right if there was one
single formula which you can use and
identify all those 450 employees in one
go it could be a miracle right now
that's exactly what we going to do today
so we will be using an F condition we
will be using an EAS num function and
along with that we will use the match
function so these are the three
functions that we are going to combine
together and try to identify the match
between the two lists and given an end
result if the employee belongs to the H
department or not right now let's do
that quickly now let me write the
formula equals to if condition pressed
after selected Now The Logical test is
at number so you might be having a
question is number since we have uh the
data in a mix and match it's a number
plus text Will this work for only
numbers or will this only work for
alphabets no worry it works with both
numbers as well as character type data
types now I'm going to select the ease
number function now comes the match
function so use the match function press
tab to select now the lookup value so
the first lookup value will be this
particular value which is in the cell A2
don't worry it will automatically change
when the formula enters to the next cell
right when it enters to A3 it will I
mean when it enters to B3 this A2 will
become A3 so no doubt in that now it
will be A2 comma the look up AR which
array should I look to find the match so
the lookup array is right over here I'm
ignoring A1 we starting from A2 to all
the way up till
a43 so we have provided the lookup range
or look up aray now the match St we want
the exact match no matter what right so
press St to select the exact match now
close this particular match function now
if this condition matches then we should
be typing it as or we should be getting
an end result as employee belongs to HR
department and if not you can just so
you know kind of write another text so
the formula is not completely close okay
just ignore it okay now we have to close
the brackets with the leading values so
the match function is closed and after
that we need to close the ease number
function now comes to the uh if
condition so if it is true then add this
particular value that is employe from HR
department if
not other department okay other or you
can also leave it as blank okay so this
is the formula press enter so this
particular ID belongs to other
department let's eliminate this now
let's drag okay let's name it as EMP
Department
details now let's drag the formula
across there you go now you can also add
a boundary border and now you can add a
filter and uh filter this particular
table for employee from HR department
and there is a small error in the
formula but no problem let's remove the
filter and check the error I think it
should be a about fixing the ranges so
let's fix the range function F4 so we
want uh the column to be fixed and the
row numbers can change and here the
range what we are looking at so let's
give the range once again now let's fix
fix the range F4 to fix there you go now
enter and we can also remove this for
now I don't think we need this enter and
now drag the formula yes there you go we
have all the 42 entries so previously
there was a small fixing error so we
need to fix the range of elements that
we are looking at now just eliminate the
blanks and just select employee IDs and
there you go you have all your 42
employees present in the HR department
so that's exactly how you use the match
function to match a list of elements
from from one array and match it with
another array and with that we have
