hello everyone and welcome to this
Hands-On tutorial on Docker compost in
this video we will be working with two
primary components a front end built
with HTML CSS and JavaScript and a back
end powered by nodejs doger compos in
the scenario will allow us to seamlessly
manage these components and run them in
isolated containers while simplifying
the orchestration between the services
in this video we will explore how to set
up a basic front end and backend
architecture use Docker compos to run
both services and separate containers
Define custom networks so that front-end
can communicate with the back it now
before we move on just a quick info guys
simply learn has got devops Engineers
master program you can become devops
expert with Hands-On projects in
collaboration with IBM in this course
you're going to learn about Docker
kubernetes anible terraform Prometheus
genkins Microsoft Azure DeVos
methodologies and many more so guys
hurry up now and join the course the
course link is mentioned in the
description box so guys let's get
started so guys let's start with Docker
compose so go on the Google and type
Docker
compose so you can see the first link
all over here this is the guide to the
official documentation just click on
this and here we will be navigated to
the docker compose official
documentation now what is Docker compose
guys basically Docker compose is a tool
for defining and running multicontainer
applications so multicontainer in this
sense can be your front end or a backend
service okay with Docker compose you can
use a yml file typically which is nam as
Docker compost. yml to Define multiple
Services their dependencies networks and
volumes in a single configuration file
this allows you to spin up multiple
interconnected Docker containers with
one simple command making it ideal for
Environ ments where you have complex
setups such as microservices or
multi-tier applications like web server
database cache so if I talk about
multiple container in this scenario it
can be such as we have these two files
which is a backend file and the front
end file okay so this is a sample setup
which I have created for you we are
going to learn about it now as you can
see all over here so in our backend file
we'll be having a node project okay so
here are our node modules we will have a
Docker file and a main file called
server.js then we will have certain
dependencies installed all over here
okay similarly for front end we are
having a simple index.html file script
JS then CSS okay then the corresponding
Docker file so as I have told you
earlier that Docker compose helps us to
spin multiple interconnected Docker
containers so here you have one
container and here you have one
container now the compose is going to
run these two containers so in this
scenario what I was telling but our
question arises all over here okay so
why do we use
basically Docker
compose so one of the most important
reasons what I found out is that first
you have an easier multicontainer
management with compose you don't need
to manually start and link multiple
Docker containers compose
handles it for you then you have the
declarative configuration the entire
stack or Services networks volumes which
are very very mean concepts of Docker
compost is declared in single Docker
compost. yml file then you get the
environment consistency you can ensure
that development testing and production
environments are consistent by using the
same configuration and finally you get
simplified commands which means that you
can start stop and manage complex
application with just few commands now
there are certain key Concepts so if I
talk about certain key Concepts all over
here so our first concept is
Services okay so basically services are
different containers that make up your
application for example in the scenario
we have a backend service and a
front-end service it can also be a web
service database service and cach
service now second most important
concept that we have all over here is
Network so if I talk about networks guys
so networks in Docker compose allows you
to Define how services are networked
together by default Docker compose will
set up a bridge Network so that your
services can communicate with each other
using their service names instead of IP
addresses and the third thing that we
have all over here is
volumes so if I talk about volume you
can Define persistent storage volumes in
your Docker compost. FML file this is
useful for databases or other services
that need to purs data across container
when your Docker container starts so
these are the certain important Concepts
Services networks and volume which we'll
be seeing in our doger compost file now
let us set up our workflow before that I
want you to have installed Docker
compose on your system so if you have
not installed Docker compose go all over
here install Okay suppose you have a
Linux system just click on it if you
have a Mac then you can click on it I'm
using Windows I'll click on this so now
you can install Docker desktop so I'm
using x86 64 processor so I'll click all
over here and for the same thing it
requires WSL okay so you can download
this also if you don't have in your
system so guys you can install Docker
desktop on Windows very easily the first
process you can do all over here while
installing you can just click all over
here and it is going to install your
Docker desktop so I will not do it since
I already have it or otherwise you can
do it from the command line so you can
see all over here that on your terminal
you can write Docker desktop installer
exe install then start process and then
you can copy this code very easy process
guys once you have installed your Docker
desktop then you can start creating
Docker file and Docker compose file but
always make sure when you are running a
script your Docker engine should be
running now let us discuss about
basic Docker
workflow okay so you need to Define
first of all your environment with
Docker compose yml file so the first
thing
is Define your apps
environment the docker
compose yml file okay so this file will
describe the services that need to be
started again example your front end
service backend service and a database a
Docker images to use or any specific
configuration for the services like
ports environment variables or volume so
these things you have to Define in your
Docker compose file what will be your
environment of your app
now the Second Step would be run Docker
compose up to start the services so
basically this command reads the docker
compose yml file and Spins up all the
services as containers sets up the
network and ensures that they can
communicate with each other and third
would be
run Docker compose down to stop and
clean up your process so this is a very
basic workflow for the docker compose I
hope so you would have got some brief
idea regarding this now so let us
understand the architecture of our
project so it's a very basic project
guys in this we have a backend folder in
which I have a server.js okay so if I
open this file so I'm using Express all
over here to create something suppose
what I'm going to do all over here we
will be creating a dashboard or not
simple dashboard simple label where
we'll be writing our name okay so here
you can see all over here the port we
are using is 4,000 rest don't focus on
these codes what I have written you can
just ignore this because in this video
we'll be focusing mainly on Docker files
now you can see also one thing that we
have the package. gist so type CD
backend and after that just type npmi so
it is going to install all these
dependencies I will share this code all
over here with you the GitHub link you
can copy the repo now we have done this
so after this we will be writing our
Docker compos file so all over here you
can see the first thing that I'm typing
all over here is use node okay version
22.30 because if I go to the terminal
okay first I will cross check what kind
of node version I'm using so just type
all over here
node and you can see all over here it
shows
22.30 so this is our node version so
what is the significance of this line
basically this line sets up the base
image for the docker container so node
22.30 refers to the official nodejs
image of version
22.30 from the docker Hub where it
downloads all these uh node packages and
also node package manager or npm will be
included in this now the second thing
workd sler so basically this line is
setting up the working directory inside
our container so/ app is our working
directory Docker container is a place
where your application files will be
copied so here in this container all
your application files will be copied in
this directory called SL app and then
there is a copy so copy package.json and
run npm install so you can see all over
here we have a package.json file so all
of the dependencies which are present
all over here okay will be downloaded by
Docker now copy the backend code so I
have added two dots copy dot dot what is
the significance of these two things
this command copies all the files from
the host machine to the current
directory which is SL app okay now the
first dot refers to the current
directory okay which is on your host
machine and the second directory refers
to the destination directory inside the
container which is/ app and finally we
are exporting our Port which is expose
3000 okay now we are running it on CMD
node server.js okay so this is our
official Port that we are using I hope
so you have got a bit idea regarding the
backend file now let us go to the front
end file so we have three files all over
here so this is our
index.html okay this is our script.js
where I've written certain script front
end script basically and here is our CSS
file so don't worry about all these
files you can copy from the link which
I'll be sharing in the description box
now the important file that we have to
focus on is this so if I go all over
here so the same thing from node 22.30
so I'm installing node version of this
okay from dockerhub then I'm creating a
working directory all over here so this
will be our working directory where all
the code will be copied now similarly
the two dots are here so I have
explained you earlier this is for the
host machine the address from all the
codes will be copied to the destination
which is /ab directory now here what I'm
doing guys I am running run npm install
G HTTP server so what is HTTP server so
basically this will install the HTTP
server package globally so here that's
why G flag is given okay inside the
Docker container so HTTP server is a
simple lightweight HTTP server for
serving static files and here G is
installing it globally so that it can be
accessible from anywhere within the
container this is necessary because we
are using the HTTP server to serve the
HTML CSS and JavaScript file then I'm
exposing this to P
3001 and finally I'm serving our CMD
HTTP server then there is a comma okay
then P then 3001 so this basically
specifies the default command to run
when the container start so this will
run the HTTP server okay on the port
3001 and the P option will allow you to
specify which Port the server will use
so this was all about the docker file
for the backend now we have successfully
created a Docker file for our back end
and for our front end now let us proceed
to the docker compost. yml file you can
see all over here we have we have the
version which is three okay version
three is specifying the version of
Docker compos file format being used in
this case the version is three which is
widely supported and includes the
feature like networking and volume a
doer composed version offers different
features and syntax version 3 is
compatible with Docker swam mode and
also provides a better support for
services and scaling next you see the
services block which defines the
individual container or services that
Docker compos will create and run in
this there are two Services the front
end and the back end and these services
are containers that will run in isolated
environments but can communicate through
Docker Network so you can see the build
is front end ports we are using 3001 it
is depending on the back end and network
is app Network okay so they will be
communicating on app Network similarly
for backend service the build is backend
Port is 4,000 okay network is app
Network okay driver is Bridge pretty
much fine now finally we have the
network ction so in the networks it
defines a custom Docker Network that
will allow services to communicate with
each other Docker automatically creates
default Network for services if none is
specified but here we have the custom
Network which is app Network now what is
driver bridge this is a network type
which is a kind of a bridge Network this
is a default Network driver for Docker
and provides communication between
containers within the same network now
how these services will be interacting
so the fronted service which will serve
the static file the HTML CSS and
JavaScript on the port
3001 okay now on the backend service it
is most likely to run on Port 4,000 okay
so that is one thing that we have built
all over here and this scenario suppose
we are building a typical application so
the front end will be hosted on 3001 and
the back end will be hosted on 4,000 now
let us build our Docker compose file now
in order to run this application what
you have to do guys go to your root
folder which is demo okay and type
Docker compose buil now after this what
you have to do guys just right click all
over here and you can see it will start
building our application so it has
started building our backend file okay
so you can see it has started running
now it is going to create a container
demo back end one and demo a front end
one so you can see our container is
created now it is starting the HTTP
server okay now the version we are using
okay the version we are using is
14.11 the course is disabled all over
here this is security protocol there are
lot of other options that is available
so you can see the backend server is
running on Port 4,000 and still is on
the process of creating now if you
navigate to given Port which is
127.0.0.1
very basic application so just type
click your name something like
say sham and right click all over here
so it's a basic application and all the
data will be stored on the server okay
so the main agenda of this project was
how we created two Services which was
front end service and the backend
service and finally we merged the both
services with the help of Docker compost
file so two separate Docker containers
and with the help of Docker comp file we
are able to run this so this was a very
basic introduction to Docker compose I
hope so you would have got a brief idea
regarding what Docker compos does and
why it is so much popular tool in
today's software development methodology
now every job in today's scenario
requires you to understand the docker
kubernetes and all these important
devops tool so guys you can watch all
