you can prepare for a job interview by
studying weeks in advance but still
there is no guarantee that you won't be
asked a question you have no idea how to
answer the trickiest and the most
important questions are designed to help
employers gain a deeper understanding of
beyond what's listed on your assuming a
potential sales candidate for example
might be asked to talk through how they
would approach short sale cycle
differently than a long sales cycle a
candidate interviewing for a managerial
role might be asked how they'd handle
customer objections are a team conflict
these questions aren't always easy and
they often cause most people to stress
and freeze up hey everyone welcome to
another exciting video from simply learn
before we begin the session make sure
that you have subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to click that
bell icon so you can never miss an
update from simply learn so without
further ado let's get started with the
first question of this session
and
we have why do you choose google
answer when a question is asked in the
interview like this come up with a
unique answer like this
impressive record and impressive history
of the company
some of the best products that are
released by google and used by everyone
in the world and helping everyone in
several areas
clearly committed to building a diverse
workforce which is good to choose google
and the second question in the list is
do you think google should be charging
for its productivity apps
the best answer for this question is if
google charges for its productivity
applications like gmail or many more no
one is going to choose
so instead of that making a freemium
model with enhanced functionalities can
help better for the people and make them
choose google
and the next question in the list is
which number does not belong to this
series 2
3
5
8 11 13 21
the answer for this question is if we
observe the series clearly it is based
on adding the adjacent number in the
series so the number which is not
related in the series is 11. let's have
a look at the next question in the
series
and we have what does the significance
of dead beef mean
usually people respond to this question
with an answer like beef always is dead
wrong answer the correct answer is that
dead beef is a hexadecimal value that
was used in debugging back in the
mainframe or assembly days as such it
was easy to see when marking and finding
specific memory in pages of hex dumps
most computer engineers are aware of
this term
the next question we have is is your iq
more than 130
avoid this question by answering yes
the question is put to check
intellectual humility and yes could be
the worst answer to this
remembering your iq score sends a wrong
message of your insecurity and
self-aggrandizement
let's have a look at the next question
in the list
there are months with 30 days and others
with 31 days then how many months do we
have 28 days
don't try to give the answer as february
as your answer because all months have
28 days and more
now let's have a look at the next
question in the session
how many times would you need to fold
the one millimeter piece of paper in
half for it to be high enough to reach
the moon try to give an answer like
folding a one millimeter thick piece of
paper in half 42 times will make the
paper 4 million 398 46 kilometers height
which is more than the distance from the
earth to the moon
and the next question in the session we
have is why do manholes are round in
shape
the answer for this question is
it would make it harder to fit with a
cover you'd have to rotate the cover
exactly the right way therefore many
manhole covers are round so they don't
need to be rotated
there are no corners to deal with
also a round manhole cover won't fall
into the hole because it was rotated in
the wrong way
so it's safer when they are rounded
now let's have a look at the next
question in the session why do you think
that the google search page is so mainly
blank
the answer for this question is when
google was invented the founders did not
know much on web designing and
development so they left much of their
pages empty with only bare bones
designing and they left as blank
and the next question of the session is
how much should you charge to wash all
the windows in new york
give a definitive answer like 15 dollars
per window a specific answer is better
instead of a guess
next question in the list is
explain what is database to a 10 year
old kid
for these kind of questions giving an
answer like database is a machine that
stores all the information that people
used to remember and identify
and the next question in the session is
tell something about you which is not
included in your resume
for this kind of question answer the
question like
mention something you have achieved in
your current job role that's recent and
not included in your resume or talk
about a volunteering experience that you
can relate to the position or stress a
strength or skill that's essential to
the current position
the next question in the list is
who do you believe as google's main
competitors answer this question with
answer like google has several
competitors like microsoft facebook
netflix and several others depending on
the specific space
one of the main difference is google's
ability to integrate its services
creating a cross-platform experience
now let's have a look at another
question in the list
how do you explain programming and
programming languages to a 10 year old
kid the answer is if a question is asked
like this give an answer like
programming allows us to teach computers
to do specific things
a programming language is like a
language that is understandable by
computers so that makes a good
impression
the next question is
if the day before yesterday is three
days after friday what day is today
so the answer for this question is three
days after friday is monday
so the day before yesterday is monday so
the day before yesterday was tuesday and
yesterday was wednesday so today is
thursday
the next question in the session is
how
minus 2 equals 4 explain
the answer for the above question is if
you observe the question it is clearly
mentioned that 5 minus 2 is equals to 4.
so when you remove f and e from the word
5 then it then it becomes i we or in
roman it is 4 represented as 4.
the next question we have is which of
the following sets doesn't belong to the
series
a b
c
d
a e b g
z i a b
j k
l m
the answer for the above question is j k
l m doesn't belong to the series the
three remaining sets are a part of
series because all of them have a b
subset in common
and the next question in the series is
what is the biggest threat that google
faces
the answer for the above question is
that facebook is the biggest threat
facing google these days because it has
over 1 billion active users every month
the next question in the series is
how many times does a clock hand overlap
per day
so the answer for this question is clock
hand overlaps 22 times per day
now the next question in the series
describe time
where you have failed at something
how do you recover
so the answer for this question is while
i was managing a project for one of the
biggest clients in my previous company i
was so eager to please them that i told
them we would finish the project within
three weeks
so i took this experience and used it to
become much better at managing the
expectations of client during project
firstly we are going to see the beginner
level amazon interview questions now
let's have a look at the interview
questions
first question
why do you want to join amazon the
answer for this question is
the growth of the company is increasing
rapidly every day and amazon has
disrupted every industry it has set at
foot in every sector in the world
it is really about putting yourself in
the shoes of the consumer to win their
trust and confidence towards company and
the skills and personality
it also helps to excel at immersing
myself in new industries and applying
that knowledge to deliver about average
results
now second question
what are checked exceptions the answer
for this question is a checked exception
is an exception that occurs at compile
time
these are also called as compile time
exceptions
these exceptions cannot simply be
ignored at the time of compilation the
programmer should take care or handle
these exceptions for example if a file
is to be opened but the file was not
found an exception occurs
these exceptions cannot simply be
ignored at the time of compilation
question number three
what is hashing the answer for this
question is hashing is a technique used
to convert a range of key values into a
range of indexes of an array by using
the hash tables here we can create an
associative data storage where the data
index can be found by providing its key
values
now question number four
what is linear data structure
the answer for this question is a linear
data structure has elements arranged in
sequential manner and each member
element is connected to its previous and
next element
such data structures are easy to
implement as computer memory is also
sequential the examples of linear data
structure are
lists q stack array
what does algorithm mean
the answer for this question is an
algorithm is a finite sequence of
well-defined instructions
typically used to solve a class of
specific problems or to perform a
computation
algorithms are used as specifications
for performing calculations data
processing automated reasoning automated
decision making and other tasks
in contrast a heuristic is an approach
to problem solving that may not be fully
specified or may not guarantee the
correct or optimal results especially in
problem domains where there is no
well-defined correct or optimal result
the next question is what is a search
operation
the answer for this question is search
operation means whenever an element is
to be searched start searching from the
root node then if the data is less than
the k value search the element in the
left subtree or in simple terms we can
say that searching for the element in
the right subtree
the next question is what is the purpose
of ease operator in python
the answer for this question is the ease
key is used to test if two variables
refer to the same object the test
returns true if the two objects are same
objects and the test returns false if
they are not same object even if the two
objects are 100 equal use the double
equals to operator to test if two
variables are equal
asb here the results in one of the id a
equals to id b
now question eight
what is a data structure the answer for
this question is data structure is a
data organization management and storage
format that enables efficient access and
modification more precisely a data
structure is a collection of data values
the relationships among them and the
functions or operations that can be
applied to the data
next question
what is the difference between tuples
and lists in python the answer for this
question is the main differences between
the less and tuples are less are
enclosed with sequence brackets and
their elements and size can be changed
whereas tuples are enclosed in round or
parenthesis and cannot be updated
tuples can be off as read-only lists now
the next question what is the tower of
hanoi
the answer for this question is tower of
hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that
consists of three tar specs
and more than one ring all the rings are
of different sizes and stacked upon one
another where the large disc is always
below the small disc the main aim is to
move the tower of disk from one pic to
another without breaking its properties
now the next question what are
collections api
the answer for this question is
collections api is a set of classes and
interfaces that support operations on
collection of objects the primary
advantages of collection framework are
it provides interoperability between
unrelated apis
now we have the 12th question
describe a time where you have failed
something how did you recover the answer
for this question is when i was managing
a project for one of the biggest clients
in my previous company i was so eager to
please them that i told them we could
finish the project within three weeks so
i took this experience and used it to
become much better at managing the
expectations of the clients during the
project
now question number 13 tell something
about you which is not included in your
resume the answer for this question is
mention something you have achieved at
your current job that is so recent and
not included in your resume
talk about a volunteering experience
that you can relate to the position
stress a strength or skill that's
essential to the current position
question number 14
what is bfs the answer for this question
is bfs or breadth first search is an
algorithm for searching a tree data
structure for a node which satisfies the
given property
it starts at the tree root and explores
all nodes of the tree at the present
depth prior to moving to the nodes at
the next depth level the extra memory
usually a queue should be needed to keep
track of the child nodes that were
encountered but not explored
now the next question why should we hire
you the answer for this question is as a
fresher i'm looking for an opportunity
to prove my ability if i will be the
part of this company i'll put my efforts
and strengths to make your company reach
great achievements and if you hire me i
will get an opportunity to build my
professional experience through your
company now let us understand a few
intermediate level of amazon interview
questions
question number 16 what is heap in data
structure heap is a self-balanced binary
tree data structure where the root node
key is compared with the child and they
are arranged accordingly a minimum heap
is apparent note has key value less than
its child and maxi parents has greater
value than its childs
now we have question number 17 what does
success mean to you the answer for this
question is in my point of view i will
define success as fulfilling my role in
my team and the company i trust that my
employer has placed me in a position
where i'm capable of achieving the goals
of the company and my team
and so i work towards completing my
individual duties as effectively as
possible
next we have question number 18.
what does prim's algorithm find spanning
trees the answer for this question is
the premise algorithm treats the nodes
as a signal tree and keeps on adding new
nodes to the spanning tree from the
given graph
we have question number 19
what is synchronization the answer for
this question is synchronization is the
capability to control the access of
multiple threads to the shared resources
synchronized keyword in java provides
looking that ensures mutual exclusive
access of shared resources and prevents
data race now we have question number 20
list a few advantages of packages in
java
the answer for this question is packages
in java avoid the name clashes packages
in java also provide easier access
control it is easier to locate the
related classes using packages in java
next we have what is free traversal
the traversal is a process of visiting
all the nodes of a tree
all the nodes are connected via edges we
always start from the root node there
are three ways
which we use to traverse the tree which
is inorder traversal pre-order traversal
and post-order traversal
now we have question number 22 why do
you decide to go to i.t
the answer for this question is while
technical skills can get you far there's
a lot in it work that can be learned on
the job because of this employers might
look for someone who has other qualities
that can be linked to success like
passion and curiosity this question can
get also better for employers to get to
know you and your story
now we have question number 23
what are your salary expectations the
answer for this question is rather than
offering a set number of the salary you
expect provide the employer with the
range in which you'd like your salary to
fall try to keep your range tight rather
than very wide for example if you want
to make eighty thousand dollars a year a
good range offer you would make is
seventy five thousand to ninety thousand
dollars
now we have question number 24. what
does success mean to you
the answer for this question is in my
point of view i define success as
fulfilling my role in my team and the
company i trust

computer system which can be designed by
formal design and modeling techniques
now we have question number 26 describe
yourself in five words the answer for
this question is creative
diligent honest friendly and loyal
now we have question number 27 how does
kruskal's algorithm work the answer for
this question is the working of
kryskal's algorithm treats the graph as
a forest and every node as an individual
tree a tree that connects to another
only and only if it has least cost among
all available options and does not
violate mst properties
now we have question number 28 how does
depth first traversal work the answer
for this question is depth first search
algorithm traverses a graph in a depth
word motion and uses a stack to remember
to get the next vertex to start a search
when a dead end occurs in any iteration
next we have 29th question what was the
biggest mistake of your life the answer
to this question is
for these kinds of question one of the
best ways to answer this question is to
talk about specific example of a time
you made a mistake
explain what the mystic was and don't
elaborate much about it quickly switch
over what you learned or how you
improved after making that mistake
at number 30 we have what is shell sort
the answer for this question is shell
sort can be explained as a variant of
insertion sort
it divides the list into smaller sub
list based on some gap variable and then
each sub list is sorted using insertion
sort in some cases it can also perform
up to
0 n log n
now question number 31 mention some
examples of gradient algorithms the
answer for this question is
examples of greedy algorithms are
criscus minimal spanning tree algorithm
traveling salesperson knapsack problem
prim's minimal spanning tree algorithm
job scheduling problem disrupts minimal
spanning tree algorithm
graph map coloring graph vertex cover
next on number 32 we have what is
recursive function
the answer for this question is a
recursive function is a function which
calls itself directly or calls a
function that in turn calls it every
recursive function follows the recursive
properties based on criteria where
function stop calling itself and
progressive approach while the functions
tries to meet the base criteria in each
iteration
now number 33
list the types of data structures the
answer for this question is data
structures can be divided into two
categories those are linear structure
and non-linear data structures
now we have question number 34 what are
your strengths
the answer for this question is give an
answer like creativity discipline
patience determination dedication and
honesty
now we have question number 35
what are the situations that make you
angry
the answer for this question is for
these kind of questions briefly mention
the situation that agitated you and then
move on to the solution
the problem solving attitude or bent of
mind is appreciated by every interviewer
did not over exaggerate about you being
a calm and professional person
now we have question number 36 state the
properties of b3 the answer for this
question is the properties of b3 are
every node in a b3 contains at most m
children every node in a b tree except
the root node and the leaf node contain
at least a m by 2 children
the root notes in the b tree must have
at least two nodes
now we have question number 37
money or work the answer to this
question is in my point of view work is
more important to me
once we achieve and over perform the
target and help to increase the growth
of the company then definitely money
will follow us
now let's understand the advanced level
of amazon interview questions
at question number 38 we have mentioned
some examples of dynamic programming
algorithms
the answer for this question is nafsac
problem shortest path by distrust tara
of hanoi
project scheduling floyd warshall
algorithm fibonacci number series etc
now we have question number 39 what is q
in a data structure
the answer for this question is q in
data structure is an abstract data
structure in contrast to stack the queue
is open at both the ends 1n is always
used to insert data it is called as nq
and the other is used to remove data
which is called dq
queue follows fifo methodology and the
data item stored first will be accessed
first
next we have question number 14.
mention the use of default constructor
in java the answer for this question is
the purpose of default constructor in
java is to assign the default value to
the objects java compiler creates a
default constructor implicitly if there
is no constructor present in the class
now at question number 41 we have what
is a postfix expression
the answer for this question is an
expression in which the operators follow
the operands is known as postfix
expression the benefit of this form is
that there is no need to group sub
expressions in parenthesis or to
consider operator precedence
the expression a plus b will be
represented as a b plus in postfix
notation
now we have question number 42
what is selection sort
the answer for this question is
selection sort is in place sorting
technique it divides the data set into
two subsets known as sorted and unsorted
then it selects the minimum element from
the unsorted sub list and places it into
the sorted list this iterates unless all
the elements from the unsorted sub-list
are consumed into the sorted sub-list
now at question number 43 we have write
a code of inserting a node
the answer for this question is
available on my screen please feel free
to take a screenshot for future
reference
now let's move ahead into question
number 44
what is merge sort and how does it work
the answer for this question is merge
sort is a sorting algorithm based on
divide and conquer programming approach
merge sort keeps on dividing the list
into smaller sub lists until all sub
lists have one element
and then it merges them in a sorted way
until all sub lists are consumed
it has runtime complexity of 0 and log n
and it needs
0 of n auxiliary space
now we have question number 45 tell me
about a time you were unable to finish a
project and had to pivot quickly how did
you handle it
the answer for this question is at my
last job i was leading a project that
was near completion
everything was moving smoothly and on
target for timely completion then one of
our partners providing one of the
software upgrades that were to occur at
the 90 mark encountered a breach of
their systems and was estimated to delay
the project by two or four weeks instead
we were able to allocate two resources
to support the provider in recovering
from the breach in less than half of the
time that was projected
now we have question number 46
why did you leave your last job the
answer for this question is one of the
best ways to answer these kind of
questions is to be honest don't forget
to add your learnings from the situation
and how you worked on the problem areas
take care not to speak ill of your
former employer colleagues or the job
your attempt should make the answer
positive as you can
so it will be really helpful to make a
good impression on you
next we have question number 47
count possible paths in a m cross and
matrix from top left bottom to right
the code is really simple for this
question
it will be displayed on my screen
you can feel free to take a screenshot
for a future reference
now we have question number 48
write a function to give the sum of all
the numbers in the list the answer for
this question is available on my screen
the simple program segment which is a
solution of this problem is available on
my screen
now let's move ahead to the question
number 49 how to split string in java to
split a string in java the code is
really simple all you have to do is use
the function string split which is
available on my screen please take a
screenshot
now finally we have another last
question based on coding which is write
a code to find the factorial
the answer for this question is
available on my screen
you have to use a simple for loop and
the logic for
calculating the factorial numbers

they are
tcs and qt technical round managerial
round and hr round
first round tcs and qt
the first round of tcs recruitment
process is tcs nqt
which is considered as one of the most
difficult stages of the procedure it is
an ability test that evaluates a
candidate's ability and skills
tcs and qt exams are offered both online
and in person at tcs ion authorized exam
centers
the test has five sections
namely numerical ability verbal
reasoning ability programming logic and
coding
next up second round
which is a technical round
this is the most challenging stage of
the hiring process
so do your best to prepare for it
the focus of the entire interview
process will be on your technical
knowledge biography and primary projects
the technical round of the tcs interview
which is a face to face consists of
questions designed to assess the
candidate's knowledge of data structures
and algorithm database management
operating systems networking
oops concepts and a programming language
of your choice
there is a considerable chance you will
be asked to write some code on pen and
paper
third round manager along
the managerial loan is handled by a
panel of senior members
this is also a face-to-face interview
round
this round may consist entirely on your
technical questions and combination of
technical and managerial questions
the majority of the questions are based
on the profile for which you are being
interviewed
you should be up to date on any new
technologies or software required for
that position
you may also be asked questions based on
your actions to assess your thinking
style you could be put under pressure to
see how you react
your series achievements may be
questions and you may have to defend
them
you may be questioned on your previous
working experience about your objective
motivation for joining tcs and other
similar topics
the fourth and the final round hr round
this is the last stage of the hiring
process
candidates are expected to be adaptable
yet this phase allows for negotiation
most candidates believe that the hr
interview is simple but keep in mind
that a pure hr interview can jeopardize
your chances of receiving the job
even if you have cleared all the other
hurdles aptitude test technical round
etc the goal is to maintain a pleasant
and confident demeanor
interviews can be long and tedious so
remember to smile
now let's have a look at interviews
first up
who is eligible for tcs nqt
the answer for this question is
any student with any degree are allowed
for the tcs and qt
pressures and people with less than two
years of work related experience can
also apply
for this test
final year and pre-final undergraduate
and diploma students are eligible for
this application
next up to the next question
what is bfs
and the answer for this question is
breadth first search is an algorithm for
searching a tree data structure
for a node which satisfies the given
property it starts at the tree's root
and explores all the nodes of the trees
at the present depth prior to moving on
to the nodes at the next depth level
the extra memory should be needed to
keep track of the child notes that were
encountered but not explored
and the next question on the list is
what is jdk
the answer for this question would be
the java development kit is the
distribution of java technology by
oracle corporation
it implements the java language
specifications and java virtual machine
specifications that provides the
standard addition of the java
application programming interface
next up is how to split strings in java
the answer for this question is this
program
in the first line we are defining a
string str which is simply run with an
extra e
in the next line we are creating another
string arr of str
which will then use the split function
to split the string in two parts at the
position e in the next line we are using
a for loop to print out both the strings
now let's move on to next question
next question is to explain the swapping
of two numbers without using the third
variable
we can use this code to represent that
in the first line we are defining a is
equal to 2 and b is equals 4.
then we will write a code to swap the
values of a and b
first we will add a and b and store it
in a
that means now our value of a is 6 and b
is equal to 4. in the next line we will
change the value of b and subtract the
value of b from a and store it in b
so now the a is equals to 6 and b is
equals to 2
now we will change the value of a by
subtracting b from it so now a will be
equals to 4 and b will be equals to 2
hence we have swapped the value of a and
b
now next up question number 6
dislocation to write a program to check
palindrome
we can use the below code to check if
the given number is palindrome or not
first we will declare some variables
like n
number reversed equals to 0 and
remainder
we will first take value for n which
will be the number we have to find if
it's palindrome or not
then we will store the value of n in
variable number
now we will write a while loop which
will run until n becomes zero
now we will store the
last digit of the n in the remainder
we can do that by using and modulus 10.
then in the next line we are multiplying
reverse by 10 where since reverse was 0
so it will become again 0 and add
remainder to it but now the reverse
store the last digit of the number
now we will divide the
original number n by 10
so the last digit will be removed from
the original n number
we will repeat this process until the
number n is reversed
now we will check if the variable number
and the variable reversed are equal or
not if they are equal then yes it is a
palindrome
and if not that it is not a palindrome
let's move on to next question
what is recursion
the answer for the question is
recursion is a method of solving a
problem where the solution depends on
solutions to smaller instances of the
same problem
such problems can be generally be solved
by iteration but this needs to identify
and index the smaller instances of
programming time
recursive solves recursive problems by
using functions that call themselves
from within their own code
next question
what is database
the answer for the question is the
database management system
is the software that interacts with end
users applications and database itself
to capture and analyze the data
the dbms software additionally
encompasses the core facilities provided
to administer the database
the sum total of the database the dbms
and associate applications can be
referred to as a database system
often the term database is also used
loosely to refer to any of the dbms the
database systems and an application
associated with the database
next up what is jvm
a java virtual machine is a virtual
machine that enables a computer to run
java programs as well as programs
written in other languages
that are also compiled to java byte code
the jvm is detailed by specification
that formally describes what is required
in a jvm

interoperability of java programs across
different implementations so that
program authors using the jdk need not
worry about edius interests
of the underlying hardware platforms
the next question on the list is
explain the use of join function in
python

should be accessed by which user
dcl mainly includes two commands grant
and revoke
next up which is more important money or
work
in my point of view the work is more
important to me

function and dir function in python
help function
the help function is used to display the
documentation string and facilitate to
see the help related to module
keywords and
attributes the dir function is used to
display the defined symbols
and this is how we use these two
functions in python

consistency restriction for unauthorized
access easy accessibility
provide backup and recovery
and forces integrity constraints
next up we have to mention oops concepts
in c plus
there are various oops concepts in c
plus for us like class
object data binding inheritance
encapsulation
abstraction and polymorphism
next up
what is a clustered index in sql
a clustered index is a table where the
data for the row are stored
it also determines the order of the
table data based on the key values that
are stored in only one direction
and the next question on the list is
what is the purpose of a default
constructor in java
the purpose of the default constructor
in java is to assign the default value
to this object
java compiler creates a default
constructor implicitly if there is no
constructor present in class
next up is it possible to overload the
constructor
the answer for the question is the
constructors can be overloaded by
changing the data type of the parameters
or by changing the number of arguments
accepted by the constructor
what is the static variable
static variable is used to refer to the
property of all objects
like the name of employees name of
students etc
static variables gets memory allocated
only once
and the next question is is it possible
to execute a program without the mean
function
the answer is no it is not possible ever
since jdk 1.7 came out
but before jdk 1.7 using the static
block it was possible to execute without
the main method
next question
what are the functions in python
a function is a block of code that is
executed only when the function is
called
to define a function in python the def
keyword is used
next up
why do lambda forms in python do not
have the statements
lambda forms in python do not have the
statement because it is used to make the
new function object and return them in
the time
next up what is inheritance
inheritance is a mechanism of basing an
object or class upon another object a
class retaining a similar implementation
also defined as deriving new classes
which is subclasses from existing ones
such as superclass or base class
and then forming them into an hierarchy
of classes
in most class-based object-oriented
languages
an object created through inheritance
child object acquires all the properties
of the behaviors
of the parent objects
and the exception of constructor and
destructor
overloaded operators and trend functions
of the base class

data types
next up we have to list the types of
data structure
data structures are divided into two
types
they are either linear or non-linear
data structures
next up which data structure is used to
perform
recursion usually stack data structure
is used to perform recursion due to its
last and first out nature
and the next question in the list is we
have to mention operations that can be
performed on stack the operations
performed on stack are push pop and peak
these are the three operations performed
on a stack
next question in the list is what is the
queue in data structure
a queue is an ordered list that enables
insert operations to be performed at one
end called here and delete operations to
be performed
at another end called front
the next question in the list is we have
to define polymorphism
polymorphism is a provision of a single
interface of entities of different types
or the use of single symbol to represent
multiple different types this concept is
borrowed from a principle in biology
where an organism or species can have
many different forms or stages
next up what is the output of this
example
here we are given an error a and we have
to find the element at index 4.
in the above question indexing starts
from 0 and the element present at the
fourth index is 9 so the output would be
9.
next up
what is the sql query to display the
current date
there is a built-in function in sql to
display the current timestamp which is
called get date
next up

expression tree and tournamentary next
up
how would you rate yourself on the scale
of 1 to 5
the answer for this question should be
like this
i would rate myself above 4 out of 5
because i would never like to think that
there should be a room left for foot
putting in more efforts and the next
question would be what are the uses of
super keyword
the answer is
it is used to invoke the immediate
parent class method
it is also used to defer the immediate
parent class instance variable
it can also be used to invoke immediate
parent class constructor
next question is what is a constraint
a constraint is used to specify the rule
or regulation that allows and restricts
what value or data will be stored in the
table it also ensures data accuracy and
integrity inside the table
the next question in the list is what is
the
structure a structure is a user defined
data type
that allows storing multiple types of
data into a single unit
the next session in the list is we have
to mention some sql commands and the
answer to the question is
single line commands and multi-line
commands
next up
what do you mean by method overloading
method overloading is a technique a
polymorphism that allows to create
multiple methods with the same name but
the different signature
next up
what are the different types of indices
available in sql
the different types of indices available
in sql are
clustered index
non-clustered index
unique index composer index bitmap index
normal index p3 index and the function
based index
the next question in the list is
explain about top string in python
docstring is a string literal that
occurs as the first statement in
function class module or method
definition
it also provides a better way to
associate the documentation
in the last question in the list is is
it possible to override the private
method
and the answer to the question should be
it is not possible to override the
private methods because the scope of the
private method is limited to the class
and it is not possible to access them
outside of the class
why wipro
if a question asked like this come up
with an answer like wipro is india's top

you will have a variety of options based
on your professional skills wipro also
provides a good team to work with and
work life balance is excellent at web
pro
next question mention the differences
between string buffer and string builder
in java the string builder was developed
as a drop in replacement for the string
buffer so it is not synchronized it is
not thread safe
so that you can only use it when the
string buffer is used by string thread
and it is faster in most cases
string buffer was developed before the
string builder string buffer is
synchronized
so that the programs that use it take
more memory and use the time to run the
programs
now the third question
why do you want to work at a web pro
the answer for this question will be i
want to work at wipro for a great record
of innovation and success
whenever i think of how much the
technology has changed since the 1940s i
know wipro would not have been able to
thrive unless it embraced change
i'm impressed with wipro which has been
in business since 1940. now the fourth
question state the functionalities of an
operating system the answer for this
question is
the functionalities of an operating
system are an operating system provides
a user interface graphical user
interface and command line
an operating system also includes a
functionality for booting the computer
it also performs some operations for
managing and peripheral devices now the
fifth question
what do you understand about java
virtual machine
the answer for this question is jvm is a
virtual machine that enables the
computer to run the programs jvm acts
like a runtime engine that calls the
main method present in the java code jvm
is the specification that must be
implemented in the computer system

you want to work at web pro
the answer for this question is i want
to work at wipro for the great record of
innovation and success
i know bipro would not have been able to
thrive unless it has embraced the change
i'm impressed with the pro that it has
been in business since 1940.
now the next question
now the next question what is the
difference between public static and
void the difference between public
static and void are
you can access public declared variables
anywhere static declared variables are
globally accessible without creating an
instance of the class
void is a type modifier that specifies
the method that does not return any
value
next question what is sql sql stands for
structured query language it is used to
maintain the relational database and
perform
many different data manipulation
operations on the data next question
what is a class the class is a user
defined data type that contains the data
members and member functions both access
is defined by the three modifiers public
private and protected now we have the
next question
what is polymorphism
polymorphism means having more than one
function with the same name but with
different functionalities polymorphism
is divided into two categories static
polymorphism and dynamic polymorphism
what is abstraction abstraction is a
technique of showing essential details
without representing the implementation
if the members are defined with a
keyword public then the members are
accessible outside also if the members
are defined with a keyword private then
the members are not accessible by the
outside methods
what is data binding data binding is a
process of binding the application's
user interface and business logic if any
change is made in the business logic
that will be reflected directly in the
application ui
what is an object object is an instance
of a class so that you can create an
object from a class the objects of a
class are declared with the same sort of
declaration that we declare variables of
basic types
next we have what is a destructor a
destructor is used to delete any extra
resources allocated by the object a
destructor function is called
automatically once the object goes out
of the scope
next question
what are checkpoints in dbms a
checkpoint is a type of mechanism where
all the previous logs are removed from
the system and are permanently stored in
the storage disk these are checkpoints
and dbms now we have the 19th question
what is normalization
normalization is a process of analyzing
the given relationship scheme up
according to their functional
dependencies it is also used to minimize
the redundancy and also to minimize
insertion deletion and update
distractions
now we have the 20th question
what is a stack
stack is an ordered list in which
insertion and deletion can be performed
only at one end that called the top it
is a recursive data structure having a
pointer to its top element sometimes
stack is also called last in first out
or lifo list
the element which is inserted first in
the stack will be deleted last from the
stack
now we have the 21st question
what do you mean by static variable
the static variable is used to refer to
the common property of all the objects
like name of the company
college name students etc static
variable gets memory only once in the
class area at the time of class loading
next we have what is inheritance
inheritance is a mechanism in which one
object acquires all the properties and
behavior of another object of another
class it is used for code reusability
and method overriding
the idea behind the inheritance in java
is that you can create a new class that
are built on top of existing classes
what is method overloading method
overloading is a polymorphism technique
that allows us to create multiple
methods with the same name but different
parameters
is it possible to override the private
method no it is not possible to override
the private method because the scope of
private method is limited to the class
and we cannot access them outside the
class
what is the use of dcl language dcl
allows users to control access and
permission management to the database it
is a subset of database which decides
that what part of the database should be
accessed by which user at what point of
time it includes the common commands
like grant and revoke
what is a primary key
a primary key is a field or the
combination of fields that uniquely
identify each record in the table it is
one of the special kind of unique key if
the column contains a primary key it
cannot be null or empty
the table can have duplicate columns but
it cannot have more than one primary key
now the next question what is an
inconsistent dependency an inconsistent
dependency refers to the difficulty of
getting relevant data due to the missing
or broken path in the data
now we have our next question what is
tree data structure
tree data structure is a recursive data
structure containing set of one or more
data nodes where one node is designated
as the root node of the tree while the
remaining nodes are called as the child
nodes
now what does success mean to you in my
point of view i define success as
fulfilling my role in my team and the
company i trust that my employer has
placed me in a position where i'm
capable of achieving the goals of
company and my team so i work towards
completing my individual duties as
effectively as possible
now in the next question what is tree
traversal tree traversal repeat tree
traversal is a process of visiting all
the nodes of a tree all nodes are
connected via edges links we always
start from the root node head node
there are three types of tree traversal
which are in order traversal
pre-order traversal and post order
traversal
now the 31st question
how does depth first traversal work
the answer for this question is
depth first search algorithm traverses a
graph in a depth word motion and uses a
stack to remember to get the next vertex
to start search when a dead end occurs
in any iteration
now the 32nd question what is a
selection sort selection sort is in
place sorting technique it divides the
data set into two subless known as
sorted and unsorted then it selects the
minimum element from the unsorted sub
list and places it into sorted list
this iterates unless all the elements
from the unsorted sublist are consumed
into sorted sublist
now we have the 33rd question what are
the advantages of selection sorting the
advantages of selection sort are
selection sort is a simple and easy to
implement selection sort can be used for
small data sets selection sort is more
efficient than bubble sort now we have
our next question
what is an attribute an attribute refers
to a database component
it can be defined as the characteristics
of entity and can be uniquely identified
using the attributes attributes
represents the instances in the row of a
database now we have our 35th question
what is synchronization synchronization
is the capability to control the access
of multiple threads to shared resources
synchronized keyword in java provides
locking that ensures mutual exclusive
access of shared resources and prevents
data race
now we have our next question list some
application of tree data structure
the answer for this question is the
applications of tree data structure are
symbol table construction the
manipulation of arithmetic expression
hierarchical data model syntax analysis
and much more
now we have the 37 question which data
structure is used in bfs and dfs
algorithms the data structures used in
bfs and dfs algorithms are queue data
structure and stack data structure
respectively
now we have our next question now we
have a next question can we overload the
main method the answer for this question
is yes we can have any number of main
methods in java program by using method
overloading now the 39th question what
is a search operation the answer for
this question is whenever an element is
to be searched start searching from root
node then if the data is less than the k
value search for the element in the left
subtree or in simple term we can say
that searching for the element is in the
right subtree
now we have the next question what is
linear data structure a linear data
structure has data elements arranged in
sequential manner and each member
element is connected to its previous and
next element such data structures are
easy to implement as computer memory is
also sequential example list queue stack
array etc
now the next question
write a program to check palindromes the
answer for this question is displayed
right on my screen you can take a quick
screenshot for future reference

with this question is really simple the
answer is right on my screen you can use
the following code to split a string
using java programming language
here we have given
simply learn as a string and you can use
the split function in java to split it
now we have our next question what is
object learning the object cloning is
used to create the exact copy of an
object
java.lang.clonableinterface must be
implemented by the class was object
clone we want to create

advantages of dbms the few advantages of
tbms are it provides multiple user
interfaces redundancy control ensures
data consistency restriction for
unauthorized access easy accessibility
provides backup and recovery and forces
integrity constraints
now we have 45th question
what is the purpose of default
constructor in java the purpose of
default constructor in java is to assign
the default value to the objects java
compiler creates a default constructor
implicitly if there is no constructor
present in the class
now we have our next question what are
functions in python a function is a
block of code that is executed only when
the function is called to define a
function in python the def keyword is
used next we have another simple coding

my screen you can make a quick note of
it or feel free to take a screenshot for
future reference the program is written
using c programming language
now the next question
explain about
dot string in python
so the answer for this question is dog
string is a string literal that occurs
as the first statement in function class
module or method definition it also
provides a better way to associate the
documentation
now we have 49th question
