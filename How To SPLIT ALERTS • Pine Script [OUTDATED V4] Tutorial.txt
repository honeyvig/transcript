hi traders encoders my name is Matthew
from pine script mastery calm and
today's lesson I'm going to address a
question I got from a student about how
to split long alerts and short alerts so
PI script only allows you to use the
alert condition function in your script
once so if you have users who want to
split up long alerts from short alerts
and only have one of those alerts come
through in your script then how do you
achieve that well I'll show you how to
do that in this lesson but just really
quickly I just want to let you know that
this information was recorded for my PI
in script mastery course over at pine
script mastery comm and if you want to
learn more about pine script I have a
free basics course over there and I also
have a mastery course which covers
everything that you need to know about
plan scripts in order to create your own
complex indicators and strategy scripts
so if you're interested in that go and
check that out otherwise stick around
and I'll show you how to split your
trading alerts alright so here we are
with the blank script all I've done is
change the title and set overlaid it
true the first thing we're going to do
here as always is get our user input we
need two inputs here to demonstrate this
example we need to get whether the user
wants to trigger long alerts and whether
or not the user wants to trigger short
alerts so I'm going to create a new
variable here called long alerts this is
going to be a boolean input variable so
we're going to use the input function
I'm gonna give it a title of trigger
long alerts I'm gonna give it a type of
input bool short for boolean and I'm
going to give it a default value of true
and next up we have short alerts and
we're gonna do exactly the same here
just create a new input function call
I'm gonna call this one title this one
trigger short alerts and give it a type
of input bool as well and a default
value of true as well so by default both
long and short signals will be
triggering alerts the next thing we need
to do is detect our candlestick patterns
or our trading setups whatever it is
that you want to trigger your alerts
in today's example it's not about
detecting the candlestick patterns
themselves so I'm gonna keep this as
simple as possible and all we're going
to do is detect bullish candles and
bearish candles so a bullish candle is
any candle that closed higher than it
opened and a bearish candle is any
candle to close lower than it opened so
these would be our simple alert triggers
for today but you could apply this
information this logic to any alert
triggering condition no matter how
complex or simple so next up let's plot
some shapes to the chart so we know that
we are detecting these candlestick
patterns let's plot a shape when we get
a bullish candle
let's give it a color of color green
let's give it a style of shape thought
error up since it's a bullish kenneling
up and we'll give it a location of
location dot below bar geez I'm doing a
lot of typos today sorry about that so
now we can pretty much just copy and
paste this entire line of code paste in
our bearish candle condition change the
color to red change the arrow to arrow
down and change the location to above
bar so we can now get rid of our plot
clothes function every pine script
indicator script that you write needs at
least one output plot function to your
chart and plot shape will suffice so now
if we save the script add it to our
chart will be getting green arrows
underneath bullish candles and red
arrows above bearish candles so we are
detecting our signals correctly let's
now trigger our alerts and create a new
section here called trigger alerts and
I'm gonna use the alert condition
function and now this is where we need
to split our lurtz
so what we need to do here is because we
can only use one alert condition per
script we need to find a way to split
our bullish alerts and our barish alerts
so that when the user comes up into the
settings menu and turns one of these off
they no longer trigger alerts to their
phone or that chart or whatever they've
got it set to so the way we will do this
is will open a pair of parentheses here
and we'll say did we get a bullish
candle if we did this alert will trigger
but we also need to combine our long
alerts boolean condition so
say and long alerts is set to true then
we will get a bullish candle alert sent
to our phone or our charts next up we
need to detect if we had a bearish
signal so here we'll write or then open
another set of parentheses did we get a
bearish candle and if we did get a
bearish candle setup triggered to our
chart then we only want to trigger our
alert if our short alerts boolean is set
to true so here we'll say and short
alerts so that's it we've now split our
long alerts and our short alerts using
this syntax here so now this condition
will be checked if both of these
bullying's are true then an alert will
be triggered otherwise if both of these
conditions are true an alert will also
be triggered so unfortunately because
the alert condition requires constant
variables for the title and message
you cannot customize the title and
message at the moment so you can't say
you got a long alert or you got a short
alert based on one of these conditions
hopefully in Planet script version 5
that'll become a feature but for now we
are stuck with the way this works and so
we'll give this a title of just alert
and a message of alert for ticker so
pine script will replace this ticker tag
with the name of the market you're
trading so in this case New Zealand
dollar against Japanese yen so this will
be turned into NZD JPY but we'll leave
that as it is for now save the script
and we're done so now in order to use
this properly what you need to do is
come up to the settings menu and if you
only want to trigger long alerts and you
do not want to trigger any short alerts
you need to uncheck this box click OK
and then set your alert so now if you
come up to the condition box and select
our script name whatever settings you
set here will only be triggered for long
trades and serve I click create
we'll only beginning along alerts and if
I wanted to only trigger short alerts to
turn that on there and do the same thing
so I'll leave this video here and go and
manage my own trades but as I mentioned
at the start of the video this lesson is
going to go up in my pine script mastery
program so if you want to learn more
about pine script and you really want to
drill down and master this language head
over there check out my free course if
you like the free cost and I'd love to
see you in the mastery course and if not
it's not a problem
to stick around on YouTube make sure you

and I'll see you in the next video take
care and good luck with your trading
