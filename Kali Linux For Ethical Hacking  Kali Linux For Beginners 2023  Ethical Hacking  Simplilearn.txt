with cyber crime getting more and more
complex by the day corporations are in
the need of trained personnel in the
field of cyber security ethical hacking
and penetration testing had always been
necessary for organizations and the
general public to protect the system
against malicious attackers
however with the exponential growth in
cyber attacks the necessity of being
trained in ethical hacking is at an
all-time high
many such professionals tend to use
linux distributions for their
penetration testing activities there are
specific operating systems which are
catered to ethical hackers
these operating systems come
pre-installed with the necessary tools
and scripts required for ethical hacking
probably the most famous operating
system in this bracket is kali linux for
today's video we will learn about this
distribution made by and for hackers we
take you through the intricacies of its
hardware and software specifications
let's take a look at the agenda for
today
we start by learning about kali linux
and a basic explanation of its purpose
we take a look at the history of kali
linux from the story of its origin to
its current day exploits
next we learn a few distinct features of
karl linux that make it an attractive
choice for penetration testers worldwide
moving on we take a look at the multiple
ways we can install kali linux to start
our journey in the world of penetration
testing
in the next few sections we compare it
to an industry rival operating system by
the name of parrot security operating
system
we take a look at the os on our
grassroots level
next we learn about the standout
features of kali linux and parrot
security with the unique offerings
we make a direct comparison between kali
and pirate security os as far as the
hardware specifications and all around
usability is concerned
we make a conclusion as to which
operating system caters to which
category of user
in the next topic we take a detailed
look at how we can install kali linux on
a windows 10 system using the vmware
virtualization software
moving on we go through some of the
reasons why people should choose kali
linux as their primary operating system
when it comes to ethical hacking and
penetration testing
in the next section we cover the five
different phases of penetration testing
where each stage is a crucial segment in
the entire cycle for ethical hacking
campaign
we also take a look at the most popular
tools installed in kali linux that are
used regularly by ethical hackers as a
part of their professional work
coming to a few live demonstrations we
start by learning some linux terminal
basic commands set up proxy chains to
maintain a privacy on the internet
run a few nmap scans to find information
about our victims
use wireshark to detect insecure browser
traffic traveling through http web pages
learn about metasploit and its
components
and finally use metasploit to hack into
a windows 10 machine and grant ourselves
root access or the admin access which
basically gives us the key to the entire
machine
it's no secret that the majority of our
internet usage is at the risk of being
hacked be it via unsafe messaging
applications or misconfigured operating
systems
to counteract this void of digital
security penetration testing has become
the knob when it comes to vulnerability
assessment
kali linux is an operating system that
has become a well-known weapon in this
fight against hackers
a linux distribution that is made
specifically for penetration testers
kali linux has layers of features that
we will be covering in today's lesson
let's take a look at the topics to be
covered in this video
we start by learning about kali linux
and a basic explanation of its purpose
we take a look at the history of kali
linux from the story of its origin to
its current day exploits
next we learn a few distinct features of
kali that make it an attractive choice
for penetration testers worldwide
finally we take a look at the multiple
ways we can install kali linux to start
our journey in the world of penetration
testing
let's start by learning about kali linux
in general
kali linux which is formerly known as
backtrack linux is an open source linux
distribution aimed at advanced
penetration testing and security
auditing
it contains several hundred tools that
are targeted towards various information
security tasks such as penetration
testing security research computer
forensics and reverse engineering
kali linux is a multiple platform
solution accessible and freely available
to information security professionals
and hobbyists
among all the linux distributions kali
linux takes its roots from the debian
operating system
debian has been a highly dependable and
stable distribution for many years
providing a similarly strong foundation
to the kali desktop
while the operating system is capable of
practically modifying every single part
of our installation the networking
components of kali become disabled by
default this is done to prevent any
external factors from affecting the
installation procedure which may pose a
risk in critical environments
apart from boosting security it allows a
deeper element of control to the most
enthusiastic of users
we did not get kali linux since the
first day how did it come into existence
let's take a look at some of its history
kali linux is based on years of
knowledge and experience in building
penetration testing and operating
systems
during all these project lifelines there
have been only a few different
developers as the team has always been
small
the first project was called vorpx which
stands for white hat nopex
as can be inferred from the name it was
based on the nopex operating system as
its underlying os
copics had releases ranging from version
2.0 to 2.7
this made way for the next project which
was known as wax or the long hand being
white hat slacks the name change was
because the base os was changed from not
picks to slacks
wax started at version 3 as a nord it
carrying on from wapix
there was a similar os being produced at
the same time auditor security
collection often being shorted to just
auditor which was once again using nopex
its efforts were combined with wax to
produce backtrack
backtrack was based on slackware from
version 1 to version 3 but switched to
ubuntu later on with version 4 to
version 5.
using the experience gained from all of
this kali linux came after backtrack in
2013.
kali started off using debian stable as
the engine under the hood before moving
to debian testing when kali linux became
a rolling operating system
now that we understand the history and
the purpose of kali linux let us learn a
little more about its distinct features
the latest version of kali comes with
more than 600 penetration tools
pre-installed
after reviewing every tool that was
included in backtrack developers have
eliminated a great number of tools that
either simply did not work or which
duplicated other tools that provided the
same or similar functionality
the kali linux team is made up of a
small group of individuals who are the
only ones trusted to commit packages and
interact with the depositories all of
which is done using multiple secure
protocols
restricting access of critical code
bases to external asset greatly reduces
the risk of source contamination which
can cause kali linux users worldwide a
great deal of damage as a direct victim
of cyber crime
although penetration tools tend to be
written in english the developers have
ensured that kali includes true
multilingual support allowing more users
to operate in the native language and
locate the tools they need for the job
the more comfortable a user feels with
the intricacies of the operating system
the easier it is to maintain a strong
hold over the configuration and the
device in general
since arm-based single board systems
like the raspberry pi are becoming more
and more prevalent and inexpensive the
development team knew that kali's arm
support would need to be as robust as
they could manage with fully working
installations
kali linux is available on a wide range
of arm devices and has arm repositories
integrated with the mainline
distributions so the tools for arm are
updated in conjunction with the rest of
the distribution
all this information is necessary for
users to determine if kali linux is the
correct choice for them
if it is what are the ways that they can
go forward with this installation and
start their penetration testing journey
the first way to use kali linux is by
launching the distribution in the live
usb mode this can be achieved by
downloading the installer image file or
the iso file from the kali linux website
and flashing it to a usb drive with a
capacity of at least 8 gb
some people don't need to save the data
permanently and a live usb is the
perfect solution for such cases
after the iso image is flashed the thumb
drive can be used to boot a fully
working installation of the operating
system with the caviar that any changes
made to the os in this mode are not
written permanently some cases allow
persistent usage in live usbs but those
require further configuration than
normal situations
but what if the user wants to store data
permanently in the installed os
the best and the most reliable way to
ensure this is the full fledged hard
disk installation
this will ensure the complete usage of
the system's hardware capabilities and
will take into account the updates and
the configurations being made to the os
this method is supposed to overwrite any
pre-existing operating system installed
on the computer be it windows or any
other variant of linux
the next alternative route for
installing kali linux would be to use
virtualization software such as vmware
or virtualbox the software will be
installed as a separate application on
an already existing os and kali linux
can be run as an operating system in the
same computer as a window
the hardware requirements will be
completely customizable starting with
the allotted ram to the virtual hard
disk capacity
the usage of both a host and guest
operating system like our linux allows
users a safe environment to learn while
not putting their systems at risk
if you want to learn more about how one
can go forward with this method we have
a dedicated video where kali linux is
being installed on vmware while running
on a windows 10 operating system you can
find the link in the description box to
get started with your very own virtual
machine
the final way to install kali linux is
by using a dual boot system
to put it in simple words the kali linux
os will not be overwriting any
pre-installed operating system on a
machine but will be installed alongside
it when a computer boots up the user
will get a choice to boot into either of
these operating systems
many people prefer to keep both the
windows and kali linux installed so the
distribution of work and recreational
activities is also allotted effectively
it gives users a safety valve should
their custom linux installation run into
any bugs that cannot be fixed from
within the operating system
professionals in security testing
penetration testing and ethical hacking
utilize linux as their preferred
operating system
provides several configurable
distributions that new may configure
based on your end use
kali linux and parrot os are two popular
penetration testing distributions
while these operating systems each have
unique offerings the overall choice can
differ between personnel thanks to the
various tools and hardware
specifications
today we will look at both these
distributions and settle on the perfect
choice for each type of user
let's go through the agenda for this
video
we will learn about kali linux and
pirate security os from scratch while
understanding their primary selling
points as a linux distribution catered
towards penetration testers
next we know about some features of
these operating systems that stand out
of their package
finally we directly compare kal linux
and pirate security os thereby making a
clear-cut conclusion on which os is
perfect on a per requirement basis
so let's start by learning about kali
linux from a ground level
kali linux which is formerly known as
backtrack linux is an open source linux
distribution aimed at advanced
penetration testing and security
auditing
it contains several hundred tools
targeted towards various information
security tasks such as penetration
testing security research computer
forensics and reverse engineering
kali linux is a multi-platform solution
accessible and freely available to
information security professionals and
hobbyists
among all the linux distributions kali
linux takes its roots from the debian
operating system
debian has been a highly dependable and
a stable distribution for many years
providing a similarly strong foundation
to the kali linux desktop
while the operating system can
practically modify every single part of
our installation the networking
components of kali linux come disabled
by default this is done to prevent any
external factors from affecting the
installation procedure which may pose a
risk in critical environments
apart from boosting security it allows a
more profound element of security
control to the most enthusiastic of
users
now let's take a look at parent security
operating system
parent security os is a debian based
linux distribution with an emphasis on
security privacy and development
it is built on the damien's testing
branch and uses a custom hardened linux
kernel
parrot security contains several hundred
tools targeted towards tasks such as
penetration testing computer forensics
reverse engineering and security
research it is seen as a generally
lightweight distribution that can work
under rigorous hardware and software
specifications
it features a distinct forensics mode
that does not mount any of the system's
hard disks or partitions and has no
influence on the host system making it
much more stealthy than its regular
occurrence
this mode is used on the host system to
execute forensic procedures
a rolling release is a paradigm in which
software upgrades are rolled out
constantly rather than in batches of
versions in software development
this ensures that the software is
constantly up to date a rolling release
distribution such as pirate security os
follows the same concept
it provides the most recent linux kernel
and software versions as soon as they
become available
with the basic introduction to the
operating systems out of the way let us
take a look at the unique features of
both kali linux and pirate security os
the latest version of kali linux comes
with more than 600 penetration tools
pre-installed
after reviewing every tool included in
backtrack developers have eliminated a
significant number of tools that either
simply did not work or duplicated other
tools that provided the same and similar
functionality
the kali linux team comprises a small
group of individuals who are the only
ones trusted to commit packages and
interact with the repositories all of
which is done using multiple secure
protocols
restricting access of critical code
bases to external assets dramatically
reduces the risk of source contamination
which can cause kali linux users
worldwide a great deal of damage as a
direct victim of cyber crime
although penetration tools tend to be
written in english the developers have
ensured that kali includes proper
multilingual support allowing more users
to operate in the native language and
locate the tools they need for the job
the more comfortable a user feels with
the intricacies of the operating system
the easier it is to maintain a strong
hold over the configuration and the
device in general
since arm based single board systems
like the raspberry pi are becoming more
prevalent and inexpensive the
development team knew that kali's arm
support would need to be as robust as
they could manage with fully working
installations
kali linux is available on a wide range
of arm devices and has erm repositories
integrated with the mainline
distribution so the tools for arm are
updated in conjunction with the rest of
the distribution
let's take a look at some of the
features of parrot security operating
system now
along with the giant catalogue of
scripts parrot security os has its own
hardened linux kernel modified
explicitly to provide as much security
and resistance to hackers as possible in
the first line of defense
the configurations in the operating
system act as the second gateway taking
care of malicious requests and dropping
them off
this is particularly beneficial since
should there be a scenario where the
latex linux kernel is causing some
particular issue the parrot os
development team will most likely iron
it out first before passing it on as an
update
if the custom hardness kernel wasn't
reason enough parent security developers
managed to install more hacking tools
and scripts to ensure a smooth
transition for the kali linux users
all the tools you find in kali are
present in parent tools and a few extra
ones for good measure
and this has been achieved while keeping
roughly the same operating system size
between both of them
however it's not all productivity points
for pirate os
they provide a choice between two
different desktop environments mate
which comes preinstalled by default and
kde
for those unfamiliar with linux
terminology you can think of desktop
environments as the main ui for a
distribution
being highly modular in nature one can
use parent security os while adding
another desktop environment that they
find appealing
while kal linux has only a single option
parrot security has provided two
optimized builds with made desktop and
kde desktop
one of the primary advantages of parrot
os over kali linux is that it's
relatively lightweight this implies that
it takes significantly less disk space
and computing power to function
correctly with as little as 320 mb of
ram required
in reality paretos is designed to
operate successfully of a usb stick but
kali linux does not work well from a usb
thrive and is generally installed in a
virtual machine
parrot os is more of a niche
distribution if you are searching for
something lighter than kali linux
features are great but what about
performance
real world metrics
let us compare both these operating
systems directly with respect to the
hardware specifications and usability
in the end we can decide on what
distribution is fit for each type of
user
for a first point of comparison let's
take a look at the ramp required
for optimum performance of the operating
system which is highly essential when
trying to crack hashes or something of
similar nature
ram usage is a very important facet
while kali's linux demands at least 1gb
of ram pirate security can operate
optimally with a minimum of 320 mb of
ram
for correctly displaying graphical
elements kali linux requires gpu based
acceleration while this is not the case
with parrot security os which doesn't
require any graphical acceleration
needed from the user side
once these operating systems are
installed on vmware using the live boot
isos
they take up a minimum amount of hard
disk storage
both of these operating systems have a
recommended disk storage of minimum of
20 gb in kali linux and a minimum of 15
gb in parrot security so they can
install all the tools necessary in the
iso file
when it comes to the category and the
selection of tools kali linux has always
been the first in securing every single
tool available for hackers in the
penetration testing industry
parrot security on the other hand has
managed to take it up a notch
while specializing in wireless pen
testing parent security makes it a point
that all the tools that kali linux
provides has been included in the iso
while simultaneously adding some extra
tools that many users will have to
install from third party sources in kali
linux
being a decade-old penetration testing
distribution kali linux has formed up a
very big community with strong support
signature parrot security on the other
hand is still growing and it is
garnering much more interest among
veteran penetration testers and ethical
hackers
a primary drawback of kali linux is the
extensive hardware requirement
to perform optimally it requires higher
memory than parallel security it also
needs graphical acceleration while
demanding more virtual hard disk storage
pirate security on the other hand was
initially designed to run off a usb
drive directly thereby requiring very
minimal requirements from a hardware
perspective like just 320 mb of ram and
no graphical acceleration needed
this means pirate security is much more
feasible for people who are not able to
devote massive resources to either their
virtual machine or on their laptop hard
disk directly
with the comparison done between both of
these operating systems let's take a
look at the type of users both of these
are catered to
one can go with kali linux if they want
the extensive community support offered
by its users
if they want to go with a trusted
development team that have been working
on this distribution since many years
if they have a powerful system which can
run kali linux optimally without having
to bottleneck performance
and if they are comfortable with a
semi-professional environment which may
or may not be very useful for new
beginners
one can decide to go with parrot
security if they want to go with a very
lightweight and lean distribution that
can run pretty much on all systems
it also has a lot of tools pre-installed
and some of them are not even present on
kali linux
it is much more suitable for
underpowered rigs where users do not
have a lot of hardware resources to
provide to the operating system and
thereby it is much more feasible for
people with underpowered laptops or no
graphical acceleration
compared to kali linux parrot security's
desktop environment is also relatively
easier to use for new beginners
for people who are just getting into
ethical hacking pallet security does a
relatively better job
of introducing them to the operating
system and to the various tools without
having to dump them into the entire
intricacies the installation of kali
linux there are multiple ways to install
kali linux we can either install it on a
normal hard drive in a virtual machine
software such as vmware or virtualbox or
we can do that in hard bare metal
machines now for the convenience of
explanation we're going to install kali
linux today on a virtual machine
software known as vmware
vmware is able to run multiple operating
systems on a single host machine which
in our case is a windows 10 system
to get started with kali linux
installation we have to go to the
website
to download an image file
we go to get kali
and as you can see there are multiple
platforms on which this operating system
can be inverted
as per our requirement we're going to go
with the virtual message section as you
can see it is already recommended by the
developers
this is the download button which will
download a 64-bit iso file we can
download 32-bit but that is more
necessary for
hard metal machines or if you're going
to use it for older devices which do not
support 64-bit operating systems yet
after clicking on the download button
we can see we have a winrar archive
which will have the iso files
for now we have downloaded the iso file
and it is already present with me so we
can start working on the vmware side of
things
once the iso file is downloaded we open
up vmware workstation
go to file
and we create a new virtual machine
in these two options it is highly
recommended to go with the typical setup
rather than the custom one the custom is
much more advanced and requires much
more information from the user which is
beneficial for developers and people who
are well versed with virtualization
software but for 90 of the cases typical
setup will be enough
here we can select the third option
which will be i will install the
operating system later
in some operating systems we can use the
iso file here directly and vmware will
install it for us but for right now in
the case of kali linux the third option
is always the safest
kali linux is a linux distribution so we
can select linux over here and the
version as you can see here
have multiple versions such as the
multiple kernels
every distribution has of a parent
distribution for example kali linux as
debian and there are other distributions
which are based or forked from some
parent distribution
kalinas is based off debian so we can go
with the highest version of debian which
is the debian 10 point x 64 bit
go on next we can write any such name we
can write kali linux so that it will be
easier to recognize the virtual machine
among this list of virtual machine
instances
the location can be any location you
decide to put by default it should be
the documents folder but anywhere you
put it will hold up all the information
of the operating system all the files
you download all the configurations you
store everything will be stored in this
particular location that you provide
when we go next
we are asked about the disk capacity
this disk capacity will be all the
storage that will be provided to your
virtual machine of kali linux think of
your windows device
if you have a one terabyte of hard drive
you have the entirety of the hard disk
to store data on how much data you give
here you can only store up to that
amount of data not to mention some
amount of capacity will be taken up by
the operating system itself to store its
programs and applications
for now we can give around let's say 15
gb of information or if it's recommended
size for debian is 20 you can just go
ahead at 20. it depends all on the user
case if you are going to use it
extensively you can even go as high as
50 or 60 gb if you have plans to
download many more applications and
perform multiple different tests
another option we get over here is
storing virtual disk as a single file or
storing them into multiple files
as we already know this virtual machine
runs entirely on vmware
sometimes when transferring these
virtual machine instances let's say from
a personal computer to a work computer
we're going to need to copy up the
entire folder that we had mentioned
before over here
instead all virtual machines have a
portability feature now this portability
feature is possible
for all scenarios except it is much
easier if the split the virtual disk
into multiple files
now even if this makes what
porting virtual machines easier from
either
system to system or
software to software let's say if you
want to switch from vmware to virtualbox
or vice versa the performance takes a
small hit it's not
huge but it's recommended to go with
storing the virtual list as a single
file if you have no purposes of ever
moving the virtual machine even if you
do it's not a complete stop that it
cannot be ported it's just easier when
using multiple files but in order to get
the best performance out of the virtual
machine we can store it as a single file
over here
this is a summary of all the changes
that we made and all the configurations
that have been settled until now
now at this point of time we have not
provided the dot iso file yet which is
the installation file for the kali linux
that we downloaded from this website
as of right now we have only configured
the settings of the virtual machine so
we can press on finish
and we have kali linux in the list
now
to make the changes further we press on
edit virtual machine settings
the memory is supposed to give the ram
of the virtual machine
so devices with ram of 8 gb or
below that
giving high amount of ram will cause
performance issues and the host system
if the memory has some amount of free
storage left let's say on idle storage
my windows machine takes about 2 gb so i
have 6 gb of memory to provide although
if you provide all of the 6gb it will be
much more difficult for the host system
to run everything properly so for this
instance we can keep it as 2gb of memory
for the virtual machine instance
similarly we can use the number of
processors and we can customize it
according to our liking let's say if we
want to use one processor but we want to
use two different cores we can select
them as well
hard disk is pre-set up as the scsi hard
disk and it does not need to be changed
for the installation of this operating
system at all
cd id dvd this is where the installation
file comes
you can think of the iso file that we
downloaded as a pen drive or a usb thumb
drive which is necessary to install an
operating system to provide this
we're going to select use iso image file
we're going to click on browse
go and go to downloads
and select the im so file over here
select open
and you can see it is already loaded up
next in the network adapter it is
recommended to use nat
this helps the virtual machine to draw
the internet from the host machine
settings if your host machine is
connected to the internet then the
virtual machine is connected as well
there are some other options such as
host only or custom segments or lan
segments but those are not necessary for
installation
rest of them are pretty standard which
do not need any extra configuration and
can be left as it is
press ok
and now we can power on this virtual
machine
in this screen we can choose how we want
to proceed with the installation
we have a start installer option over
here
so we're going to press enter on that
we're going to wait for the things to
load from the iso file
the first step in the installation is
choosing the language of the operating
system
for this we can go with english as
standard
this is a location this will be used for
setting up the time and some of the
internal settings which depend entirely
on the location of the user
so for this we're going to go with india
configuring the keyboard it's always
recommended to go with the american
english first many people make a mistake
of going with the indian keyboard if it
is possible and it provides a lot of
issues later on so it's always preferred
to go with the american english and if
later we see some necessity of another
keyboard dialect that is required we can
install it later but for now we should
always stick with american english as a
basic
at this point it's going to load the
installation components from the dot iso
file
it is a big file of 3.6 gb so it has a
lot of components that need to be put
into the virtual machine which can also
be used to detect hardware
once the hardware and the network
configuration is done by the iso file we
want to write a hostname for the system
this hostname can be anything which is
used to recognize this device on a local
network or a lan cable let's say if we
use the name kali
domain name you we can skip it for now
it's not necessary as such for the
installation
this is the full name for the user
let's say we can provide the name as
simply learn as a full name
next we're going to set up a username
this username is going to be necessary
to identify the user from its you root
accounts and the subsequent below
accounts
for now we can give it as something as
simply123
now we have to choose a password for the
user now remember since this is the
first user that is being added onto this
newly installed operating system it
needs to be a password for the
administrator
we can use whichever password we like
over here
and use the same password below
and press on continue
at this point it's going to detect on
the components on which the operating
system can be installed
like here
there are multiple options like the use
entire disk use entire disk and setup
lvm this entire disk can set up
encrypted lvm for newcomers it is
recommended to just use the first one
since lvm encryption is something that
you can learn afterwards when you are
much more hands-on with the linux
operating system for now we are going to
use the use entire disk guided
installation and press on continue
when we set up the virtual machine on
vmware we had set up a disk capacity
there we gave our purpose 20 gb
that is the hard disk which is being
discovered here even though it is a
virtual disk
on vmware it acts as a normal hard disk
on which an operating system can be
installed
so we select this one
and press on continue
here there is a multiple partition
system
all the operating systems that are
installed have different components one
is used for the keeping of the
applications one for the files other for
the ram management and other things for
newcomers it is always recommended to
keep it in one partition
and we're going to select that and press
on continue
this is just an overview of the
partition it's going to make as you can
see it has a primary partition of 20.4
gb and a logical partition of 1 gb used
for swap memory now these kind of naming
can be confusing for people who are not
well versed with linux operating systems
or in general virtualization but for now
you can go ahead and press on continue
as this will be fine
we can press on finish partitioning and
write changes to disk
and continue
it's just a confirmation page as you can
see it showed that scsi3 is our virtual
hard disk of 20 gb disk capacity
we write the changes to the disk
we press yes and click on continue
at this point the installation has
started now this installation will take
a while depending on the
amount of ram provided the processor is
provided and how quickly the performance
of the system is being hampered by the
host machine on quicker systems this
will be rather quick while on the
smaller ones this will take a while
since this is going to take some time to
install as it is being run on a virtual
machine with only 2 gb of ram we're
going to speed up this part of the video
so we don't have to waste any more time
just watching the progress bar
now that our core installation is
completed it's asking us to configure a
package manager the work of a package
manager on linux operating system is
similar to the google play store on
android mobile devices and on the app
store for the apple devices
it's an interface to install external
applications which are not installed by
default let's say for google chrome or
any other browser which can be used to
browse the internet
at this point of time is ask us to
select a network mirror we're going to
select as yes and move forward with this
next
it's going to ask us for a http proxy
which we can leave it as blank and press
it as continue forward
at this point of time it's looking for
updates to the kali linux installation
this will fetch the new builds from the
kali server so the installation is
always updated to the latest version
now that the package manager is
configured we have the grub boot loader
the grub is used for selecting the
operating system while booting up
its core functionality is to allow the
operating system to be loaded correctly
without any faults so at this point of
time if it has installed the grub
bootloader to your primary dive we can
select it as yes and press continue
remember the installation was conducted
on dev sda
so we're going to select installation of
the loader on the same hard disk that we
have
configured we press this one and press
continue
so now the grub bootloader is being
installed
the grub is highly essential because it
is it shows the motherboard where to
start the operating system from
even if the operating system is
installed correctly and all the files
are in correct order the absence of a
bootloader will not be able to launch
the os properly
as you can see the installation is
finally complete
so now we can press on continue
and it's going to finalize the changes
now you can see kali linux being booted
up straight away it doesn't check for
the iso file anymore since the operating
system is now installed onto the virtual
hard disk storage that we had configured
before
here we're going to enter our username
and password that we had set up before
and we have the kali linux system booted
up
this is your home page
we can see the installed applications
over here which are being used for
penetration testing by multiple security
analysts worldwide
all of these come pre-installed with
kali linux and others can be installed
using the apt package manager that we
had configured
we can see a full name over here
and with this our installation of the
kali linux is complete
it's no secret that the vast bulk of
internet usage is vulnerable to hacking
whether it's through hazardous messaging
apps or faulty operating systems
penetration testing has become the norm
for vulnerability assessment in order to
fill this vacuum in digital security
kali linux is a well-known operating
system in this fight against hackers
kali linux a distribution designed
specifically for penetration testers has
layers of features that we will go over
in today's lesson and take a look at
some of the tools and features that the
operating system has to offer
let's take a look at the videos topics
and features that the operating system
has to offer
let's take a look at the videos topics
we start by learning the requirements of
an operating system like kali linux
we learn more about the core features of
the os and its intricacies
moving on we take a look at the five
distinct stages of penetration testing
that dictate the flow of vulnerability
assessment in general
next we learn about some important tools
that can be found on kali linux which
are geared specifically for ethical
hacking purposes
and finally we have an extensive
demonstration where we work on some
basic terminal commands proxy tools and

simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more let's start by
learning why one should learn kali linux
in the first place
in today's world in organizations most
valuable asset is its information or
data
this is true for all kinds of businesses
be it public or private
on a daily basis they all deal with
enormous amounts of sensitive
information
as a consequence terrorist groups
hacking teams and cyber thieves often
attack them
to ensure the safety and protection
businesses use a variety of security
measures and regularly upgrade their
index
organizations must be proactive in this
age of digitalization by regularly
assessing and updating their security
every day hackers discover new methods
to breach firewalls
ethical hackers or white hath hackers
provide a fresh perspective on security
they conduct penetration tests to
validate security measures
generally they will penetrate your
networks and give you relevant
information about your security posture
once an organization has this knowledge
it may upgrade its security procedures
accordingly
the latest version of kali linux comes
with more than 600 penetration tools
pre-installed
after reviewing every tool that was
included in backtrack developers have
eliminated a great number of tools that
either simply did not work
or which duplicated other tools that
provided the same or similar
functionality
occasionally when conducting penetration
testing or hacking we must automate our
activities since there may be hundreds
of conditions and pillows to test and
manually examining everything is time
consuming
to improve our productivity we utilize
tools that come pre-packaged with kali
linux
these tools not only save us time but
also accurately capture and process the
data
the kali linux team is made up of a
small group of individuals who are the
only ones trusted to commit packages and
interact with the repositories all of
which is done using multiple secure
protocols
restricting access of critical code
bases to external assets greatly reduces
the risk of source contamination
although penetration tools tend to be
written in english the developers have
ensured that kali includes true
multilingual support allowing more users
to operate in the native language and
locate the tools they need to do for the
job
since arm based single board systems
like the raspberry pi are becoming more
and more prevalent and inexpensive the
development team knew that kali's arm
support would need to be as robust as
they could manage with fully working
installations
kali linux is available on a wide range
of arm devices and as arm repository is
integrated with a mainline distribution
so tools for arm are updated in
conjunction with the rest of the
distribution tools
now that we understand the necessity for
an operating system like linux let us
take a look at some of its core features
and offerings to the ethical hacking
world
kali linux formerly known as backtrack
linux is an open source linux
distribution which is aimed at advanced
penetration testing and security
auditing
it contains several hundred tools
targeted towards various information
security tasks such as penetration
testing security research computer
forensics and reverse engineering kali
linux is a multi-platform solution
accessible and freely available to
information security professionals and
hobbyists
among all the linux distributions
kali linux takes its route from the
debian operating system
debian has been a highly dependable and
stable distribution for many years
providing a similarly strong foundation
to the kali linux desktop
while the operating system is capable of
practically modifying every single part
of our installation the networking
components of kali linux come disabled
by default
this is done to prevent any external
factors from affecting the installation
procedure which may pose a risk in
critical environments
apart from boosting security it allows a
deeper element of security and control
to the most enthusiastic of users
let us now take a look at the five
stages or phases of penetration testing
this is the first stage of the
penetration test which is known as the
reconnaissance phase
in this stage the security researcher
collects information about the target
it can be done actively which means you
are collecting information without
contacting the target or even both
it helps security firms gather
information about the target system
network components active machines open
ports and access points operating system
details etc
this activity can be performed by using
information available in the public
domain and using different tools
the next phase is more tool oriented
rather than perform manually and it is
the scanning phase
the penetration tester runs one or more
scanner tools to gather more information
about the target the penetration tester
runs one or more scanner tools to gather
information about the target
by using various scanners such as war
dialers port scanners network mappers
and vulnerability scanners the tester
collects as many vulnerabilities which
help to turn attack in a more
sophisticated way
the next stage is known as the gaining
access phase
in this phase the penetration tester
tries to establish a connection with the
target and exploit the vulnerabilities
found in the previous stage exploitation
may be buffer overflow attacks denial of
service or dos attacks session hijacking
and many more
basically penetration tester extracts
information and sensitive data from
servers by gaining access using
different tools
in the maintaining access phase the
penetration tester tries to create a
back door for himself
it helps him to identify hidden
vulnerabilities in the system and can
later act as a gateway to retrieve
control of the system
in the final phase of covering tracks
the penetration tester tries to remove
all logs and footprints which help the
administrator identify his presence this
helps the tester to think like a hacker
and perform corrective actions to
mitigate those activities
now that we understand the basics of
penetration testing and how ethical
hackers go about their way
let us take a look at some notable tools
which can be used on kali linux
at the top of the chain lies nmap
nmap is a free and open source utility
port scanner which can be used for
network discovery and security auditing
many systems and network administrators
also find it useful for tasks such as
network inventory managing service
upgrade schedules and monitoring host or
service uptime
it is most beneficial in the early
stages of ethical hacking that a hacker
must figure the possible entry point to
a system before running the necessary
exploits thus allowing the hacker to
leverage any insecure openings and
breach the device
it's a part of the scanning phase of the
penetration testing
nmap uses raw ip packets in novel ways
to determine what hosts are available on
the network what services these hosts
are offering what operating systems they
are running and their versions what type
of packet filters and firewalls are in
use and dozens of other characteristics
it was designed to rapidly scan large
networks but works fine against single
hosts as well
since every application that connects to
a network needs to do so via a port
the wrong port or server configuration
can open a can of worms which lead to a
thorough breach of the system and
ultimately a fully hacked device
next on the list we have metasploit
the metasploit framework is a very
powerful tool that can be used by cyber
criminals as well as ethical hackers to
probe systemic vulnerabilities on
networks and servers
as a part of the third stage of
penetration testing it's an open source
framework which can be easily customized
and used with most operating systems
with metasploit the ethical hacking team
can use a ready-made or custom code and
introduce it into a network to probe for
weak spots
as another flavor of threat hunting once
these flaws are identified and
documented the information can be used
to address systemic weaknesses and
prioritize solutions
once a particular vulnerability is
identified and the exploit is fed into
the system there are a host of options
for the hacker
depending on the vulnerability hackers
can even run root commands from the
terminal allowing complete control over
the activities of the compromised system
as well as all personal data stored on
the device
a big advantage of metasploit is the
ability to run full-fledged scans on a
target system thereby giving a detailed
picture of the security index of said
system
this also provides the necessary
exploits that can be used to bypass the
firewalls and the anti-virus software
having a single solution to gather
almost all the necessary points of
attack is very useful for ethical
hackers and penetration testers as
denoted by the high rank in this list
at number 3 we have wireshark
wireshark is the world's foremost and
widely used networking protocol analyzer
it lets you see what happening on your
network at a microscopic level and is a
de facto standard across many commercial
and non-profit enterprises government
agencies and educational institutions
wireshark is a popular open source tool
to capture network packets and converts
them to human readable binary format it
provides every single detail of the
organization's network infrastructure
it consists of devices designed to help
measure the ins and outs of the network
the information collected to wireshark
can be used for various purposes such as
real-time or offline network analysis
identification of the traffic coming on
to your network its frequency and its
latency between specific hops
this helps network administrators
generate statistics based on real-time
data
wireshark is also a cross-platform tool
that can be installed on windows linux
and mac systems to enable hackers in all
ecosystems to monitor network traffic
irrespective of the operating system
the development team is determined to
maintain this level of freedom for their
users in the foreseeable future
the next tool on our list is airgarden
which is a part of the third phase of
penetration testing
this is a multi-use bash script for
linux systems to hack and audit wireless
networks like our everyday wi-fi router
and its counterparts
along with being able to launch denial
of service attacks on compromised
networks this multi-purpose wi-fi
hacking tool has very rich features
which support multiple methods for wi-fi
hacking including multiple wps hacking
modes all-in-one wep attack handshake
file capturing evil twin attacks pixie
dust and so much more
it usually needs an external network
adapter that supports monitor mode which
is necessary to be able to capture
wireless traffic traversing the air
channels
thanks to its open source nature air
garden can be used with multiple
community plug-ins and add-ons thereby
increasing its effectiveness against a
wide variety of routers both in the 2.4
gigahertz band and 5 gigahertz band
the next tool is john the ripper
john the ripper is an open source
password security auditing and password
recovery tool available for many
operating systems
john the ripper jumbo supports hundreds
of hash and cipher types including for
use of passwords of operating systems
web apps groupware database servers
network traffic captures encrypted
private keys file systems and document
files some of the key features of the
tool include offering multiple modes to
speed up password tracking automatically
detecting the hashing algorithm used by
the passwords and the ease of running
and configuring the tool making it a
password tracking script of choice for
novices and professionals alike
it can use dictionary attacks along with
regular brute forcing to speed up the
process of cracking the correct password
without wasting additional resources
the word list being used in this
dictionary attacks can be used from the
user's end allowing for a completely
customizable
process now that we have covered the
basics of kali linux let us take a look
at the agenda for our demo today
we start out with a few terminal
commands that are a basic part of a
linux operating system
configure our own proxy chains to
maintain anonymity while running
penetration testing attacks on our
victims
next we run a few nmap scans on a local
windows 10 machine to find out the type
of information that can be gathered in
such a scenario
moving on we use wireshark to monitor
internet traffic and understand the
importance of encryption and security
when browsing the world wide web
next we learn about metasploit and its
various applications and the line of
vulnerability assessment of a device
and finally we use matrix ploy to take
root access of a fully updated windows
10 computer system
let's begin with some terminal basics on
kali linux
when most people hear the term linux
they envision a complex operating system
used only by programmers however the
experience is not as frightening as it
appears linux is an umbrella term for a
collection of free and open source unix
operating systems
there are many variants like ubuntu
fedora debian
these are distributions which will be a
more precise term
when using a linux operating system you
will most likely utilize a shell which
is a command line interface that
provides access to the operating system
services
the majority of linux distributions ship
with a graphical user interface also
known as gui as their primary shell this
is done to facilitate user interaction
in the first place
having said that a command line
interface is suggested due to its
increased power and effectiveness by
entering the commands into the cli tasks
that require a multi-step gui procedure
may be completed in a matter of seconds
we can start the terminal by clicking on
the prompt icon here on top
once the terminal is open
we can put up our commands the first
command that we are going to look into
is pwd
pwd stands for present working directory
as of right now what you are seeing is
the terminal window by default if i
write pwd and press enter
this shows the directory in which the
terminal is being run on as of right now
it's in the nf folder
of my desktop which is specifically this
folder if i open up this folder you can
see it is currently empty as in it has
no contents
if i use another command known as mkdir
which is supposed to stand for make
directory and i write an f2 shortage for
new folder 2.
if i open up the nf
you can see the new folder is created
this is how the pwd command works
another important command
to change directories it's called the cd
command let's say right now if i am in
nf i want to create a new file in nf2
folder or something else in the nf2
folder i have to shift to cd nf2
now if i write pwd
it will show the present working
directory of home simply learn desktop
nf and inside that i am in nf2 right now
it is done to navigate to the linux
files and this directories it requires
either the full path or just the name of
the directory if we have to move a
completely different folder on a
completely different file then we can
use the entire path like this
for now cd works another few commands is
we can write cd
dot dot
and it will come back one folder now the
pwd will be just nf and not nf2
let's say we are in this folder and we
want to go
a different file let's say if we just go
for cd
home
simpler
that's it
right now
these are the folders in our current
present working directory
we have the desktop the documents
downloads etc
from here we can again go to the desktop
using the same cd command
cross check the
changing of directories
and check the files again and yes there
we go nf how do we know this what are
the command that we are used to show the
files and folders that folder is known
as the ls command
ls can be used to view the contents of a
directory by default this command will
display the contents of your current
working directory if we add some other
parameters we can find the contents of
other directories as well
there are some hidden files as well in
linux which cannot be showed just with
ls for example if we just go to cd etc
which is a configuration folder for
linux
if we write ls now these are the files
that can be seen
if we want to see the hidden files we'll
have to add one more parameter here like
ls minus a and as you can see the number
of files have increased this time around
there are other things as well that we
can see with linux
ls minus al will show the hidden files
along with some of the parameters and
some of the permissions that has been
provided for each file
as you can see many of these files have
root access some of them can write some
of them can read
it differs file to file and the ls minus
al command is used to check each of
these files permission and change them
accordingly if needed
the next command that we can look for is
the cat command or concatenate
it is one of the most frequently used
commands and it is used to list the
contents of a file on the output
for example
let's say if i have a file at the
desktop
in this nf2 folder i will create a
document
create an empty file
e5
i'll open up the document
and i'll write it as
hello kali
i will save this up
now to change the directories from etc
to nf2 we have already discussed how to
use the cd command using just the folder
name now if you want to go to the entire
directory
we can write
siri
home
as you can see it is already prompting
us to complete the
name of the directory at this point we
just have to press tab
and it completes it for ourselves
next we already know we have to enter
the desktop
nf and nf2
and this brings us to the current
working directory here if we press ls
we can find a file over here now as
discussed for the concatenate it is used
to show the contents of a file so right
now if we press c80 which stands for
concatenate
e file
as you can see we have written hello
kali in the text file and we can see the
output right now
we can also use it to create new files
for example if we write cat
any file name such as e file 2
here we can write anything
hello kali
again
once we press ctrl c here
we can check e file 2 and we have hello
kali again printed over here we can see
the same using the concatenate command
as well
if i press ls you can see we have two
files here
and i can go with cat
e file 2
and i have hello kali again this is how
the concatenate command works
apart from this it can be used to copy
there is a different command like called
cp which is used to copy the files from
one place to another mind to this is not
moving this is only going to copy the
command
for example currently our pwd which is
the present working directory is in the
nf2 folder as you can see over here
let's copy the e file tool to the nf
folder
we can write cp e file 2
and give the path of the nf folder which
will be home
simply learn
desktop
nnf
now if i press ls i'll find both the
files and nf2 since i copied
to go back to the nf folder again we can
again use the same command of
no no we can again use the home
simply learn
desktop
and just nf no nf2 this time just enough
as you can see this will change back our
present working directory now when we
press ls
we will find the e file to file
and the nf2 folder and we can confirm
this using the gui as well
this is the nf folder and you can see
the nf2 folder and the e file to
document if i write cat e file 2
cat e file 2
we can see the contents of the file now
this can be done using moving as well
for example if i go to cd nf2 which is
the inside folder
it has both the
document files like e file and e file 2.
let's say i want to move the e file
completely from nf2 to nf1
instead of writing cp the command i'm
going to use is mv
mv e file and again give the path of the
folder into which i have to copy which
will be again home
simply learn
desktop
and nf
as you can see the contents of the nf2
have appeared here and e file has been
moved
from nf2 to
nf
this is this nf2 and we don't find e
file here anymore if we press cd dot dot
and we go back to nf ls right now and we
can file both the files e file that we
moved and e file to that we copied from
the nf2 folder so this is how copying
and moving will work using the terminal
now this is just a simple one line
statement that might take a couple of
clicks when using gui this is why the
command line interface is considered to
be much more streamlined for linux
operating systems
another very important
command for linux operating system is
the sudo command
sudo is short for super user do
the command enables you to perform tasks
that require administrative or root
permissions we can think of it as how we
run programs as administrator on windows
systems it is not advisable to use this
covert for daily use because it might be
easy for an error to occur and the
permissions of root are very intricate
so new beginners are
advised to use the sudo command only
when absolutely necessary for example
sudo su
with this command i am giving this
terminal
a root permission
this seo stands for this user
at this point it's going to ask for my
admin password
once i enter my password
and i now have root access
note how the password that i entered did
not show up here this is a security
measure to prevent people from snooping
on your root password which is the end
game of all this operating system
as you also can see the symbol changed
if the dollar symbol is showing its
source as a standard user when you
switch to root you can easily see a hash
symbol
this opens up a separate shell inside
this terminal command for example
we can exit out of the root user to the
standard user using the command exit and
once again we have the dollar sign and
the root has vanished over here there
are some commands that will only work
with administrative access for example
when updating the kali linux system we
have to use apt update
as you can see it says problem unlinking
the file because permission denied now
let's try this using sudo
sudo
apt update
as you can see it is updating the
package repositories which work as the
software installed on the system
this can be done using either writing
the sudo command every time we want to
perform a root access or we can just
write sudo su once and write apt update
alone
the fetching is complete over here
for the second example let's say i just
write sudo su and this time is not going
to ask me the password because at this
current terminal process i've already
provided the rules password once and it
is in memory right now
now
when we used to update the system we had
to write sudo apt update that was
because we were running it as a standard
user now we are running it as a root
user so all we have to write is apd
update
and it's going to continue its work
there you go
another command that can be useful is
the ping command
it's pretty self explanatory it's going
to be checking the internet connectivity
you can be used to check internet
connectivity or you can see if the there
is a local server on your system which
needs to be pinged then you can check
that for example you have to write ping
and we can use either ip address or
domain let's say if we want to check
that if we can access google.com using
this kali linux installation or not we
can write ping google.com
and you can see it shows the bytes being
sent and received and how much time it
took to take up the request
this can be done for local systems as
well for example this installation of
kali linux is being run on a virtual
machine
once this machine is running i still
have my
the whole host machine running over here
the ip address of which is
192.168.29 179.
if i try to ping this from here
as you can see the time to complete the
request is drastically low compared to a
website on the internet considering this
is on the local network this is how the
ping command is worked and it can show
you what kind of packages are
transmitted how many are received if
there was any kind of packet loss
between the connection window and other
details
a very important command when working
with the terminal for a long duration is
the history command
pretty self-explanatory there are so
many commands that are being run
sometimes people forget what was the
change they did or
what was the directory name they put a
history command helps to recover some of
the commands that we have written it
doesn't go all the way back but it takes
up many commands that were inputted in
the last few processes
this is how the history command works
these are some of the most commonly used
terminal commands if you want to learn
more about this terminal and every other
feature of this please let us know in
the comments section and we will try to
make an in-depth tutorial special if you
could
repeat if you want to learn more about
the terminal please let us know in the
comment section and we will try to make
an in-depth tutorial specifically for
terminal commands on linux
moving on we learn how to configure
proxy chains on our system
proxying refers to the technique of
bouncing your internet traffic through
multiple machines to hide the identity
of the original machine it is a good
tool that hackers use to accomplish this
goal is proxychains
essentially you can use proxychains to
run any program to a proxy server
this will allow you to access internet
from behind a restrictive firewall which
hides your ip address
proxies even allows you to use multiple
proxies at once by chaining them
together
one of the most important reasons that
proxy chains is used in a security
context is that it's easy to evade
detection
attackers often use proxies to hide
their true identities while executing an
attack
and when multiple proxies are chained
together it becomes harder and harder
for forensic professional to trace the
traffic back to the original machine
when these proxies are located across
countries investigators would have to
obtain warranties in the local
jurisdictions where every proxy is
located
to see how proxychain works
let's open firefox first and check our
current ip address
write firefox
and there we go
as we can see firefox is now open
let's check our current ip address right
now
if we go to an address called my
ip.com
and you can see the easily detects our
country is in india and this is a public
ip address
now
if we move to the terminal again
here we can now write
proxy chains
minus h
what this minus h does is it finds a
help it it stands for the help file
this is for help file
what we found out using this is
proxychains has a config file here
etc proxychains4.conf
this is the config file found
using this config file we can customize
how our proxy change should work
if we want to open that we have to use
it in a text editor on windows we have
notepad and other things like that
microsoft word to edit documents on
linux we have a tool called nano to
access the nano we use the command nano
and give the path of the file that we
want to check as of right now the proxy
change config file is located over here
so we're going to follow the path there
chains 4
dot co f
and here we go we see the config file
there are three basic types of proxy
chaining here
we have a strict chain where all the
proxy in the list will be used and they
will be chained in order
we have a random chain where each
connection made through proxy chains
will be done by a random combo of
proxies in the proxy list
and your dynamic chain
it's the same as strict chain but dead
proxies are excluded from the chain
and
here we can set up whichever type we
want
to enable or disable a particular type
we use the hash symbol here as you can
see right now all the lines have a
hashtag symbol at the front except this
one a dynamic chain
this is the current one being used let's
say if i want to use a strict chain
method so i can add a hash value here
and remove the hash here at one point of
time
any one of these three four types should
be enabled
let's go for the
dynam um dynamic chain
we can disable this trick chain by
putting the hashtag in front
and removing the dynamic chain
as you can see below we have few
commands to how to handle the nano text
editor
this symbol
is known as the control button on your
keyboard now if we want to write out
which is synonymous to saving the file
supposed to go with control o so if i
press ctrl o on my keyboard it says file
name to write and we have to press enter
here since we want to overwrite the
proxychains4.conf file we don't want to
create a new file over here so just
press enter
and we get a permission right this
permission denied we're getting is
because we have opened this
using a standard user etc is a system
folder to be able to use make some
changes we have to use it using a pseudo
command
to exit this nano we have to use the
control x command we use control x
we're going to clear
and this time we're going to use the
sudo command
sudo nano
etc
proxy chains
4 dots conf
and we have the same file open up again
now this time if you want to make a
change let's say we're going to add a
strict chain instead of a dynamic chain
which remove the hashtag from straight
we're going to use ctrl o for the save
file option we're going to press enter
and it says root 160 lines
again if you want to reverse this change
we put the hashtag over here
enable dynamic chain
we press ctrl o
press enter and it says root 160 lines
now we can exit straight away using the
control x format
right now we have not provided any file
or a proxy chain we can have proxy ip
addresses from the internet but we have
to make sure that they are safe and they
don't snoop on our data
when there is no proxy change being
provided personally
it going it's going to use the tor
network but for that we have to start
talk
tor is a service in linux
to know more about the store we can
write sudo systemctl which is used to
know the status of services on the linux
operating system
and status of tor
uh system ctl sorry
as instead of stl it should be system
ctl status tor as you can see it is a
toss service anonymizing overlay network
for tcp connections and it's currently
inactive now to start this up
we have to write sudo
systemctl start
talk
now if we repeat the same sudo systemctl
status store
as you can see it's active now
you can see the green logo over here
okay
to integrate the firefox and the browser
we can use the proxychains command
directly over here we can write
proxychains we can use firefox to launch
our web browser and let's say if we want
to visit google.com
we press enter
and the firefox window is launched
and it should open up google.com next
and there we go
if we go to
myip.com once again
as you can see we have a different ip
address
and the country is unknown as well
so this is how we can use proxy chains
to anonymize
internet usage when using kali linux
next on an agenda is the ability to scan
networks using nmap
at its core nmap is a network scanning
tool that uses ip packets to identify
all the devices connected to a network
can learn more about nmap using the help
file
as you can see these are some of the
parameters that can be used when
scanning ports of a system you can see
the version and the url of the webs of
the service
over here
the primary uses of nmap can be broken
into three core processes first the
program gives you detailed information
on every ip active on your network and
then each ipa can then be scanned
secondly it can also be used to
providing a lot of live hosts and open
ports as well as identifying the os of
every connected device
thirdly
nmap has also become a valuable tool for
users looking to protect personal and
business websites
using nmap to scan your own web server
particularly if you are hosting your
website from home is essentially
simulating the process that a hacker
would use to attack your site
attacking your own site in this way is a
powerful way of identifying security
vulnerabilities
as we already discussed the host windows
10 machine on the system has an ip
address a 192 168 29.179
if you want to test the os scan of the
system we're going to first get the root
permission over here
we use the sudo command and now we are a
root user we're going to launch the
command
nmap minus o which is supposed to be an
os detection scan
the ip address we can use of the host
system
192.168.29.179
in a legitimate penetration testing
scenario we can use the ip address of
the vulnerable device over here
we are going to let it scan for a while
and it's going to give us some guesses
on what can the os be
as you can see the scan is done
and it has shown some of the ports that
are open
you can see the msrpc port open at the
https 443 port open which is used to
connect to the internet
and it has some aggressive os guesses as
well for example it thinks there's a 90
94 chance that it's going to be a
microsoft windows xp service pack 3.
that's partly because a lot of the
windows xp update packages are still
prevalent on windows
now that the os detection is confirmed
there are multiple more
details that we can gather from nmap
let's go with the nmap minus a command
which is supposed to capture as much
data as possible
there is also a speed setting
you can call it a speed setting or a
control setting
of the minus t
minus t ranges from t 0 to t1 to t2 all
the way up to d5
this basically determines how
aggressively the victim is being scanned
if you scan slowly it will take more
time to provide the results but it will
also give a less chance for intrusion
detection system on the vulnerable
machine firewall to detect that someone
is trying to penetrate the network for
now if we want to go with somewhat of a
high speed we can go with the t4 and
provide the same ip address of the local
machine i am trying to attack
it's going to take a little bit of time
since it's trying to capture a lot of
information
as you can see the results are now
here
it launched a scan and took a few top
ports that are most likely vulnerable
from a windows xp perspective and it
showed
a few ports over here it has not shown
991 filtered ports which could not be
attacked anyway since they were closed
for outside access it shows a few
fingerprint settings like the connection
policies and the
port details
it shows an http options some other
intricate details that can be used when
you attacking its servers
it shows a vmware version that it's
running
and some few other ports over here
apart from that we also have the
aggressive os guesses over here just
like we did with the minus o and you can
see this time it is showing windows 7 as
98 percent
no exact os matches since uh if there
was any exact voice matches we could
have seen a hundred percent chances over
here
this is a trace route a trace route will
be the time and the path a connection
request takes from the source to the
destination for example this request
went from 19168.72.2
to a destination address since this is a
local machine it took only
a single step on multiple occasions if
you're trying to access a remote system
it's going to be a number of tray suits
when it jumps from firewall to firewall
and router to router
this is how we can use nmap to find
information about a system and find some
vulnerable ports we can access
moving on we have a tutorial on how to
use wireshark to sniff network traffic
to start using wireshark we're going to
have to
open the application first
now during installation of wireshark
there is an option to enable if non-root
users can be able to capture traffic or
not
in my installation i have disabled that
so i will be launching wireshark when
using the root user itself
also to capture data we need an external
wi-fi adapter
you can see it over here
in the vm tab removable devices
re-link 802.1 and wlan
this is an external wi-fi adapter which
is inserted into my usb system
you can see it over here if i write iw
config
this is the one wlan 0 this is
absolutely necessary because we need to
have a monitor mode
required we won't need it for sniffing
data on wireshark
right now but it's going to be necessary
later on in this tutorial as well as we
will see
for now we can just start up via shark
by writing its name on the command line
and it should start the program
here we go
here it's going to check which of the
adapters we want to use for example
right now the eth0 which is supposed to
stand for ethernet 0 port you can see
data is being transmitted up and down
we're going to select eth0
and we have started capturing data
you can see this
data requests from the source to
destination and the time and the which
protocol it is following everything we
can see and we can see the ipv4 flags
here as well
as you can see over here
to capture internet traffic
we can try running firefox
if we just write wikipedia.com
and you can see the number of requests
increasing
okay this is spelling mistake wikipedia
here
you can see the application data of all
these requests going up
and they're connected to a destination
server of
1010 to 166.2
now if we even if we check the
transmission control protocol flags over
here and so many more things
we cannot find anything beneficial as
you can see the information over here is
gibberish which is supposed to be since
it's supposed to be encrypted
now
this is possible due to this being an
https website hence you can see the lock
symbol over here and connection is
supposed to be secure
now what about http ports we have seen
many people recommend to not visit http
ports
repeat
we have seen many people recommend to
not visit http websites and even if we
have to visit to not provide any
critical information
for example let's go to a random
http page over here
as you can see this is
saying connection is not secure and this
is an http http page and not https
now let's check for some of the
information that is passing through this
this is a login form
let's say i have a legitimate account
over here
if i write my account name
and my password is supposed to be
password one two three four
i press login
and uh the password does not match
because i do not have an account over
here but let's say i did and i was
logged in as expected we can go to
wireshark
we can use filters over here now all the
requests that i'm sending it's a tcp
request so i can write a filter
containing tcp
contains
whatever string if it is being passed
let's say for the end username i write
my account name
so i can just write my account name over
here
and press enter
to find a request over here now as you
can see
there are many flags over here
if we go to the http html form url
encoded and open up some of its flags
as you can see i can see my account name
and simply learn password over here this
is the same
details that i input on the website
let's say i did have a legitimate
account on this website i would have
logged in with no problems but anyone
who would be using wireshark to sniff on
the data can easily get my credentials
from here
this is why it's recommended to not
provide any information on http pages
the security is not up to the mark and
always look for the lock symbol when
visiting any website or
making any internet transactions or
providing any information
this is how we can use wireshark to
detect transmission and sniff packet
data that is being transferred to the
network adapter
next we have to learn about what is
metasploit
the metasploit project is a computer
security project that provides
information about security
vulnerabilities and aids in penetration
testing and ids development
we can open up the terminal here we're
going to allow root access
and to open up metasploit the keyword is
msf console
it's going to take a little bit of time
to start it up
now the metasploit console has been
loaded
from here we can decide what type of
attack we want to launch and what kind
of exploits we can launch against
vulnerable targets
for example like we already discussed
i'm running this virtual machine on a
windows 10 host machine so if i open the
command prompt from my windows 10 over
here
if i need to check the ip address once i
go with ipconfig
here you can see the ip address of this
local machine
moving on
if we have to attack that machine let's
say we want to see what kind of exploits
are going to work over there
now we already know that windows has
some common vulnerabilities one of those
vulnerabilities is the hta server
vulnerability hta is supposed to be a
html application but when past the right
payload it can be used to open a back
door into a system
to start off with the metasploit and
accessing such applications
we're going to use the command
use exploit and the name of the reverse
hta server is this windows
misc for miscellaneous
hda
server
as you can see it already found this one
all right
now
there are some options that we need to
set for this exploit to go through for
example you can see some of the options
over here
there is a payload the payload is
supposed to be the malicious file that
we are going to send on the html
application which allows us to give the
back door
for example right now the payload which
is the malicious file is a windows meet
operator reverse tcp
completely understandable now let's set
the l host
l host and r host and srv host should be
the one
where we are going to launch the attack
from for example
if we launched another tab of this
console
and we just press i f config
the ip address is 192.168.72
130
so we're going to set the lhost as
192.168.72
0.130
and we're going to do the same thing
with srv host
we're going to set a port
where we need to capture the backdoor
access
next
the payload has already been set
this payload will launch a backdoor and
give us meter printer access to the
system
meterpreter is can be considered as an
upgrade of a normal command prompt shell
we will look into it once we get the
access in the first place
now that we have set the commands
we can press on exploit and press enter
now
you can see we have a url over here
we're going to copy this url
once the url is copied we take it into
the browser
and paste it
this will ask us to download this file
now as per browser security settings
this file should be blocked by default
we can decide to keep it and with the
correct formulation of this malicious
package even the website browser
antivirus softwares will not be able to
detect good payloads we're going to save
this file
and we're going to open it
publisher could not be verified if we
press run
and we go back
to our peter access over here
you can see it has already captured a
url fnhd server and it is writing
delivering payload
just have to wait for a few seconds so
the payload is delivered
it has sent
this much amount of data meterpreter
session one is opened
and we should get the access soon
there we go
now
to understand where is the session set
we can write sessions minus i
as you can see it has a metadata over
here we're going to write
sessions minus i
the session id is one so we're going to
write one
and we have the meterpreter access now
to get a fair idea of the system
we're going to write sysinfo and it's
going to the computer name the os
architecture all these things we can
write the help command to see what are
the things that we can get out of the
system we can take screenshots we can
control the webcam and start a video
chat
we can take a lot of things over here
there are other commands as well where
we can change the file directory like
the cat command cd command there are so
many things that work in the normal cmd
which we can run on the meter beta as
well now if you want to access this
command prompt of the system directly
we can go with this
we have to write shell
and there we go we are in the downloads
folder right now to see if this is the
same computer or not we're going to
write ipconfig
as you can see it is our mesh victim
machine with 192 168 but 29.17
we can just press exit
and we're back with the meterpreter
access
this is how we can use meterpreter and
metasploit to gain access to a windows
10 machine
next let's take a look at how we can get
root access from a windows 10 system
we just learned how we can get a meter
beta access from a system
we can background this meter predator
session by writing background and
pressing enter
we can still we can still see the shares
session is minus i
it's still present over here
now
these kind of access are not
administrative access
these are the kind of back doors that
can be created for standard users but to
get a complete access of a system
including the program files the windows
documents we need to have root access or
administrative access
to that we're going to use another
exploit reminder that the meter peter
session of the standard axis is already
present and we're not messing with it
right now we're going to set up another
session
albeit with the same machine
that exploit name is
use exploit windows
local
bypass uac
event
viewer and there we go
now if we check the options that we can
put in the system
we have to choose an exploit target
we need to put a session as well
let's say we going to use the session
one this is the session that has the
metadata access with the standard user
it doesn't have the system user
we're going to write
set session one
and we're going to run exploit run a few
commands and it opened a second
meterpreter session
as you can see it is the session 2.
if i write this info
you can still see i'm not the
system user right now i'm still
just
a normal user how can we check that
if we go to shell
it still sees the user generally
downloads all these things
if i press exit
and go back to the meter button there is
a command on meter peter
get system it attempts to elevate your
privilege to that of the local system
which basically means you get promoted
into root access so if we write get
system
and due to pipe impersonation we now
have the system root access
as you can see now it has become x64 and
we are the admin users now if i go to
shell
i can easily go back
windows
and i can easily access these things
this kind of control over the windows
folders and the
program files folders these kind of
things are not possible if you are not
an admin access or the command prompt
has not been run with admin permissions
this is how we can use privilege
escalation to get into an admin access
system
we use the second
exploit which was the bypass us event
viewer exploit and essentially used it
with the first session
as you can read here windows escalation
usb protection bypass
it was first disclosed on 2016 but it
still works on some systems
this is how we can get a root access on
a windows 10 installation
hope you learned something new today if
you have any doubts regarding the topic
mentioned in the lesson
