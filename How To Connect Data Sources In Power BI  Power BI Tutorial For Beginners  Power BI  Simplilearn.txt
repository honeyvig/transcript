hello and welcome to this session on how
to connect different data sources with
power bi so in this session today we
will see how can you connect different
type of data types data sets like Excel
PDF CSV Etc to import in power bi for
your data visualization needs so what's
in it for us today we will be learning
how to connect to data different data
types data files like Excel PDF then
what are the different data importing
modes and then I will also show you
practically different sets how to import
them in power bi and use it for your
visualization purpose now what are the
steps to connect to data so now we will
go directly into Power bi and try to
import one by one few most commonly and
popularly used data sets which are most
commonly used in a day-to-day activity
rest of course there are are the power
bi supports n number of data sources but
we will do something practical on the
most popular ones so let's let's open
our power bi
now this is my power bi and first I want
to show you that how can I import data
directly from a web page and import the
data now it is asking for a URL in order
to import data
so what I have done is I have created a
Google Excel sheet with simple data with
rows and columns and what I have done is
I have shared this sheet as published to
web
okay so you just need to say publish to
the web the link as web page and
say done it's it's automatically
published and say link so copy the link
which you have published on the web copy
this link
and then go back to your tableau
paste that link over here and click ok
Now power bi will try to establish a
connection with this Google doc sheet
because it's published on the web
foreign
you need to wait for a while while it is
reading
okay now it has read one of the HTML
tables I'll select this one now you can
see it has it is showing me a preview of
the table which is there on my
Google sheet right it has 11 rows so it
has all showed all the 11 rows so now I
can go and transform this data because I
can see my headers are there starting
from the second row so there is an
opportunity for me to transform the data
so I'll go and transform it so that it
looks clean
okay so first is I need to remove the
first row which is the
null row remove the top rows
okay and then I need to use the first
row now as a header so you just click
this option use first row as headers
that's it so now if you see my row ID
order ID order date shifted all my data
is now ready so I can say close and
apply
click apply changes
now this is an example of web data
import you can go and preview your data
right now the biggest advantage of this
data connection is that it's a live data
so for example I insert another row
let me change the order ID
some some I've Subs changed some basic
stuff and I
it's Auto saved
Ctrl s now I'll go to my tableau and
I'll refresh
now you can see as I refreshed my
power query editor I click refresh all
and I got my new row which is there in
the live data I got that fetched from my
okay I got that row the row number ID
number 12 so I have to say close and
apply
now you can see the new row the row
number 12 is now available in my new
data set in the data set because it's a
live connection it's a live connection
with the web based Google sheet okay so
this is one important way in which you
can import data
now let's try to import data from a text
file
now I have already prepared our text
file called
sub categories Dot txt
now let me just open it in a notepad now
it's a very plain simple file tab
separated file in which you have product
subcategory ID subcategory name and
product category key so basically to
which product category this particular
sub product belongs to right so what I'm
going to do is I'm gonna go back to my
get data option
and I'm gonna select text slash CSV
option
and I'm gonna select option mod product
subcategories.txt
okay so now power bi has identified that
it's a tab delimited file it has
recognized the headers
Etc right and I can now directly load
this file
okay so now once the data is imported in
power bi it is like
irrelevant to me it's a composite data
in import I'm doing right so in my
presentation when I'm talking about
importing data there are different
importing modes right import our data
import can happen through different ways
okay
one is direct query mode in which I
create a live connection to the database
which I'll also show you uh using MySQL
and Ms SQL server and also you can do a
composite mode in which you can have
data imported from Excel plus you can
have direct query modes so you can have
multiple uh modes to connect and create
a composite data model and that's what
we are doing right now in our practical
so what we are doing over here is one we
have imported data from the web second
we have imported data from a text table
now after doing text now our next task
is to import from CSV let's try another
one so now I have imported product
subcategory
now I'll import
a CSV file so again I'll choose the
option Text slash CSV and now in this
CSV file let me open this CSV file and
show you what it is it
so this is a list of all my products
product key product sub category Key
Products uh stock keeping unit Etc a
simple CSV file and I'm gonna import
that
okay so now it is identified the
delimiter is comma rather than a tab and
it has already recognized the headers
correctly so I load it
okay so now my products are there
product subcategories are there for
product categories now what I have done
is I have created as Excel mode now so
now Excel I am using to import my
product category
so now I have to click on the option of
import data from Excel and I'll say
product categories
select the sheet load
and now so my products product
categories product subcategories do with
different uh data storage types but
still now the data is imported into
Power bi is a composite data model now
another very important data type which
you can import is the PDF also right so
what I have done is I have created a PDF
called customers my customers data is
lying in a PDF so what I've done is I've
created a PDF
which has data for some columns are
there like you know customer key prefix
first name last name birthdate marital
status gender email address annual
income total children etc etc so this is
the data set
which I have created in PDF so what I'm
gonna do is
I'm going to select PDF now
and import customers.pdf and see it has
recognized my table on page one which
I'm gonna load
okay
you can rename this as PDF
table
so this basically these are the
different type of
data
types we have imported PDF Excel text
CSV and web page
now let's take a look at another
interesting data set which you want to
import is the my SQL Server data set
so what I have done is I've already
installed MySQL server on my local
instance and there's already a schema of
SQL live tutorial over there and I have
certain tables already
prepared over there like Department
employee Etc so my goal is now to import
this data or create a live connection
with this data set
now in order to import
my SQL database Connection in power bi
you need to First
download a
connector MySQL power bi connector so
you need to go to this link
and then click on download and install
the MySQL connector based on the
operating system you have you click on
download and install it
after you have done this go back to
Power bi
and then give
the IP address of the database in my
case it's there in this local machine
and the schema which I want to import is
SQL live tutorial so I'll give the name
click connect
okay now it's connected so now it is
asking me which particular tables you
want to create a connection with I am
choosing department and employee
and I'm just loading them
okay so now this is the exact data which
is there in the employee and Department
in MySQL okay so this is one example of
how to create connectivity between power
bi and MySQL
now I want to do the same thing using
SQL Server Microsoft SQL Server so I
have also installed Microsoft SQL server
on my machine
and I have used the SQL Express so this
is the name of my server so which I'll
copy the server name
and
go to get data
select SQL Server
and for now database is optional I can
say direct query click ok
okay now it is showing me what all
tables I can import so in my SQL Server
tutorial
in my SQL Server I have
I have these three tables customers
employee tuition Olympic events so I can
use probably the customers one which is
now you can see this is the data the
customer's data which is lying in my SQL
Server okay so I can preview it and load
it
so now you can you can preview the data
in uh
power bi that is this is the data so I
can rename his customers from
mssql
and this is from
my sequel
and
okay so now
this is not the only data
sets you can import now if you take a
look at the options which power bi gave
what different type and variations of
data it can it has compatibility to
import from
foreign
okay so we can just take a look at the
categorization on the left hand side
first there are five ways like Excel
text XML Json is also possible you can
evenly directly import entire folder and
within the folder whatever uh data types
of files are there it will detect it PDF
power key or even SharePoint folder
which is itself a Microsoft uh
technology then different kind of
databases SQL server and MySQL we just
saw but it's not only limited to this
you can connect to Microsoft Access
ssas Oracle database IBM db2 postgres
SCI base teradata and then sap
databases Amazon redshift Impala vertica
Snowflake and N number of databases
which are there in the market today
Amazon
Etc
then it also allows you to connect with
its own power platforms power bi
platforms data mods power bi data flows
dataverse Etc Azure there are different
kind of storage
mechanisms in Azure and Azure itself is
a Microsoft Technology so it has a
compatibility of a lot of azure uh based
data storages like Azure SQL database
blob storage uh Azure data breaks right
Azure HD insights path so if you have
those kind of services running on your
observed cloud services you can even
import them over here
now online services like you know you
have erps running uh or some data which
is shared on the internet if you want to
import it uh that is also possible
through certain products uh Dynamics 365
Microsoft Exchange online Salesforce
Google analytics Adobe analytics GitHub
LinkedIn sales if you want to do some
analysis of some social networking uh
you know feeds that also you can import
then other miscellaneous are also their
web-based hive R script python script if
there's something to import get data
from uh Google Sheets like we store one
example in our video right now so there
are multiple options available
now once you have imported the data
which is relevant to you
um in hours of sequence sessions we will
see how to create relationships but just
giving you a glimpse that whatever data
you are importing power bi Auto detects
certain relationships and it will create
for you but then you can go and manually
also change so this is the composite
data model which is getting created in
the back end while you are importing the
data you can easily go and manage these
relationships either keep them as is you
can delete and create new ones manually
so there is no limitation in that
so this is what we have witnessed we
have imported data from different files
types data types and then you know we
have tried once it is imported into uh
Power bi then there is no limitation of
how you use it you can create
visualization across different data sets
and then create your
standard reports
so this is the example of importing data
from web importing data from a database
from a PDF
and then once you have data you can
shape and combine data you can basically
do whatever whatever transformation you
want to do you want to uh make joins
merge the data so for example if we go
back to our power bi and if I go back to
my transform data section
now as I have now different data sets
available with me I have I can do any
kind of uh you know operation
transformation on the data right uh
so like I showed you I uh upgraded the
header row because one of the imported
data was not showing the header
correctly uh or this columns like this
exact one column is extra I can remove
the column
right all those Transformations whatever
I do in the back end gets captured in
the applied steps section right
this is the customer data you can create
uh you can merge it you can append it uh
you know with other data sets right
let's for example I want to create a
merge data set of my categories and
subcategories so I can say mer selectors
two data sets and say merge queries as
new
and
I can select product categories and
products are categories select
product category key on both the sides
and then they do a left Auto join so
whatever product categories are there
I'll get the subcategories associated
with it and I'll create a new
table
which will have
now I have the table which has the
category and the subcategory and
subcategory in one table itself so I can
rename it now to as
category
sub category
table it's a it's a merge basically it's
a join between category and subcategory
now I have a common table right and I
can close and apply
so imagine I have created a new table
which is imported created from one data
set is which is Excel page another data
set which is text based
see this category subcategory table so
now I can use it
the way I want in my visualization
reports so that's what the presentation
says right that once you have uh the
imported data you can shape you can
combine you can adjust you can do
whatever transformation you want to do
and create your visualization okay I
hope you guys had a great learning
session in this and I'll see you in my
next session
