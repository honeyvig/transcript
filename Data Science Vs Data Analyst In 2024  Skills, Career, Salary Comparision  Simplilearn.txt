hey everyone welcome to this video by
simply n today I've got a question for
you what's the difference between a data
analyst and a data scientist well in
this video we will give you the answers
from Healthcare to ride healing apps and
online shopping to streaming services
big data has transformed applications
and how we interact with them two key
Fields underpinning this transformation
are data science and data analytics
now I know these Concepts can be a bit
tricky to grasp at first so let's use a
fun analogy to make it more clearer
imagine for a moment that a business is
like a human body in this scenario a
data scientist would be a general
practitioner while a data analyst would
be more like a specialist consultant
both play crucial roles in keeping the
body or in our case the business healthy
and functioning well think of the data
scientist as the GP who looks at at the
entire body they need to understand how
all the different parts work together
and how external factors affect overall
health this big picture of views allows
them to ask important questions about
the body's well-being that others might
miss on the other hand the data analyst
is like a specialist focusing on a
specific part of the body let's say the
heart or the brain they dive deep into
the area of expertise answering specific
questions and solving particular
particular problems for example if
there's an issue with the heart the data
analyst or heart specialist would be the
goto expert but remember while the
specialist focuses on the area the GP
will still keep an eye on the overall
health they work together each bringing
the unique skills and keeping the body
or the business in top shape so in a
nutshell data scientist and data analyst
both play Vital roles in keeping a
business healthy the data scientist
looks at the bigger picture while the
data analyst Dives deep into specific
areas throughout this video we will
explore these roles in a more detail
looking at the specific task skills they
need and how they contribute to the data
driven world we live in craving a career

started so let's discuss the differences
between data analytics and data science
imagine a thriving social media app with
millions of users sharing photos videos
and messages every day at this company
we have two data Heroes Alex the data
analyst and Chris the data scientist
they both work with data but their roles
are quite different Alex is like the
apps detective their job is to figure
out on how many people are using the app
right now Alex looks at two things
firstly which features are most popular
when do most people log in and how long
do users spend on this app Alex digs
through user activity logs engagement
metrics and customer feedback to answer
specific questions this helps the team
make the app better today that's what
data analysts do they solve current
puzzles using existing information now
Chris they're more like the apps fortune
teller and inventor rolled into one
Chris takes all the data Alex collects
put a whole lot and more and tries to
predict the future they ask big
questions like what new Futures will
users want next year how can we use AI
to make the app more fun what if we
could predict trending topics before
they explored Chris uses complex
mathematics machine learning and
computer programming to sport Trends and
create new ideas that's what data
scientists do they use data to predict
the future and innovate both Alex and
Chris are crucial for the app success
Alex helps the app run smoothly and
keeps user happy day-to-day Chris helps
the company plan for the future and stay
ahead in the competitive Tech world
let's look at the key definitions of how
they differ from each other comparing
data science versus data analytics data
science and data analytics well related
serve testing purposes data science is a
broad multidisciplinary field
encompassing areas like machine learning
artificial intelligence and computer
science it involves researching vast
amounts of unstructured data to ask and
answer strategic long-term questions
data scientists often build complex
models and algorithm focusing on
Innovation and strategic decision making
and they usually hold senior roles in
contrast data analytics is a special
discipline with data science that
focuses on analyzing existing structur
data to answer specific and immediate
questions data analysts interpret data
identify Trends and provide actionable
insights using tools like SQL and Excel
they often work in specific departments
like marketing and sales while their
skill set is narrower than the data
scientist they have a deep understanding
of the particular businesses area
essentially data scientists create a big
picture framework while data analysts
zoom in specific elements within that
framework to optimize current
operation let's talk about the skill set
comparison skills for data analyst
Proficiency in business intelligence
tools strong statistical analytical
skills intermediate programming skills
in SQL and python expertise in data
visualization tools like Tab and powerbi
next let's discuss the skills for data
scientists to be a data scientist you
must know Advanced knowledge of machine
learning and AI you must have experience
with big data platform such as Hadoop
and Apache spark strong programming
skills in Python and R proficience in
predictive modeling and data mining
techniques let's discuss the workflow
comparison now let's compare the
workflows of data analyst and data
scientist the workflow of data analyst
typically begins with data collection
where they gather data from various
sources to ensure they have all the
necessary information next comes data
cleaning a crucial step where they
remove any errors and renes from the
data set to ensure accuracy following
this they perform data analyst using
statistical methods to interpret the
data and uncover patterns and Trends to
present their findings effectively data
analyst then engage in data
visualization creating charts and graph
that make complex data more
understandable finally they provide
actionable insights offering
recommendations that can be implemented
immediately to improve business
operations in contrast the workflow of a
data scientist starts with identifying
the problem where they Define a
strategic question or opportunity that
needs to be addressed then they proceed
with data mining extracting relevant
data from large data sets to gather the
information needed for the analysis
similar to data analyst data scientist
also perform data cleaning to prepare
the data for analysis however they take
it a step further with data exploration
conducting exploratory analysis to
understand the depth of data next we
have feature engineering where they
create new features from raw data to
enhance the models and then they build
predictive models to forecast future
outcomes based on the data once the
models are ready they deploy the model
into production and start generating ins
ites in real time the final step is the
workflow to Monitor and iterate
continuously improving the model based
on the new data and ensure it remains
accurate and effective let's discuss the
tools and techniques let's explore the
tools and techniques used by data
analyst and data scientist data analyst
like Alex uses a variety of tools to
handle and analyze data efficiently they
often use Excel for data organization
and basic analysis due to their
accessibility and functionality for
quiring databases SQL is the go-to
language enabling them to extract and
manipulate data effectively to visualize
data and create insightful dashboards
tab is commonly employed using robust
data visualization capabilities
additionally python is used for more
Advanced Data manipulation and Analysis
making it a versatile tool in data
analyst toolkit on the other hand data
scientists like Chris rely on slightly
different set of tools to handle their
more complex task python is a staple for
data manipulation machine learning and
artificial intelligence thanks to the
extensive libraries and Frameworks R is
also a key tool for particularly for
statistical analysis and visualization
providing powerful statistical
techniques for processing large data
sets hard hoop is indispensable enabling
scalable and distributed computing
Apache spark is used for large scale
data processing offering speed and ease
of use for big data analytics lastly we
have the tensor flow which is important
for building and deploying machine
learning models making it essential for
AI related task let's discuss the
application comparison let's see how the
work of data analyst and data scientists
relies in real world scenarios data
analysts like Alex plays a vital role in
understanding user behavior for example
they analyze which app features are most
popular among users providing insights
that can enhance user experience and
apps functionality in the realm of sales
they identifi Trends and optimize
marketing strategies ensuring that the
company targets its audience effectively
and maximizes revenue moreover by
analyzing customer feedback data
analysts help improve product features
ensuring the company meets customer
needs and expectations conversely data
scientists like Chris engage in more
productive and Innovative application
they use predictive analysis to forecast
future Trends and behaviors allowing
companies to make informed strategic
decisions for instance they build
recommendation systems that suggest
products or contents to users based on
their past Behavior enhancing user
engagement and satisfaction additionally
they develop AI Innovations to improve
user experience such as chat boards or
personalized user interfaces leveraging
Advanced machine learning models to stay
ahead in the comp competitive Tech
