foreign
and
in this video we will be creating a
clone of Facebook but before we begin if
you haven't subscribed to our Channel
already make sure to hit the Subscribe
button and press the Bell icon so you
will never miss any update from Simply
learn
so without further Ado let's begin and
see what's in it for you so let me show
you
how a app will look like
here we are going to create a Facebook
clone with react.js
but before we jump to the coding part
let me show you how our Facebook login
page looks like
so we're gonna go to the Google
and this is how our Facebook loan will
look like
you can also log in from here
in this here
you have to write your email address
like my email address is
and I'll write the password and password
I can write
and then
here I'll click on the login
it will ask me to say and never and this
is how I will login page main page will
look like
here you can add your status
this is your login your search bar
and here you can also add the status
and this is how you can upload a picture
so
we can easily create this clone
follow me throughout this video and you
will learn how to create a Facebook loan
so without further Ado let's create this
Facebook loan from scratch with a fun
manner
but first let me tell you what react.js
is
so what is react.js react is a
JavaScript library that is used to build
mobile and web applications fast and
interactive it is an open source
reusable component based front-end
library of JavaScript react is a
combination of HTML and JavaScript
it provides a reverse and opinionated
way to build modern applications
so now
let's create this folder
back to our Visual Studio code
for this
you have to install node.js in your
laptop
and
react yes you can also
get our videos
just type how to install node.js and
react.js on your system on our Channel
you'll get plenty of videos of this
so we'll go and create
new folder
let's
minimize this
say this
will open our terminal
press Ctrl backtick
or you can also
go here
and press terminal and new terminal okay
now
you have opened our terminal
here
you have to create a react project
so for that
we'll write a command
let's just delete this
everything's look fine
in this video I will also show you how
to create a shortcut and you can use
which are used by the Developers
Now to create an empty react project the
command is
npx
create
react
app
and then
the folder name
so I'm gonna write the folder name as
Facebook
clone
doubly because I have already created
Facebook clone with single e so I'm
gonna write clone press enter
this will take couple of minutes to
install all the modules so let's wait a
for few seconds till it's finished
let's wait a couple of minutes more
so let's
cut this
okay maybe I have to log this out
as you can see it's installing all the
modules of the app
like the add react Dom VR script
moving forward we will also install the
ACT modules like
in the yard
okay right let's talk about that further
in this tutorial
now we'll go into the
clone
now we'll write in VM start
and this will open up the ad project
so the first step is done here now
coming back to our code
let's open this folder
my folder is inside this
C drive so I'm going to go to this
there
users
and this is my folder as you can see
I've already created this little clue
so
this is how
you are folder will look like
inside the source folder you will have
this
app.js you don't need this logo
so we're gonna delete this
we'll show some error let's see
coming back to index.js
let me do very few things here also
but before that let me add one file here
a couple of seconds
you can add that further in this
tutorial also
hello
we will remove this logo from here
instead of this it will import
react
well you don't need this header also
here and right
hello
from
simply done
let's open Terminal
inside this Facebook loan you have
already in this code so you won't have
to tell you a CD let's zoom in for you
guys
this is fine
so it's showing hello from singular
add to a cone now
let's not waste any time and build our
Facebook load up
now let's create a folder here
as login page
inside this folder we're going to create
two files login page node.js
and
login
page dot CSS
inside this GS file we're going to write
all our code and inside this we are
going to do all our saving part
to coming back to our locking page we're
going to first import react
after input is react
we need to import the CSS file for this
login
okay
okay fine
now
we'll create a function
of your login page
inside this function
in the create one
fifth class
of login
inside this we're going to create
another class
name let's name it Facebook
create another class of Facebook text
so these are the keywords that we are
going to use in our CSS file
so let's hit add Facebook
and here will export r
s login page
let's save this
code let's delete this part
and then we'll delete
the login page
let's call it Insider approaches
okay
let's find the problem here
okay problem is here
do not install or import our file like
this
let's now save it and you can see
it's free
coming back to our app dot CSS
here we go this so we're gonna delete
and save this one is from this part
okay
now
going back to our index.js
now we cannot see the Facebook
written in yours um
so let's just see what's speech okay
come on
now let's save this as you can see the
Facebook is written
now let's move forward with our code
let's create this one
let's create another
class name
let me say this we're gonna write before
that let me log into my Facebook account
to see
what are we going to create
as you can see we are going to create
this
let's copy this text
let me paste it here
and as you can see it's break after
share
you're fine fine
coming back to a code let's see
Facebook with after one
that's
move forward
after this
let's create a
class name of container
so we're going to create this argument
but this is finished I'm gonna just
create this one you can study this color
and everything you never see this is
a code
let's name this as you know how to
container
class
last night
okay we're gonna add
two login inputs one for this email and
password
so let's
fill it up for a second word
thank you thank you
email
so react is a very intelligent language
there we are going to write emails with
just automatically knows that where you
have to write the email ID and then set
this password and I'll give it a type
password
it automatically knows it's a password
type
so let's
hold here in this placeholder
let's click on this
this email address or password
placeholder is nothing but what's being
in the right hand side is it can't be
fixed
so it's for the user
only do it
he
press or
we will explain
this after this let's create
games let's create a video
another
guide
save this
it's time to save this and sleep
good looking good
yes
it's coming back to our code
we are going to style this part it'll
look like this only
so just wait a couple of more minutes to
see the amazing love intention
to creating this we are going to create
a button
but actually it's nice
okay
let's just
delete button
is created or not it's created
okay now
coming back to a gold
see it for your password I think
it's creating Enterprise
oh God
okay and inside this I'm going to give
it back
forget
them
foreign
C8
is just
let's take this
button
we need a lot of experience
[Music]
as you guys
because me as
in this world each other
so that's disabled this poverty
and then save this button right what's
inside this create new account
create account
so now you know like this create a page
or a celebrating plan on business
go to this button
that's pretty good space
also
let's create another class name
I'm going to create another tab
after 38
please
create
foreign
save this and see what's output so
everything looks fine like this only now
the amazing part is the styling part now
we're going to style this part we'll
create it like this isn't it amazing
let's go to our code and inside our
login.css
let's come here
this file is here and
but it's
the first
okay
[Music]
six would be fine
then this part will imply on a full page
so this is a binder
save it
inside this box size
foreign
in this login
reflects all this for this
would be
and in terms
fix it up for that
for Content should be space between him
so isn't it looking fine
let's move forward
you'll get to see everything like this
login page but we are going to create a
full fridge
so just be with me
okay
and let's
project
now
some years were fixed
it's full countries
let's say this let's give the pattern
also
on Save
me let's give it a three now
color
[Music]
to
yes
it will be
let's say this okay
yes
and say it should be six
650 rules
let's give it
listening
it's looking like let's
see
what's 780
created
it's just more forward
we win
it's right right
for this
five
okay
let's say this this
somebody is the size
to move forward
let's see you
I'm starting so
I'm not
those continues
so let's create a login
multi-sensitives
let's see between this we're going to do
so let's give it a reporter of
hate it
bullets
we
will be able to quite a little
spoky friends coming back to him
let's give it
it's too late
[Music]
for me to face
it's where it is
0.7
circus
destruction
we will continue
let's see the issue with the container
Excel
and he shows here
amazing
it's include the size
is like this
things
instructor 2016
what radius
a word
it's
under there
was an email
here
let's give it a bit unrealism
the width will be given inside this
container
so we can jump 100
20 pixels
[Music]
pretty much
thank you
I'm just succeeding
um
yes
what do you think
it's for me but we should
fluency against this
crazy
yeah
just delete this one
and let's
stick to our parents
so
you would imagine now three pixels
same thing should be
memory box now
foreign
also
let's copy this component
paste it here
because what we'll be saying
so
password
and smoke on this please hurry up
input
please hold them
for example this is
let me check that
it's much more
so let's give it completely that's
something fine
yes
now let's work on the button part
with that let's give it a display of
flex
Direction
will be
something like this so it's slow
and width would be
good again
so we will copy this
then
let's squeeze it and save this button
again
and now let's see
isn't it looking amazing
let's go recorder
no
exciting
um
if it is
great
if I could end
up
save it it's coming in the center
General
so I'm going to decide
actually
that's
this I'm standing
and this would be five frame
should be
okay let's give it away
if you get text and decorations no
it's looking
more Lego
Court let's see here
okay everything's looks great
and let's have to see the pattern
for now
can you do
it's very nice you know
you're happy to leave this after few
minutes because
this he was already we are going to
delete this part to login
but let's see this
this can be disabled is like a
literature
a little Slim
just jokes a bit
this is not good
foreign
but then we have to increase
they just says
alignment would have been entered again
display always flicks and I've told you
on this and I will be ready
here at first okay
okay
this
but it would be the same
it's
God damn it
we do
if there's
me
and this looks pretty
straight at this button
it's looking right now
I'm creating this
let's work on this button part
nership
but
it's
Jesus part
of those images in the first
let's just play
fix
and just factored it
Center
is
this
[Music]
this
will be
seven to it
yes
yes
slowly coming like a button
so let's first give it a trading list
it would be 15 pixels and
confidence
in this book
see
this one
foreign
it's difficult
let's move forward
and here you'll give a bit of
off flakes
bold
and what will reach this
25
margin
we have to left of 20 minutes
so save and see the magic
isn't it looking amazing right yeah
so let's
move forward
let's create a page for this let's field
honestly so
we can do
and every color would be
scared
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
size
font size would be
one
after that let's give it a painting of
left
ten percent
[Music]
let's move forward
with sleeping five minutes
okay
exactly
sweet
save this
shouldn't be here
that you've come up to listen but let's
not give it a doctor it's really like
this so let's
hear it
inside there's nothing but details
sounds good
sort of so let's do
add this
to come after this one
yeah looks good now let's change the
color
it's not but it's just
and let's save this
reading the color
so
it's not
like this
it's
infected
extrication is
changes
the color
White
okay
let's hit this button always first
that's now save this
so we are done our
page
excuse me
it's looking amazing it's like this only
changes are needed
but let's not dig deep into this you can
also
have a few things
which looks fine to me so
[Music]
let's Now work on our
domain page open this
let's create a folder
and
Maybe
it's good let's Now work on the header
button
which is let me log in first
Min B
so my Facebook is logged in first thing
we're going to create is this part this
header button is going to search by whom
then these all buttons and these things
coming back to our code
let's open it up into the dot so let's
create the files for this
here
area dot Js and then the new file header
area dot CSS first item
let's cut this part
the first thing we're going to do is
import react
after that we're going to import
the CSS file so for that
area dot CSS
architect will create a function of
federal block
inside this we will return
welcome
let's just save this file
and just wait a couple of seconds
okay
and then
to our
this value
let's just see the full screen inside
this login button
so when I will click on this login
it will redirect us to the homepage for
this Facebook
so we're going to declare the link
to
header
area
and this will drive the object
let's just save the start
we have to declare the react router but
for that let's open our terminal
inside this terminal we are going to
install the ACT router down so for that
we are going to write this command
npn install
iPhone iPhone save react router down at
5.3.0
so let's install these files
it will take a minute so
in the meanwhile
I'm going to add one file here
so let's import that also
it's done
so let's let's just close this and close
the
import link
from
area
let's save this
it is showing a command V accessed
so let's see the issue fine settings
forward
save this coming back to the code
let's see
it's for this
moving back to app.js
here
we are going to bring forward
Universal reaction
we will do the shout
and switch my third here
this folder
which is
right now I'm going to see login and
let's import
header area from headed area
let's just delete this file and then set
this we're going to hit switch
and switch will route our plots from one
page to another
pretty well tell you why we are doing
this you just give me a couple of
minutes
start
when it's true
we're going to redirect our company
login
let's just close this here
let's just copy this
movie
and his we are going to write
header
area
and this is not we are going to need
here
and here also we are going to teacher
so this function we have result here
where we have it in this switch end out
so because of this function the page
will redirect from
it's just
start this
this is doing what it is it will
redirect our login page to the header
page
that's why we have written here route
from log into Data button on the main
page
let's wait a couple of seconds to see
the results
okay

so it will install all the icons for us
like fa users F register and we are
going to use that no worries if you

height of
40 pixels brackets

nice
oh god let's see why it's taking so much
of time
anything for localhost
looks fine to me
it's looking good right now
foreign
like this
okay coming back to our code
yes we are done with our header area.js
page moving forward to the sliding of
this let's let's write it
first thing we are going to do is this
HTML page inside this HTML page let's
give it the phone size
of 60 percent
and the box says it is Project Box
moving ahead we will write in right so
it should come under one and only
zero so let's save and see
okay
fine

let's start the style is used to
access everything that comes under this
value everything
so here let me check margin
in zero percent
now let's work on the body part and set
the body again we're going to
divide the same 1.6
them
with the cup
after that the background color
should be
right but it's 0 2
F5
okay
see ya right let's
margin
right
insert this notion right
zero after that let's
work on this homepage
maybe indicated
this place should be good yeah
let's look on the header button
inside this header we're going to
declare a few things like this
relationship reflects
and justify content always Facebook to
me or not always between we use space
even you lose often
come back now
these items
into the center
and like this only will add the
background color
right
after that the position is
sticky so we can't move these things
again
from Top
it should be zero
yes
100 percent
and then the fight
that's right for now
and water would be
fine
that should be black
and then the margin
access
let's save it and see

like I have declare the middle header
inside that I have displayed
should be Flex with these because it
should come like this smoothly and the
alignments in the center which I am
giving one person these icons and all
like this
okay now let's just save this and as you
can see it's coming like this
so let's add
a few things in this finally
for the loop
