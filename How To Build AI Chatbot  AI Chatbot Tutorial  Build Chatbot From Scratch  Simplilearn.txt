po.com to make an informative and unique
AI chatbot as it offers various AI
models like chat GPT gp4 CLA d e and
more all from a single interface let us
take a glance on what an AI chatbot is
an AI chatbot is a program that uses
artificial intelligence to engage in
humanik conversations basically there
are three types of chat boards like rule
based chatboard AI power chatboard and
lastly hybrid chatboard without making
any delay let's jump into the video now
the first step is you have to search for
chatlink so the first website that
appears is obviously an official website
and you need to click on it and the
easiest way to build effective AI chat
board now click on to chat for free this
is basically the interface that you will
going to get and without wasting any
time let's create a chatbot so you will
find uh couple of options start from
scratch AI chatboard basic lead
generation and lead generation so we
need to start with AI chatbot let's give
a simple and a classy chatbot name let's
keep it ask me it is creating a
chatboard and it has created the name
now I'm inside the ask me project and we
can see a clean dashboard you can even
click it and see there are I have
already created one chat box that was
namely chatly and basically you can see
here the projects and you can build over
here so so the first thing we need to do
over here is to set up our chat box for
that we need to click on Builder it
looks technical you can zoom in and out
according to you it is zooming in and
here's basically Bally the conversation
before we get started please provide
your details below obviously I'm going
to ask their name and email accordingly
and then group uh hasht one hi contact
them yeah I want to I don't want to
change it
and yeah it looks
good so here basically Bally generate an
AI answer they want to any anything you
want they want to ask the user they want
to capture the text and basic based on
that capture text they will provide the
answer and so it looks good to me so I
will move ahead publishing this so it is
published so if you're really interested
in shaping the future of AI then simply
Laars professional certificate program
in generative AI on machine learning in
collaboration with IIT garti is for you
in just 11 months you will gain hands-on
experience with cutting age tools like
chat jity open eye and hugging phas
learning directly from IIT faculty and
Industry experts with 25 plus real world
projects IBM hackathons and the campus
immersion at IIT goti you will be ready
to lead in the AI Revolution moving on
the most important thing is the
knowledge that you feed in now click on
this knowledge base and you need to add
new there presently there are no data
sources added so new you need to add new
so here are basically various options
through which you can feed the chatboard
website uh sit map URL list document
text fact and Zoho in case of website
you can add URL and it can read it you
in case of the sit map it is basically
the scanning of a particular website uh
in case of URL list you can give it a a
list of URLs and the best way is
obviously FS uh the frequently Asked
question question s and let me add those
I have previously made a copies of the
famous aqs you can also search it and
get it there let me copy the question
and paste it over here let's add more it
depends basically on how you add it and
what are the things you are adding on
that will make your chatbot
good let's add a quite more okay it
won't take time okay let's keep it up to
this this and let's click on submit like
you can add as many as you want you have
that freedom and let's make it a good
one after I have added the futes let's
move forward on the appearance side when
you click on the appearance there are
design text and configure in the design
part basically there are colors you can
customize it as you want it uh like the
primary color is black chat width
positioning bottom right it will appear
over here it is good let's change the
image let's browse it and AI I already
had added one yeah it looks good let's
make it up to 70 it looks good and
people will find it attractive you can
obviously change it like now it is a
typical uh chat icon you can even change
it so it is nice let's save it it is
saved chatboard saved successfully now
let's move on to the text section you
can uh write a particular head title
Let's uh let keep it as ask me
support for obvious reasons support save
it is saved then let's move on to the
configure part so uh height powered by
chatlink text obviously it is you need
to move to the upgrade plan or purchase
add-on to use this option uh so I can't
do this ask a user to rate AI response
this is very important because you
always find a reason to improve and the
rate it so let's do this hovering
message enable on desktop enable on
mobile so let's keep it uh I like it
like this only disable option because
sometimes it gets clust thired so
basically I will not enable it then this
is also an upgrade plan option you need
to upgrade it and to Auto open chart so
it is fine let's save it and move
forward now let's move out of the
dashboard now coming to the website with
uh the first is select the display type
like you can choose the floating chart
in line and full screen floating chart
is obviously the typical way that when
you uh open a website it will like
appear like this on the um right bottom
corner in line it will take half the
screen full screen it will be a full
screen so I like it floating chart so
now the most important thing you're
getting your chatbot is ready and you're
getting this JavaScript snip it and you
need to copy this for obvious reasons to
link it to your website now I will tell
you how to link it now finally we are
ready to paste it to our website I have
already made a food delivery website
using cursor AI if you still don't know
how to use cursor AI you can check out
the description below and learn how to
use it coming back you can just open on
the
index.html uh while viewing the website
like what what you need to do is in the
index.html after the script tag like
before this body and tag you just need
to enter and you need to paste it here
like this and you need to save it and
open with live Ser server and you can
see here is your chatbot I'm an a AI
chat Bo that can answer all your
questions you need to give your name and
email and submit it now the second tool
is po.com so you need to go to the
browser and search for
po so basically I got it directly
because I've already logged in you need
to log in uh with your email account and
you will get a terminal like this so
when you click on your bards you will
get to see all the boards it has chatter
flow is what I created before and Claw
3.5 on it it are all these uh boards
that makes po.com special it even has
GPT without wasting our time we can just
click on create a
bot and it will give you options like
prompt bot image Generation video
generation role play and server bot
today I will teach you how to build a
prompt bot so the bot type is prompt bot
and you can click and edit the
picture it looks professional so name of
the bot just keep it as simple and
professional chatly _ 2.0 now you can
click basically it has it will give you
two options claw 3 hiq and GPT 4 mini
you can choose anything between these
two as the result is same and it works
great after the base board is done you
can write the prompt it is basically
tell your board how to behave and how to
respond user messages try to be as clear
and specific as possible it is even
given the example like you a travel
assistant you need to specifically tell
the board that you are this and then
what is the use like provide travel
recommendations for destinations hotels
and activities in a friendly and
informative manner so I want to give
instructions as
you are
a food

pasta always
apologize when
you
don't know the
information in
a polite
way after you have given the prompt you
need to give the knowledge base and when
you click want to add knowledge base
there basically you can select the files
and you can write it manually so as I
have already created the
file let's see in documents yeah I have
already created the uh facts and let's
add it it is processing it it may take a
time till then let's keep it
hey what

good you can add the bio like if you
want to create the bio you can create it

continue without editing see it is
