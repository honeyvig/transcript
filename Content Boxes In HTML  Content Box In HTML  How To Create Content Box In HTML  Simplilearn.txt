hello everyone
welcome to this video on content boxes
in html by simply learn
in this video we are going to create the
content boxes which are used in web
pages for various purposes
so let's see an example of what we are
going to create so in this video we are
going to create something
like this this is the content box with
the icon and the description of the
content box
icons here used is from the font
awesome cdn
so let's start creating
so i have my two files open which is
html and css
let's add the standard boiler plate
we'll add the content
boxes in
html
as the title
let's link our css file
now inside the body
let's add a div class container
inside the disk class container i'll
create another div box
i will require three such boxes so we'll
copy paste this three times
on the style sheet
let's set the margin
to zero
and padding also to zero
we'll set the font family
to
stand
serif now
for the container
class
we'll set the position to relative
and we'll set the width to 1200 pixels
which is the whole width of the content
box
we'll set the height
to 300 pixels
and we'll set the margin
to
240 pixels and auto
for the boxes inside the container
we'll add the position
relative
and we'll set the width to
let me explain what this is
this css type function is used to
perform a calculation to be used as a
property value
this is specifically used for the width
of the div classes
it requires a mathematical expression
the result will be used as a value
so we'll be using lot of this type
function here in this code
we'll set the height to
300 pixels minus 30 pixels
one property of calc function is that it
takes single expression as its parameter
the expression can be any simple
expression combining the following
operators
plus so that is addition minus that is
subtraction multiplication and division
we will set the background
to hash 0 0
we'll set it to float left
and we'll specify the margin to 15
pixels
and we'll set the box sizing to border
box
overflow will be hidden
and border radius
let's set it to 10 pixels see
just save the file and let's go back to
the page to see how it currently looks
so you can see our boxes are in the
proper places we have the background
black with the proper margin between
them
okay so we have the structure
let's
code more
now we need the icon
for that
we will require
a icon from the font awesome
cdn so we'll add the font awesome cdm to
our page
so we will search
quantosim
cdn 4.7.0
we are using the older version because
it is more stable
so go to this font awesome
libraries
here select the version and copy the
link tag
go back to the page and add it here
delete this integrity part
now
here inside this class box
add one div which will be named class
icon
and inside here we'll add the link of
the icon so search here
font or icon 4.7
go to the first one
here you can search the any icon you
want uh let me search for
say
information
so i'll go to the information
and i'll copy this
go back to the code and add it here
now inside this i'll create another div
which will be for use for content so
we'll name it class content
and inside this i'll add one h3
info
and inside it
i'll add some
text uh
copy this much from here
to here
now delete this whole part
and put it inside
p tag
so inside the p tag
add them
yeah
so
let's go back to the file and see how it
looks right now
okay so you cannot see the icon here
because it is black let's try to change
the color here
so that you can see the icon
so let's set it to ff0
okay so you can see i have the icon in
place this is and this is the text that
we have added to this content box
now let's style this content box first
set it back to 0.
now
container dot box
dot icon
will set the position to absolute
set the top
to zero
left to zero
and we'll set the width to 100 percent
we'll set the height also 200
background will be hash f00
i will set the transition
to 0.5 seconds
and we'll keep the z index as one so
that the icon will be visible
okay
refresh
yeah you can see the icon here
okay
now let's add the hover effect on that
so container
dot
box dot
over
icon
we'll set the
top to 20 pixels
calculate the left to
50
minus 40 pixels
with
80 pixels
i keep it to 80 pixels as well
and let's set the border radius
to 50
okay
so now that we have
repeat
so now that we have added the whole
effect let's save and go back to the
page
now let's
design the icon so container dot
box dot icon
dot fa
also set the position to absolute
top will be 50
left 50
transform let's translate it to
minus 50
minus 50
and give the font size
to
80 pixels
transition 0.5 seconds
and we'll set the color to
save the file and let's go back to the
page
yeah
so you can see our icon has now
bigger size and with the hover effect it
shrinks for text to visible
okay
now we need to add the hover effect to
the icon so that the font size increases
for that we'll add container
box dot over
we'll keep the font size to
40 pixels
okay
now it's time to design the content
inside the container box so we'll set
container
dot box
dot content
all the positions are absolute
we'll set the top 200
percent so that when the icon shrinks
the whole text will visible to the text
box
we will set the height
to will calculate it
100
minus 100 pixels
text align center
keep the padding 20 pixels
for proper spacing
box sizing as border box
transition to 0.5 seconds
and we'll keep the opacity to zero
okay save the file and let's go back
yeah
and you can see the icons are in the
center of the shrinking circle
now let's add the hover effect
now when you set the opacity to one
another text
okay we have not
designed yet h3 and p so let's start
designing it
so container
dot box
dot content h3
10 pixels
keep the padding to 0
color
and let's keep the font size to 24
pixels
now you will see the text will be
visible inside the box
so refresh
yeah
you can see this is the heading of our
like this content box
now similarly let's tile the paragraph
tag
so container
dot box
dot content
p
margin will be zero
padding will be also zero
and color will be fff as usual
if
yeah we are almost there
now we will design these two boxes with
some spacing and effects over here
now
inside this
delete them we'll copy paste the above
code here
so copy from here dip class container
we'll change the icon classes here
so for this let's keep search as
a rch
instead of copying the class by going
back to the font cdn we can directly add
the class search here if we know the
name of the class
and here we can add
location
so the class name for location is map
marker
save the file
and let's go back
yeah
now you can see
these things are here
with the good content box when you hover
over this box the
this whole thing shrinks and you can see
the text visible
now add we'll add some styles we'll
change the color and we'll add one
background here so that when this
shrinks the background color of the
black changes
okay
so we'll go back to our code
so to change the color of the box
we'll have here dot container
dot
box
and we'll use the nth child property and
child
one because the first box
dot icon
so we'll keep its background to
pink
okay
and dot container
box and child
one
its color will be when it shrinks
let's keep it to orange
yeah
so
save the file
go back
and refresh
okay so you can see we have the icons in
places and when you go
click on here so the hover effect
shrinks this and this is the pink in
color we have the background orange with
some text here
you can see
smooth transitions
so
this is all for the content boxes in
html you can use different icons here
using this font as awesome icon there
are several icons here you can use any
of them
and just make sure that the padding and
the text are aligned in the proper
places
so that's it for this tutorial i hope
