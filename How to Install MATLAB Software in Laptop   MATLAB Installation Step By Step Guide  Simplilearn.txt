how to install Matlab on Windows we will
see some of the alternative format lab
and some of the basic comments in Matlab
before we begin if you haven't already
subscribed to our Channel please do by
clicking the Subscribe button and
pressing the Bell icon to ensure that
you will never miss update from us
before we get started I have a question
for you in Matlab which of the following
is used to analyze and visualize the
data is that pcad simulink or power
world simulator
comment your response in the comment
section below now let's see how to
install Matlab for Windows well
Matlab is not an open source it is a
proprietary tool now the question is
what is proprietary true
proprietary 2 is a software owned by an
organization or individual it is not a
public domain software that is freely
available or fully distributed as Matlab
is not an open source we can still get a
one month trial for the official
software now let's see how to install
Matlab from mathwork.com before getting
into an installation process of Matlab
just we have to download Matlab from
MacBook further visit the official
website of math work and login using
your email ID and password after that
click on a get Matlab button
foreign
Ted to a page where you can see install
Matlab press on the install Matlab
button
and you can see we can download Matlab
for Windows Mac OS and Linux if you are
a Windows user please press on the
download button and an exe file will get
downloaded to your laptop after
downloading this let's see how to
install Matlab for Windows
now we are enter your email ID
as I am entering my email ID next on
which I created your account on network
next press next
now I have to give your password
press on sign in
now this is an license agreement click
on this button and press next
your the default selection will be a
free trial of your license
and this is my license and it will be
like this and press next
here it will give you the information
the name of the usury in the email ID
and now just press next
here it will be a location where your
Matlab will be installed if you want you
can browse and you can change the
location otherwise it will be a default
location
now you have to select a product I'll
select Matlab Matlab is more than
efficient for Basics and if you can
select any type any kind of products or
in how much product you want if you want
to see new link or any other computer
version tool or if you want to build any
of the project and you want other image
person tool any tool you need you can
select and then press next as I've
already installed Matlab in my laptop
it's showing the product is already
installed for you it will show the
options and just click next after
installation of your Matlab an icon will
be there in your desktop and it's
touch you will get a Matlab for your
laptop for Windows Linux hand for my
quest you can follow the same process
and get your Matlab for your laptop you
can also run any of your Matlab code or
projects online
for that again you have to visit an
official website of math work and press
on the get Matlab button
here you can see we have a option to
open Matlab online press on that button
here you can select I am pressing
continue with the windows if you are a
Mac or a Linux user you can go to that
option
here you can say you can write any type
of your core project anything you can
run on Matlab online
if you are facing any problem in
installing Matlab or any license issue
you can make use of this online platform
as you can see here we can plot a girl
like we can analyze you can plots any
graphs we can develop our apps in home
button we have a toolbar with a multiple
options like new variables open a
variable and we can run any type of code
or project in the online compiler also
now let's say some of the three
alternative top three IDs for Matlab
which are freely available the first one
is Julia Julia is a dynamically typed
programming language with a built-in
parallel Computing element and the
function for Matrix manipulation data
visualization and much more Julia syntax
and capabilities are popular for
varieties of reason for example it has a
feature that allows you to apply a
function to one or more array without
creating a complex Loop you can install
Julia by using the link below in the
description and the second one is the
octave octave is the most well-known
alternative for Matlab it has been
actively development for nearly three
decades for and runs on the Linux
Windows and Mac if you are searching for
the project that is close enough to
existing Matlab language as possible
octave is a good fit you can install
octave by using the link below in the
description the third one is a scilab
and open source numerical Computing
option that majorly runs on the
platforms including Windows Mac and
Linux scilab is a most well-known
alternative and its implementation is
very similar to Matlab however it is not
a precise tool for project developers
you can still install scilab by using
the link below in the description you
can also go for some of the other ideas
like sage and numpy the implementation
of these two IDs are much similar to
Matlab the link for this IDs are also
mentioned in the below in the
description now let's see some of the
basic commands in Matlab there are
several categories of commands available
in Matlab like the first one is a on L
commands like help demo dog syntax Etc
come under this category for example the
help comment will list all the topics
which will available for the help and
the document will provide the online
HTML documentation next we have variable
and workspace information variable and
workspace information has a comment such
as who which lists all the current and
working space variables and length which
sells the length of a vector size which
tells the Matrix size Etc similarly
there are multiple commands in other
categories
like file and directory information as
PWD which says the current working
directory and CD which changes the
current working directory to the next
directory and we have general
information which we have a computer
command which tells us the computer or
which type of computer you are using and
in start and exit we have a quit command
for quitting the Matlab and at last we
have date and time category in which we
have a date which says the date month or
a year now let's see some of the
commands and run these commands on our
online Matlab compiler so let's start
with our help command uh when we type
help command you will get to know if you
are new to Matlab see the resources for
getting started you can leave the
documentation using the L browser here
in few friends you can see documentation
examples key keyboard shortcuts all
these and if you see demo command if we
execute
it will land on a different page where
you can see how to use Matlab how to use
simulink how to use some physical
modeling applications everything or you
can learn everything from a demo command
getting back to the our online compiler
you can execute any of the other
commands for example if you type date it
will give the current date month and
year and try explore new commands and
simple simple problems or programs in
Matlab with this we have reached the end
of this session today we learned how to
install Matlab and some of the basic
comments in Matlab please like this
video and share with it your friends for
more such videos please visit our simply
learn YouTube channel for any queries
regarding this topic mention it in the
