yes good morning conkers I just want to
cover few numericals in dental materials
as fast as possible first of all the
particle size in direct filling world
the average particle size in direct
filling gold
the answer is 15 new meters okay
the second one is about the modulus of
elasticity of zinc phosphide the answer
is 13.7 GP the next is percentage of
zinc oxide in zinc phosphate cement I am
sorry 90% is similarly the first vendor
of Jean phosphate the gutta-percha is 69
1200 okay I hope you are very clear with
these MCQs then after the temperature of
mixing lab means the glass latter is
used for mixing of cements the
temperature of this slab should be
maintained at 65 to 75 degrees swap okay
so hope you have done few of the
numericals now I am just going to give
few important chords I mean this is one
of the confusing stuff and I used to
remember like this das is
closed chamber this code actually gives
the differences between the Alpha Hemi
had a tan beta 300 okay
bees dental a alpha Hemi hybrid and s is
stone I hope you are very clear it is a
dental stone which is an alpha Hemi
hydrate and this goes in closed chamber
it is very important to us is a closed
Channel hope you are very clear D is
mixed dentist or a meter behind hatred
and it is in the closed Champa
and then after three pennies one of the
most commonly asked question in the logo
/ the value is 0.8 to 8% F in admixed
there are few 0.4 to 0.5 percent is in
between decomposition the value 0.05 to
0.09 power test these are the three
values and they should be read for most
so apart from these I want to cover few
medical related numericals question
number one is JEP Ziggler venous
pressure the value ranges from 10 to 15
mm of H okay and second one is all about
whenever I mean like a patent you know
that happened a parent conciliated to
perform in time
and coming to the solutions of choice
for the disinfectant first of all I am
going to tell about the odds net okay
the alginate is disinfected by chloride
compounds chlorine compounds of adults
paulista it's by again the same jet ye
by glutaraldehyde are out of force
polysulfides by rocks and side are
either forms are zeros
