permits you to take two eight minute
breaks between the quant verbal and
integrated reasoning sections
this test assesses your ability to
perform in typical managerial roles if
you think what aptitude and verbal
skills have to do with it then think
about this
a manager is expected to be able to
manage two things people and numbers and
what better way to do it than to put
your aptitude and linguistic skills to
the test
gmat will test you in overall four
sections
integrated reasoning quantitative
analysis
verbal reasoning and analytical writing
assessment or awa
in the awa section you will have to
determine the reasoning behind the
provided argument and write a critique
of it including appropriate examples and
explanations
the ir section is designed to test your
analytical skills to solve complex
problems
here you will be provided with data in
various forms
by processing and extracting relevant
data you will be able to choose the
right answers for questions under this
section
the next section is verbal reasoning

knowledge will be tested thoroughly in
this section
the last and fourth section of gmat is
quantitative ability
this section will put your mathematical
skills to test
most of the time the more thought of
having to deal with mathematics causes
us to despair but don't let this disturb
you as the mathematics involved in gmat
is what you have learnt at your high
school stage you just need to be clear
on the basics and then the rest is all
about implementing the skills you've
learned
this section has 31 questions and you'll
have two minutes to answer each of these
questions this portion of quants is
further split into three sections
arithmetic algebra and geometry
number theory percentage fractions
simple and compound interest set theory
rational and proportion speed time and
distance mixture and allegations
probability are all covered in the
arithmetic section
algebra contains sub-topics such as
permutations and combinations quadratic
equations
inequalities and basic statistics and
also algebraic expressions
and the geometry section deals with
topics such as quadrilaterals cylinders
coordinate geometry trigonometry and
solid shapes
all of the above mentioned topics must
have been covered in your high schools
right hence you will only need plenty of
practice to get a perfect score in this
section of gmat
the verbal and quantitative sections
contribute to the total score of 800.
each of these sessions is assessed on a
scale of 6 to 51 points while the
overall result is graded on a scale of
200 to 800 marks
the remaining two components awa and
integrated reasoning receive their
independent scores the next question we
have is
when and how to attempt the gmat test
you can take the gmat at more than 700
test centers across the globe you will
have to identify the closest test center
to your region and register the details
along with the date and time
many students delay it till a few months
before the application deadline
that's a terrible idea
to be on the safer side take at least
one year prior to your application date
that way you'll have plenty of time to
retake it if needed now the last topic
we have for this discussion is how to
