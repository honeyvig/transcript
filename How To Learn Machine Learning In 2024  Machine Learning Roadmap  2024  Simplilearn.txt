whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back so let us understand what is
machine learning machine learning is a
type of artificial intelligence that
allows computers to learn from data and
make decisions without being programmed
for each task explicitly for example if
you want to teach a computer to
recognize the pictures of dogs you will
show hundreds of dogs pictures which are
labeled as dog and not a dog the machine
learning algorithm analyzes this
pictures learns the features that
typically Define a dog and then uses
that knowledge to identify new and
unseen pictures so if you are interested
in advancing your career in the field of
artificial intelligence and machine
learning simply learns post-graduate
program delivered in the collaboration
with Purdue University and IBM is a
perfect opportunity the highly ranked
program offers a comprehensive
curriculum covering essential topics
like machine learning deep learning NLP
computer vision reinforcement learning
generative AI prompt engineering and
more with hands-on experience through 25
plus projects and access to the 20 plus
cutting age tools you will gain the
skills needed to excellent to this
competitive job market join now and
elevate your expertise with the backing
off our du's academic excellence and
ibms Industry leading insights so let us
quickly get into the ultimate road map
to learn about machine learning in
2024 to start with machine learning you
need to be proficient starting from
programming languages mathematics to
model deployment let's start with
programming languages programming
language is a tool which brings machine
learning algorithms to life start with
python as it is the most relevant
language due to Simplicity and extensive
libraries available for data science and
machine learning such as numai pandas
and Sky kit learn it's a beginner
friendly language and if you have a
prior knowledge on programming languages
you can learn it in a month however
there are ml experts who use art
programming language for machine
learning you to can choose between them
whichever is suitable for you as a
beginner don't get overwhelmed just
start with python the next thing you
need to work on is the version control
system like git to make it clear G is
not a programming language but rather a
tool which is used to track changes to
our code and collaborate with others G
has a lot of features but the basic use
of G is more than enough after you get
your hand on Version Control System the
next is data structures and algorithm
many self- Learners skip this part let
me tell you that's where the lack
understanding data structures and
algorithms will really boost your
problem solving skills which is the key
for unlocking great opportunities in the
top companies like Google Amazon
Facebook as they love to ask about data
structures and algorithms in job
interviews in addition to all this
learning to use data structures and
algorithm correctly can can help in
maintaining large data sets and make
your algorithms run smoothly after you
get comfortable with the data structures
and algorithm the next step is SQL SQL
stands for structured query language it
is a very simple language used to
interact with the databases for machine
learning learn how to use SQL to access
and organize data you need for your
models having an intermediate
understanding of SQL will help you to
the fullest the next topic to dive into
is mathematics and statistics creating a
strong foundation on mathematics and
statistics will help you to understand
how machine learning algorithms actually
work as they are based on this
principles concentrate on linear algebra
calculus probability statistics and
you're ready to optimize them after that
the most vital step is being able to
prepare and visualize data for your
models this is known as data handling it
involves cleaning your data and
organizing it in an understandable way
for the models basically you need to
learn tools like pandas numai to
manipulate and clean the data once the
data is cleaned you need to visualize it
in order to understand patterns and
predict results python libraries such as
matte plot and caborn will help you
create meaningful visualizations to
identify Trends and anomalies after you
are done with data handling the next
comes machine learning fundamentals
machine learning fundamentals are again
divided into two supervised learning and
unsupervised learning supervised
learning the model is trained on a label
data set which means each data point in
the training set has a labeled output
this is an effective way of making the
model learn by comparing its predictions
with the actual output and thus
minimizing errors in unsupervised
learning the model is trained on data
without any labeled outputs the goal is
for the model to identify patterns
groupings or structures in the data on
its own without specific guidance on
what the output should be it's important
to learn about these types of algorithms
and how they work and get familiar with
tools like tensorflow py torch and Sky
kit learn to build and train machine
learning models once you are good to go
with the basics let's jump into the
advanced topics of machine learning the
advanced topics of machine learning
include emble learning and deep learning
emble learning is a machine learning
technique where multiple models are
combined to create a more powerful model
the idea behind emble learning is that
by leveraging the strengths of several
models and minimizing their individual
weakness the overall performance of The
Ensemble model can be significantly
better than any of the individual models
deep learning is a subset of machine
learning that focuses on using neural
networks with many layers to model
complex patterns in large amounts of
data it is inspired by the structure and
the function of the human brain
specifically how neurons interact with
each other to process information you
also need to learn about the natural
language processing NLP which is used to
work with the text data and computer
vision to work with images this Advance
topics will help you to tackle more
complex problems and build more
sophisticated models after that finally
we have reached to the last step that is
the model deployment finally model
deployment is a process of taking a
trained machine learning model and
making it available for use in a
production environment where it can
generate predictions or insides from
Real World data basically you need to
learn to create simple web services that
let other applications use your models
you can do this by learning various
python Frameworks like flask or Jango
you should also learn about Docker which
is a tool to package your model easily
and all its dependencies so it runs
smoothly on any machine master the
basics of model deployment so that you
can confidently deploy your model and
you're ready to go with this we have
