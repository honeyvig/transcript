Interest now without further delay let's
get started so Microsoft 365 co-pilot is
one of the latest AI products launched
by Microsoft so the Microsoft 365
co-pilot will be your AI assistant for
all your office suts from Microsoft so
it can help you EAS up your process of
making PowerPoint presentations it can
help you write down the notes on
Microsoft Word and many more but today
we will be using this particular 365
co-pilot for our data analytics using
Excel so let me remind you this
particular AI tool works with the
versions of Microsoft Office 365 and
later right now there should be a new
feature added up to your Excel on the
top right corner of your home button but
again if it's not it's completely all
right you can use your Microsoft home
button where you can find the Microsoft
365 copilot so let's navigate to the
home button yeah now I'm on my home
button and here you can see a small icon
which is completely new out of nowhere
this is your co- pilot right and you can
just click on it and you can fire your
co- pilot and uh today point of
discussion is about co-pilot with
Microsoft Excel so when you are starting
Excel there are some prequisites when
you're working with copilot So currently
it is in the preview mode so it is
capable of using some data set which is
in the table format I have converted
this into a table format it's really
simple contr a to select all the cells
and then control T to convert this table
uh the option my data set has headers
and okay so your data set will be be
converted into a table and another
prerequisite is when you pop up the
Microsoft co-pilot it will ask you for a
data set which is under 1,000 kilobytes
so my data set here is about 800
kilobytes which should be here so the
only process is you just have to click
on this particular option which says
attachments go to the data set that you
want to work today so I'll be selecting
my sales EU copy and just press open it
will take a little time because it's
completely new so it might take a little
time for that so the only uh catch is
Microsoft copilot is a little slow
compared to the other competitive
co-pilots or AI modules it's not a big
deal they will catch up soon let's wait
for some time while the D set loads and
then you can fire some of the commands
let's say I have given my command here
please help me create a regional wise
sales report with this data set and you
can also so give a few more commands
right so it's loaded right now you can
see the icon here now you can write down
give me country
wise sales
report and just fire the command you can
also um you know perform all your data
analytics what you regularly do right
when you have a sales data set you might
be wondering what it can do and what it
cannot you just have to build a story
about the report what you want to create
and then just you know write it down to
the co-pilot and it will generate the
report that you are looking for
currently it is working on the
country-wise sales report so it should
be giving me the report
shortly it's okay so there are some
problems with this so maybe it's the
data set data type so here we have uh
country and the data is General so you
might want to change that to text format
or character format so you have the text
data type here and just okay now save it
back now you can ask the co-pilot once
again okay or let's try to do a
different one okay now here we have the
order date and column C right now let's
say I wanted to find out which day did
they wasit right is it a Friday is it a
Saturday or Monday right so just try to
ask the copilot let me write it down can
you help me
find out which week of the
day was an order
placed you we have a
column named
audate
column
is C we need a new
column that tells
me the dat
a of the
week when an
order was placed so let's file the
command now it should give us a column D
which is an empty column right next to
order date or it should give us the
steps to do the same just by the command
it might take a little
while okay here we have it certainly
I'll create a new column D in New D set
great this is what we needed and so on
let's try to ask another query can you
tell
me name of the
customer with highest
sale record in the data
set so the previous query which we fired
at will not be reflected on this
particular D set but it can be reflected
on the basis that we sh with the
co-pilot here so currently I don't have
a direct connection with my Excel over
here I think it should be taking some
time for getting me that update over
here but anyways it will be updated in
the D say that it is currently dealing
with that's not a problem now let us see
what's the answer I apologize but it
seems that I'm unable to extract any
text content from the uploaded file it's
okay let's try to file there are some
discrepancies but it should be resolved
soon but let's try some some other thing
like region wise
sale so let's say you are an Excel
expert so you can do it within a few
fraction of seconds can just apply
filters and get that data but there are
a lot of people new to excel so for them
the co-pilot from Microsoft could be a
boon right but down the line there are
improvements rolling out so I could
predict that it could be a lot faster
and you can have seamless integration
with your Microsoft Excel and your
co-pilot and things could be a lot
easier right so far we have the result
over here so it is giv us a few results
and it is finding a little difficulty to
extract a few that shouldn't be a
problem in a few couple of days where
the new updates roll out so um
proceeding ahead let's try to give it
another query or so so let's check the
data set so here we have the categories
and subcategories I think we can give it
um okay can you give
me the category wise profits so here we
can identify which category is
performing really good giving us highest
number of profits so I think let's check
out if we have a profits column yes we
do have a profits column over here so
let's check that brilliant right so it's
giving us distilled reports in one
prompt so that should be helpful for any
of the data analysts which are aspiring
uh right and uh which don't have have
any idea about how Excel really works
okay it seems that I'm able to extract
text content from uploaded files
okay let's try to copy this and write it
down as okay is it
category okay let's copy this as well I
think it's about the case right
category subcategory okay let's let's
first
subcategory
category sales
report okay it's giving us the pre
answer to the previous query okay I
think this should help it's enable to
extract a lot of answers so far
currently there should be some
discrepancy but down the line it should
be
fixed able to extract any text content
from the uploaded file okay so basically
that's how you can work with your
co-pilot in Microsoft 365 Excel so there
are some discrepancies so far so it
should be fixed down the line so that's
how you can use copilot in Excel for
your data analytics and and with that we
