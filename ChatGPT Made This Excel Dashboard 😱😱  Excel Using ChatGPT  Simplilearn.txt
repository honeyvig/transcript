Interest now without further delay let's
get started so now you can see some data
on my spreadsheet so we have row ID
order ID audit date and ship date ship
mode Etc so this means that this
particular data set belongs to a a sales
data set for a store or something so
what I have done is if you look out the
videos on our Channel we already have
created one of the interactive
dashboards using the same data set so we
try to extract month- on Monon sales
region category subcategory Sales
Country wise sales shipment type sales
Etc right so I have uh you know kept the
data as it is and all the pivot tables
as it is now let's say we do not know
how to create all these pivot tables and
pivot charts and slicers Etc we just
know that we have the data and you're
new to this and want to analyze your
data how do you do that chat GPD is here
for the rescue so before we get on to
chat GPD let's quickly remove all our
reference pivot tables about pivot tabl
I'm quickly deleting all these they left
out with only the data right and again
you can do this dashboard using chat gbd
3.5 or in case if you have a premium
version which is chat gbd4 you can
directly attach your data set onto the
chat GPT prompt and chat GPT will do all
the analysis you need right but for now
let's experiment using the chat GPD 3.5
version which is basically open source
and free to use now let's quickly hop on
to chat
GPD so there you go we have chat GPD
version 3.5 we are not switching to
four so now let's quickly um
explain what we are up
to hi chat GPT just keep it simple as if
you're talking to your
friend
the D set belongs
to super store
sales or is
about
the data set is about uh Superstore
sales
report and I need
to
create a
dashboard
for month on
month
seal
so this is the prompt and basically I
just explained in a brief way I'm not uh
giving a detailed information but hope
this works so basically Ally uh what you
are supposed to do is uh give U the
requirement one by one but I'm giving it
in a single prom so that I'll get the
results in one single PR let's hope for
that so what you're trying to explain CH
GPD is that you have a sales data set
and you're using Excel for for storing
it and manipulating the data and trying
to build some Innovative interactive
visually appealing charts and you don't
know how to do it so you explain that to
your chat jpd and uh what are the uh
things you are looking to build what are
the charts you're looking to build so
I'm looking to build a month-on-month
sales report which can be a quarter on
quarter month on month year on Year date
wise however the way you like it right
so uh make sure that your data is
properly formatted first so here let's
check out that your date column is
formatted to date data type right
sometimes what happens is the
representation of date uh changes to
user by user let's say this particular
data set or this particular inventory
has been allocated to five different
people to entry the data right somebody
might use this type of you know here you
have uh let's create a new sheet and try
to let me elaborate what I'm trying to
explain so let's say um person
one person three so let's say I use this
type of uh
formatting 15th December 2025 something
like that and somebody else uses 15 12
2025 and another one uses 15
December
2025 and also sometimes few people also
uh intend or you know may um follow uh a
date pattern which looks some something
like this December the 31st
2025 right and it's not wrong so many
people will have different uh
conventions of writing their dates so
you need to make some data cleaning and
okay if you are coming back to data
cleaning we have listed a video in our
descriptions for data cleaning in Excel
and uh that would help you in various uh
data cleaning operations that are um you
know used in day-to-day lives of a data
analyst so that should help so basically
what you are looking for is so instead
of General go back to the data types and
here you can check out the data type
options and you can either give a short
date long date or in the case you want
to go for some additional formatting you
can also go to more formatting and here
you can check out the custom formatting
options here you can give a customized
option for now I want to go with date
and the date I want to go with is this
particular one which gives me date month
and yeah click on that and you should be
good to go right so make sure that all
the uh uh dates in your spreadsheet are
following one single date pattern so
that when it comes to uh month on month
quarter on quarter and EBY sales that
will help you a lot okay it will just
give you a filtered option it will give
you year on year first then quarter on
quarter next and if you expand the
option of quarter on quarter you will
have month on month and if you expand
the month then you will have date wise
so you will have a you know better
understanding when we perform this
operation in a practical Way in real
time and then we have the next type of
chart where we want to identify
country-wise sales then we have
regionwise sales so let's say I have one
country here let's say one sales from
France and uh I want to know what are
the uh sales happening in central region
of France North region of France so
you'll have region wise sales there and
category wise which category is giving
you the maximum profits or the maximum
sales and inside the category which is
that subcategory or which product is
that that which is giving you the
highest number of sales you can identify
that and based on that you can plan a
business uh you know you can get up with
a business strategy there and shipment
modes so which type of shipment mode
which should you invest in money so that
you can you know offer better services
to your customers so everything comes so
this is what I want to uh you know um
extract from my D set so this is my
requirement you have explained this to
your chat GPD through the prompt and
just
enter now chat GPD should help you break
down the requirements and chat gbt
should help you uh how to you know it'll
get tell you how to uh do the process
so here it will tell you the line chart
so basically it's a it's a it's a rule
that month on month sales or quot on
quarter sales basically wherever the
time is involved the line chart is the
best to represent your numbers so now it
basically tells you how to uh represent
your charts in what or how what type of
chart to be selected that's good but now
uh can you help
me
create the first
chart in
Excel there you go so it tells you how
to create it and sure you have a column
for dates and other corresponding values
so basically it is telling you to have a
properly mentioned or properly defined
metadata or column headers
then select the data go to the insert
tab choose the line chart okay and let's
say uh you wanted to create an
interactive dashboard right so to create
an interactive dashboard or to basically
create a dashboard you need a pivot
tables and you don't know how to create
a pivot table you can ask chat GPD to
help you create uh a pivot
table help me create a
pivot
table
for the first
type for all the types okay
or for the data
set
certainly so it'll mention you the steps
to follow to create a pivot
table there you go so what's the first
step highlight the range of cells that
contain your data set and including
headers and go back to Excel and you can
just click on any cell and control a all
your D set has been selected or these
days you can just select one of the
cells and go to insert menu and pivot
table and now from the table range Excel
will automatically select the entire
range of the table you're looking for or
your working on and in case if you are
having any doubts on that you can just
select all the range and go to the same
insert option and select the pivot table
click on okay in a new worksheet and
there you go you have your new uh say
pivot table let's delete this now
remember we wanted to create the
month-on-month sale for the first uh
pivot table and pivot chart so and
remember about the uh date formatting so
we'll be looking on that
now we will drag OD date onto row here
and you can see here so this is what I
was talking about so Excel has
automatically segmented your dates we we
have about 10,000 rows in this
particular dat set and it has segregated
all the 10,000 rows into four different
years 2020 21 22 and 23 and if you
expand the selection of air it has
segregated again into Portal 1 2 3 and
four right and if you expand and quarter
one you have month-on-month sales in
quarter one month- on-month sales in
quarter two and month-on-month sales in
quarter three and so on right so this is
why I was requesting you to have a
proper data formatting for all your
dates right which could be really
helpful when you want to extract the
quarter on quarter sales and date wise
sales and year-wise sales right so now
we wanted to find out month- on-month
sales right or year on-ear sales so
where is the sales yeah here we have the
sales parameter just drag that onto the
values and there you go now format this
into the currency
type so the currency is dollars American
dollars and you can eliminate the
leading zeros here if you don't want
them there you go now you have the whole
number here you can also do the same for
this
you can select the entire
table go to pivot table okay let's check
the uh options provided by chat
GPD so basically we have created a pivot
table now we want to create a pivot
chart how do I create a pivot
chart
so again it's making really clear
statements and really clear steps so
it's again making sure that you create a
pivot table first right so we have a
pivot table and uh highlight pivot table
data click anywhere on your pivot table
to highlight the entire range insert
pivot chart with the pivot table
selected go to the insert tab on the
ribbon and then click on pivot chart and
uh open the insert chart dialogue box
choose the type you want and uh
customize the chart select the chart so
customizing the chart we'll look onto it
and Fields if you want to keep a few
Fields you can and if you want to
eliminate a few Fields you can you can
also do that refresh data let's say why
refresh data see chat gbd is so
brilliant right so let's say uh I have
the sales data until 2023 and now we are
in 2024 let's say we update 2024 onto
this particular spreadsheet and now we
have that particular data in the
original spreadsheet but that is missing
here in that scenario what you can do is
just go to data and here you will find
the refresh all option once you click on
this you can find the 2024 data updated
here for now we have not added yet but
in case if it's added all you can do is
just refresh your sheet and everything
will change so brilliant suggestion from
chat jpd and save and share in case if
you want to share so let's follow the
same steps select any cell in the pivot
table select all the sheets go to insert
Tab and here recommended charts or go to
the charts option and select the chart
that you are looking for so we are
dealing with uh time so I would go with
the line chart just click okay but in
case if you want to create an
interactive dashboard just go to pivot
table analyze and here you have the
pivot charts and again it'll give you
the same option just select the line
chart here and press okay so you have
your line chart over here so
again if you are editing this so you can
remove the Legends if you want remove uh
anything else or you can customize that
okay there you
go and if you want to edit the name of
the chat you can also do that so I will
do this as M Sales
report okay accordingly I'll change the
sheet
name
there you go right
now quickly we will create the other
charts as well so the process is same
you can hold control and drag this
particular sheet and you have the next
sheet so the next uh requirement that we
had that we requested chat jpd was the
country wise
sales so everything will remain the same
what changes is is okay let's close this
and here instead of order data we will
have okay let's remove this from rows
and quarters
months right country so we will drag
country into rowes and there you go now
we have countries now country wise so
you can uh select this cell go to pivot
table analyze pivot chart and you can
select the bar graph so automatically
gave you the first suggestion as bar
graph click on that and you have the bar
graph over here and you can also edit
the chart you don't want you don't want
the Legends you can remove them and edit
the name of the chart
to Country wise
sales so and uh quickly drag and drop
the sheet again new pivot table and here
you wanted
category wise
sales or segment wise
sales uh close this
particular thing this and instead of
country you're going to add segment to
the row and remove country and you have
segment wise sales select any sell on
the pivot table go to pivot table
analyze pivot chart and here you can use
any of the available um charts here let
me use the final chart or
histogram bar chart will be better press
okay and there you go you have the bar
chart same edit your you know customize
your uh
chart change the name
to segment wise
sales hold control and drag the sheet
now you have subcategory wise
sales instead of segment you will be
selecting the
subcategory you can remove
segment and you can see the chart also
changed here and again you can do the
category wise sales so this was segment
wise
sales you can quickly change the segment
to
category and you have it we quickly
quickly go back to yeah so we have done
the category Wise subcategory Wise
region wise is remaining and shipment
modes
so quickly drag or drop the region
remove sub category from the
list there you have the region wise
sales edit the
name
and the last one which is about the
shipment
modes
remove region and there you
go you can create a new dashboard over
here and name it as
dashboard you can do some customization
to your dashboard like selecting these
sales
giving it a
color there you go now you can quickly
copy and paste all these uh charts to
the
dashboard starting from the
month-on-month sales
copy
paste so I'll quickly do all the uh pas
thingss as soon as
possible
e
the there you go you can also manage the
size of these charts so that everything
fits onto one sheet so for now let's try
to unpen
this so that we have a little better
visual
appearance okay not a
problem and now uh we need some filter
right so something which can make it a
little more interactive that's when you
add slices
and let's say you don't know how to add
slices back to chat gbd and ask chat GPD
how do I add
slices to my
dashboard there you go so is telling you
to
uh add everything in a step by-step way
and it also is is talking about the
interactivity right it's it is asking
you to connect all the slices it it's
telling you to report the connections
right if you just add the slices based
on one single okay basically you need to
select one of your charts here and
select a pivot table or PIV chart go to
the PIV table chart associated with the
slicer and insert go to the insert Tab
and insert a slicer I I'll tell you that
so basically it it's telling you in a
very beautiful way stepbystep manner
right and even after adding the slicer
it it is telling you to connect all the
uh basically all the charts or all the
um you know CH dashboards and charts you
created at this particular tutorial and
connect all those charts to that
particular slicer using the report
connections option and you can get the
interactivity right so in in a very
beautiful manner it has explained let's
try the way it has explained to us go to
the dashboard select any one of it and
uh go to the insert option and here you
have the slicer right so now you have
all the slicers over here so basically
we wanted what type of slicers so I have
created a month-on-month
uh chart so I'll go with order date
slicer which is here then I have created
segment wise sales so I want segment
slicer country wise slicer category and
subcategory wise
slicers region wise so region slicer and
do I have anything else let's scroll
down that's the last one so where is the
shipment
here yeah shift mode country region
category subcategory segment order dates
and shift mode so I will have multiple
slices in one go right now you have to
arrange your slices in such a way that
they are interactive and they they look
like they are sorted in one place so let
let me do that quickly we have some
space left here in the bottom place of
the dashboard you can also keep your
slices there so what basically chat gbd
meant was if you try to use the slices
here it will you know the changes will
reflect only in one of the pivot charts
not on all the pivot charts so to get
that interactivity to get that
connectivity between all the charts you
need to do a small setting which is
called as report connections so select
one of the slices over here right click
and here you have something called
report connections so when you report
connections you have all the pivot
charts and pivot tables that you just
created you can just select all those
pivot tables that you created and press
on okay so that all these pivot tables
are connected to that particular slicer
uh you can just expand this and check if
all the pivot tables are selected press
okay do the same for all the slices I'll
quickly do
that
so there you go we have interconnected
all the charts now let's say I want to
find out the sales that happened in the
latest year just go to the filters
select any of the dates
2023 and you have the data and if you
want to select any particular country
then you can also do that I want to go
with United Kingdom and in United
Kingdom we have all the data here let's
say I want to check out only for the
phones there you go now you have an
interactive dashboard which will tell
you the sales that happened on the date
of 16th of November 2023 in the region
United Kingdom for phones all right and
uh segment is home or office ship and
mode with standard class and major sales
that happen are from nor region and the
categories from tech technology right
and that's how you create an interactive
dashboard using chat GPD in Excel so
each and every step has been mentioned
very clearly by chat GPD and you have
all the data in one place so let's
quickly remove all the
filters and there you have the entire
dashboard right and with that we have
come to an end of this session on chat
GPD to create an interactive dashboard
in Excel if you have any queries
regarding any of the topics covered in
the session or if you require the data
that we have used in the session or the
prompt that we used in this session
please do let us know our team of
experts we'll be more than happy to
assist you at the earliest until next
time time thank you for watching and
