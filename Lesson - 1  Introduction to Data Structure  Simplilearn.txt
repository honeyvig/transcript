welcome to the data structure course by
simply learn since we live in the age of
data it's a good idea to familiarize
yourself with the best ways to handle
and organize information more
importantly to become a software
engineer or a related data science
professional you need to understand
Concepts like data structure and
algorithms a data structure is like a
special way of organizing and storing
information in a computer picture it as
a plan or a structure that shows how the
information can be kept used and changed
efficiently in python these structures
are really important for computer task
helping programmers solve tricky
problems and make their programs faster
think of it like a tool boox with
different sections for specific tools in
the same way data structures create
sections for pieces of information each
type of data structure has its job
arrays for example give a straight line
of elements with numbered positions by
link list make a chain of connected
Parts where each part points to the next
one trees and other kind of data
structure from hierarchical structures
useful for organizing files more
complicated structures like graphs show
complex relationship among pieces of
information with a short introduction to
data structure let's begin with the
basics of data structure so without any
further Ado let's get started
