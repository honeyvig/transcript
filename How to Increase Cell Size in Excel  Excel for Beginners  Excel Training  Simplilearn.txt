's YouTube channel in this session we
will learn how to modify or increase
cell size in Excel but before we begin I
would like to tell you guys that we have
daily updates on multiple Technologies
and if you are a tech gig in a
continuous hunt the latest technological
Trends then consider getting subscribed
to our YouTube channel and don't forget
to hit that Bell icon to never miss an
update from Simply learn now without
further Ado let's get started with our
one point agenda that is how to modify
or increase cell size in Excel now most
of you might probably want to increase
just the sales error here just to
increase the visibility of the text so
one of the easiest way is just to press
on the plus icon on the bottom right
corner of your Excel spreadsheet so this
will automatically increase the text
size and you can see the text more
clearly now apart from that if it's just
not that what you want to do you can
also modify by hope hovering over to the
line between two columns and right click
which will give you the option of format
cells or column width so either of these
options will help you to maximize or
minimize your column width
similarly you can apply the same idea
for your rows as well so you can either
format the cells or modify the row
height of your cell and this is another
way and another simple way is to just
hold that line and drag it so it
improves your width of the column and
another way is to just hover on to that
line and hold it and drag it to
improvise or increase your width of the
cell and same oppress to your row so
this is another way so apart from that
there is another way that is format
cells from this particular option in the
home button you can select this and here
you have the row height out of it row
height column width autofit column width
for example let us imagine that you
wanted to you know just by mistake you
uh you increase the cell size and you
want it to restore it back to the
original thing right so you can just
click on the autofit height and click on
the order Effect called width there you
go it happens in that way and and now
coming back to another
simplest way let us imagine that you are
given a lot of data and you are told to
go to fit all the rows and columns now
we have already seen the format cell
option where I will Auto fetch all the
columns and width of the column and also
the height of the rows Etc right but
there is also a keyboard shortcut to do
this so all you have to do is select a
cell and press Ctrl a to select all the
cells in the spreadsheet and once all
the cells are selected all you have to
do is press and hold ALT key and then
release it then the combination of keys
that is h o i
so your column width has been now
adjusted now the same formula or the
same shortcut key with a smart
modification press and hold and release
ALT key now h o and a to adjust the row
height so this is the way where you can
increase or decrease or modify or
autofit all the cells in Excel with that
we have come to an end of the session on
how to modify or increase the cell size
in Excel if you have any queries

this session then please feel free to
