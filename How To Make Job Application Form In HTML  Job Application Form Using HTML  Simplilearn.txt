hello everyone and welcome to simply

through an html mini project
html stands for hyper text markup
language it is also known as the most
basic building block of the web which is
used to create the structure of any
website with the help of numerous
predefined tags
it helps the browser to understand the
structure and style of a document or
files for viewing over the internet in
this video we'll create the layout of a
simple job application form with the
help of html and css only
so before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have regular updates on multiple
technology videos so if you are a tech
geek in a continuous hunt for the latest
technological trends then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube

so without any further delay let's get
started
html is used to create the layout of any
web page by layout we mean the structure
of a web page today we'll be creating
the layout of a job application form
where the user can apply for a job
let me quickly take you through what we
are doing today and then we'll see how
we can do it
so here we are on the landing page of
our application form you can see here
that we have a bunch of input text boxes
where the user can fill in all the
required information to apply for a job
we have to style this web page to make
it look more attractive to the user
obviously
we'll be using some css for that and
you'll learn everything we are doing in
this video so here you can see we have
the column for first name last name then
we have email job role address city pin
code date of birth and a cv portal so
here the user can choose a file to
upload from then he can apply and on
clicking on apply now you can see we
have
this pop-up which says please fill out
this form we'll go through everything in
this tutorial so please watch the video
till the end and you can post all your
queries in the comment section will
definitely help you out
so let's start creating this layout for
this we will move back to our html
document here we have a html document
and we'll start writing our code here
only the first thing we are going to do
is we are going to create a div or we
can say a container so let's use the
class attribute first let's say the
class for this is going to be container
we'll close this and here we have a
container fine
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to create the box first so for
that we have to write here
div
and again we have to use another class
for this
the class attribute we are using this is
because of the css part we are going to
style each element with the help of id
or class or the tag name fine so first
of all we'll write a class let's say the
class name is going to be
apply box
and then we'll
move inside here and
we have a heading then so we'll write
here h1 and inside h1 we'll write
blog
application
fine so let's go through the
form first so here you can see we have
written job application here now what we
are going to do is we are going to write
this web over here you can see
the font for web is a bit smaller so
let's write the code for this as well
we are going to write here after this
job application
we are going to use the span tag again
and then we will write here class class
is going to be
title and let's say
small fine
we'll write something inside here so in
brackets we have written web over here
fine so here we have
the title of our application form save
it now and here you can see we have job
application web written over here we are
going to make this font smaller on the
css part where we are going to style
this particular with the help of class
attribute so
let's move ahead and now what we'll do
is
we'll create another
form inside this
div tag so we are going to write here
form
and then we are going to write here
action we are going to
let it
be there and now we are going to create
another div inside this form tag so we
will write here div then class we are
going to use
form container fine so this is a class
name
and let's do one thing
so we have this div tag over here we are
going to use
another div tag for each input box we
have
so we'll write here
class class is going to be let's say
form
control fine
so keep this thing in mind we have
different class name for each div tags
we have used still now
don't get confused in this part so the
next thing we have in application form
is
the label you can see here we have the
label as first name here fine so let's
use the label tag for this so we are
going to move back to our html document
and we are going to write here
label
so we'll write your label is for
first name fine so this is
the label then we have the label as
first name fine so this is the label for
a input box now the next thing we are
going to do is we are going to write
here
input
now we are going to use the
input
tag fine for a placeholder or we can say
for a text box then weill write your id
id is going to be
first name
and then we have another attribute over
here as name as well so we'll write here
name as
again let's say
first
name for this
text holder or we can say for this
placeholder or text box whatever we can
say
now we are going to use the placeholder
attribute placeholder is going to be
enter
first name fine
so we'll use
this
and then we'll write here at the end
required
we'll discuss what this required
property will do in a way so let's close
this input tag for now save the program
and you can see we have a first text box
over here with the label as first name
and then we have this text box where the
user can enter the first name
you can see we have a pop-up here which
says please fill out this field this is
because we have used the required
attribute inside the input tag
fine
so let's move back to a application form
here and you can see we have several
text boxes over here right we need to
add all of them first fine so let's do
one thing
let's move back here and we'll add all
the text boxes first so the next text
box we have to add is for the
last name so we are going to use the
same procedure we are going to use a div
tag for that
now we have to come out of this div tag
first and then we have to write here
another
div tag fine so div we are going to
write here and we are going to write a
class class is going to remain the same
for all the div tags remember this is
the div tag for first name so we have
the class name as form control over here
we'll copy it from here we'll paste it
here
we are going to use the same class for
all the text boxes so that we can later
style them at once fine
so let's
right here inside this div tag
we are going to use the label first
again and
we are going to write here for
last name label is for last name
then we have
a
last
name over here fine
now we are going to use the input tag
again
for the text box we will write it input
id is going to be let's use some space
over here to make it more
cleaner to you guys so we'll write here
id as last underscore name
then we have name as
last name again then we have
placeholder inside placeholder we'll
write enter
last name
fine
so we'll use the required attribute here
again so we'll write here
required
and that's it we are going to close this
input text save it again and you can see
we have this last name present over here
on our
browser so this is the label name and
this is the text box similar thing we
are going to do for each text box we are
going to add
now the next text box we are going to
add is for a email address fine
so we'll write here again
div class is going to be
for
control and
that's it inside this we are going to
use the label tag again we are going to
write here for
and level is going to be there for email
then we'll write here
email this is a heading and then we are
going to use a input so input
inside input we are going to use the
type attribute because we are going to
write here email because this is where
the user will enter the email so for
that we are going to use the type
attribute and the type is going to be
email file
fine
next up we'll write your id id is going
to be email and then we have
name again as email and finally we have
placeholder so we'll write here
and
email
and then we'll write here
required fine
next thing we are going to close this
input text save the program and you can
see we have the text box and label for
our email as well
so again we are going to use the div tag
this time we are going to use it for
another text box so we'll write here div
class is form
control and then we have inside this we
are going to write here
label label is going to be
therefore let's check it out once so
after email we have a job
fine so the label will remain the same
but instead of input tag we are going to
use the select tag because we are going
to provide options to the user so you
can see we have four different job roles
present over here we have react node js
full stack and front end so let's see
how we can do it we'll move back to html
document and we'll write here label for
else
job rule fine so we'll write here job
underscore
role
and we'll write here
job fine
after label we are not going to use the
input tag again we are going to use the
select tag fine so we will write here
select
and then we will write here id id is
going to be
job underscore rule fine
then we'll write here name name is going
to be job rule again
and we'll write here
fine that's it
so we are going to
put some options inside this
so we'll use the select tag here and we
are going to use option fine so we'll
write here
option option is a tag
then we'll write here
value the first value is going to be
select job rule so this is what we want
the user to see when he opens the
up application form so we'll write here
select
job role
that's it then we have another option so
we are going to use another option tag
for this
we are going to write your value as
react and
the value is going to be
react
fine
save it now and you can see we have
another text box or we can say select
box here for job rule click on it and
you can see we have two different
options select job role and react over
here similarly let's add other options
as well what we'll do is we'll copy this
from here
well paste it four times and we are
going to change the values here after
react what we have is
node fine so we'll write here node
instead of this we are going to write
here node.js
then we have
full stack so we'll write here
full stack developer
and we are going to change the value as
well so we'll write here
full underscore stack and then we have
at the end front end so we'll write here
front end and we'll change the value
here as well we'll write here
front and
developer
fine
save it now and
click on this job role again you can see
we have four different job rules present
here we have react node full stack and
front-end developers
fine so this thing is working fine
now let's do one thing
what we are going to do is we are going
to create another dev tag because we
have another
text box over here you can see this is
different from other text boxes so for
this we are going to use the text area
tag fine so let's do one thing let's
create another div tag here
so you can see it over here that this is
different from other text boxes so we
are going to use different class for
this so we'll write here class class is
going to be let's say
text area
control
and then inside this div tag we have to
put the label for address
so we'll write here label for
address and
the label is going to be addressed fine
save it now move back to our
html document and you can see we have
address written over here now let's use
the text area tag for this
so we'll write here after this
text area this is a tag we are going to
use the id attribute again id is going
to be
address
then we have the name as
address and we have
the row attribute fine so we'll write
here row row is going to be 4
and after this what we are going to do
is we are going to use the calls as well
so we will write your calls is going to
be let's say 50 columns fine so 4 rows
and 50 columns for this particular text
area first
then we'll write here placeholder
placeholder is going to say enter
address
and after this we'll write
required over here because address is
mandatory fine close this and here we
have the text area element present over
here save the program and you can see
the text area over here it looks
different right we can write anything
inside it
so the text area is here
now let's move ahead and we are going to
create other
text boxes we have in our application
form so let's
move back here and you can see we are
left with city pin code date of birth
and upload your cv fine so let's
create the text box for city now
now city is the same text box as we had
for other text boxes like first name and
last name so we are going to use the
same class for this text box so we are
going to write here div
class is going to be
which class we used previously so we
have used form control so we'll write
here
form underscore control
and after this we are going to use the
label first so we'll write a label for
city fine so we'll write here city now
the label is city with
c capital
save it now
move back to the output and you can see
we have city present over here
now we are done with the label tag so
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to use the input tag again
now for this we are going to write here
input
id is going to be city
then we have
let's do it the same way as we are doing
for others then we have name as well
name is going to be city again
then after name we have placeholder so
we are going to write your placeholder
inside this we are going to write enter
city name
fine
and at the end we are going to write
here required
that's it
close the input tag save it now and you
can see the text box over here on the
browser which says antacity name
everything till now is working totally
fine so let's move ahead and we are
going to create another text box for pin
code fine so we'll write here
dip class we are going to use the same
class class is a
form control
fine
now inside this div tag we are going to
use the label tag again label is for
pin
code
and we have to write here pin code again
we are done with the label let's move
ahead and we are going to use the input
tag again
for input we are going to write it type
because
a pin number is always numeric we are
going to specify type as number then
after type we have id id is going to be
pin code after id we have name as pin
code again
and we have to use the placeholder
attribute here so we'll write here enter
pin code here
and we are going to write
required here again so we are done with
the
pin code as well so here you can see it
works fine
now let's move ahead and after pin code
what we have in our application form
so let's move back and here you can see
after pin code we have dob which means
data but
or we can
just try it here anything
so you can see we have date of birth as
well so one minute let's close it and
you can see 10 1 19.99 so let's see how
we can create this fine using html only
choose from over 300 in demand skills
and get access to 1 000 plus hours of
video content for free visit scale up by
simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more so we are going
to use the div tag again this time we
are going to do it for date of birth so
we will write here dip class will remain
the same as
form control
and inside this we are going to write
here
label label is for
date then we have to write here d
to
b
fine
so save it now and let's see if it's
working or not you can see we have dob
present over here now it's time to add a
calendar to a html fine so we'll write
here
input
value we are going to define so let's
say the value is going to be
2022
and then let's say
today's date fine 24
or
85
fine save it now and you can see it says
2022 2405
let's
do one thing we are going to write here
type type is going to be
date
and then we are going to write here id
as
date again
and after this we have to mention
name as date fine
we are done with it save the program and
you can see it says ddm yy
so we have
to mention here
0 5 and
24 save it now and you can see it says
24th may 2022
fine
let's change it to 1999.
save it now and you can see we have a
calendar over here
we have here since 1999 we can use any
of them
you can see we have here still 20 20
and it's going on for fine so this is
how we can add a calendar using html we
have to mention the type as date and
that's it we are done fine
now let's move ahead and we are now left
with this particular thing we have to
create an option where the user can
choose a file from his system and he can
upload it fine so let's create this as
well we'll see how we can do it
now what we have to do is we have to use
another div tag for this fine
so we'll write your diff
class is going to be the same so we'll
write your form
control
and after this some of the part will
remain the same we'll write here d
or we can say label for
will write here upload
and label is going to be upload here
fine
we are done with the label now what we
have to do is we have to use the input
tag again
so we'll write here input
then we have the type as
file
and after this we have
id as upload and
name is
upload fine
we'll write here required once again
and that's it
fine
so save it now and let's check if it's
working you can see we can choose a file
from here click on it and it will let
you choose any file from your system
fine now we are almost done with the
application form the last thing left now
is the apply now button let's create
this button now and then we'll be
done with this particular application
form completely fine so we'll write here
after this
div
we have to define a class for a button
so we'll write here button
container
now after this we are going to write
here
button we are going to use the type
attribute
button type is going to be a submit
button
so we'll write here apply
now
fine we are almost done with it save the
program move back to the browser and you
can see we have our application form
here the complete application form the
html part is done we are done with the
structure now we know that how the form
will look like the form will contain all
the information about the first name
last name email job role of the
candidate address city pin code date of
birth and an option to upload the cv
fine then the user can click on apply
now button and you can see on clicking
apply now you can see it says please
fill out the speed this is because the
required attribute we used in the input
tag fine
let's move to the css part now and we
are going to style this according to our
need
so here we are in a css file let's see
what styling changes we have to made in
our application form first of all you
can see the background here we have two
different colors present in the
background we'll see how we can manage
them
then we have this container which is for
the application form and you can see
everything here looks completely perfect
and
in this
application form we are creating right
now it looks a bit confusing right so
let's use css and we'll make this
particular form look like this one fine
so
let's start writing our code in css so
first of all we will write here
hash trick
this is for the whole html document so
we'll write here margin
margin is going to be 0 initially then
we have
padding padding is going to be 0
and then we have
box sizing as border box save it now and
you can see the margin and padding over
here is 0
fine
now let's style it
so we are going to write here body we
are going to use
background color initially so we will
write a background color background
color is going to be hash
3 4
a d f f so we have all the colors
present with us and you can use any
color of your choice now save the
program and you can see the background
color is blue as of now we'll change it
later on i'll also show you how we can
achieve that two different color thing
using css so first of all what we are
going to do is we are going to style a
container so you can see over here that
we have a class named
container fine so the first div tag has
the class as container we are going to
create the container now so to specify a
class in a css file we have to use the
dot operator and we are going to write
here container
now inside container we are going to
write max width
max width is going to be 900 pixels
and let's say
margin margin is going to be 0 and auto
save it now you can see there is no
difference as of now
we'll see the difference in a moment
let's move ahead and now we are going to
style apply box fine so now we are going
to create this particular box you can
see over here we are going to create
this box
with the help of css so let's do it
well right here
dot
apply
box fine
we are going to write here
max width max width is going to be 600
pixel for this box
then we have padding padding is going to
be 20 pixels
and then we have
background color as
white
then we have margin
margin is going to be
0.02 again then we have
margin top margin top is going to be 50
pixels
and after this margin top we have the
box shadow as well
so for box shadow we are going to write
here
4 pixel and then 3 pixel
5 pixel
and we are going to use the rgba values
so we'll write here rgba
red green
so the value of rgba are going to be 1
comma 1
comma
1 comma
0.1
which is sort of black color save it now
and you can see it over here
you can see the box which has some box
shadow present around it
left right top and bottom side fine so
we are styling a
application form now so next thing we
are going to do is we are going to
define the border radius border radius
is going to be 10 pixel
save the program and you can see the
border changing from this side
right from each corner the border is a
bit rounded
at the end we are going to write here
text align at the center save the
program and you can see the text is
aligned at the
center now
now we have to style this web first
so you can see it over here the font
size of web is pretty small when
compared to this job applications font
size
so let's
move back to html document and you can
see the class title small over here
we'll use this class so we'll write here
title underscore small
and inside this we are going to define
the font size font size is
going to be
20 pixels fine save it now and you can
see the change in font size
we could have used this font size
property in the html part only but we
are using css so let's do it here only
let's do all the styling over here in
this file only fine
next up
what we have is
we have the form container class you can
see it over here we have the form
container class which remains the same
for all the text boxes so let's style
this class as well
so we'll write here dot
form
container
and inside this we are going to write
display as
flex we want it to be flexible so we'll
write here
flex direction as column so it will be
flexible column wise then we have the
font weight fine so we'll write your
font weight as
bold
save it now and you can see the font is
bolder now after this we are going to
use the label tag so we are going to
style all the labels fine so we will
write here
label
and inside this we are going to write
font size font size is going to be 15
pixel for each label
and we are going to write margin bottom
is
5 pixels save it now
you can see the font size is of 15
pixels now
now we are going to use three different
tag names we are going to use the input
select and text area tags fine so let's
write over here
input
then we have
select and we have
text area fine
so all these tags we have used for uh
text boxes fine so let's do one thing
we'll write your padding padding is
going to be 6 pixel and
10 pixels
then we have the border for each
text box so we are going to write your
border as one pixel
solid in nature and
the color code is this fine so white we
can say or off white a bit of off-white
we can say
then we have the border radius as 4
pixel for each text box
and we have the font size fine font size
is going to be 15 pixel for each text
box save it now and you can see over
here
we have every text box present over here
we have first name last name email
and each of them looks a bit similar to
this particular
application
fine let's style them again so we are
going to write here after this
input
we are going to use the focus property
over here
on focusing we are going to write here
outline
so we are going to write here outline
color outline color is going to be we
have the rgb values so we'll write a rgb
38 comma
zero comma
two fifty five thirty eight for red zero
for green and two fifty five per blue
fine save it now and you can see on
focusing on each text box
the border changes to blue color we can
say the outline is changing to blue
color for address you can see the
outline is black as of now for other
text boxes you can see the outline
changing to blue color fine
now after this input we have the button
fine so we'll use the button container
class so we'll write here
button
container
and inside this button container we are
going to write
display as
flex and
we have
to justify content at the
flexing fine margin top we are going to
define margin top is going to be 20
pixels
and that's it
fine we are done with the button
container as well save it now and you
can see the button present at the bottom
right of our
application form
now after this we are going to style a
button as well so for that we are going
to use the button tag we will write your
button
background color we have the rgb value
for a background color which is
0 comma 47 for
green and 255 for
b
fine you can see the button is blue in
color now
next up we are going to write here
border border is going to be
transparent for a button
then we have
padding as
5 pixel and
10 pixels
fine save it now and you can see the
padding is 5 pixel for top and bottom
and 10 pixel for left and right
so we are done with the padding
then we have after this
color fine so we are going to change the
font color for this we are going to use
the color property
color is going to be white again
and after color we have the border
radius
border radius is going to be
8 pixels and after border radius
we have the transition as well
so transition is going to be
in 0.3 seconds and it is going to be
easy
fine
save it now and you can see the
transition over here
save it again and you can see the
transition in
button fine
now after this we are going to use the
hover effect on a button for that we
have to write here button and we have to
define
over over here
then we have
to write here
background color we want to change on
hovering over the button so we'll write
your background
as
this
then we have
border here border is going to be
2 pixels and
solid in nature and we have the rgb
values with us rgb values are 0 comma
47 comma 250
5. fine
so we have to put the bracket over here
save it now and you can see
on clicking or on taking the mouse
cursor over this button it changes
and the background color is why the
border color is blue on hoof fine so
this thing is working totally fine as of
now
we are going to change the color as well
color is going to be black which is the
font color
then we are going to write here
transition transition is going to be
0.3 seconds and
ease out fine
then we have to write the cursor as
pointers save it now take your mouse
cursor over the button and you can see
the transition and you can see the font
color is black the border color is blue
and the background color is
white or off-white we can see fine so
the hover effect is also working fine
next up
what we want to
style is the text area we are left with
this text area only increase the size of
our browser and you can see this is our
text area we are going to style it first
so we'll write here dot
text
area underscore
control this is the class name we have
then we'll write here
grid column grid column is one
so it basically is grid in and grid out
so
one column and we are going to span two
so we will write your font weight as
bold fine save it now and you can see
the change on the browser
then we have to write here dot
text area
control space
text area fine we are going to use the
tag name here as well we are going to
write your width
width is going to be 100 percent
fine
now save the program
increase the size and
you can see
the address is over here the width is
completely taken by the text area fine
now what we are going to do next is
we are going to
make it look better in this version as
well so we'll write here at the rate
media width
and then we have
max width as 460 pixels
and we'll write here
dot
text area control
we are going to write here
grid column
will write you one
by
span
fine
so let's see if this thing is working or
not
save the program and
you can see this thing is not working as
of now
move back here open it with live server
and you can see the
application form is not what we expected
it to be
let's see if something is wrong here
we have used the form container class
but
we forgot to use the form control class
so the mistake here is we have to write
here
form control for this and we have to
define another class over here so we
have to write your form
container save it once and you can see
it's almost fine so we have to define
the form container class now
inside the form container class we have
to write here margin top margin top is
going to be
20 pixels
then we have
display as
grid and we will define the grid
template columns so we'll write a grid
template columns
we'll write here
repeat
and inside here we'll write auto fit
comma min max
and we have to define the minimum and
maximum over here
fine so the min is going to be 200
pixels
and max is going to be
1fr
fine then we have to define the gap as
well gap is going to be
20 pixels
i hope this thing will work now
let's see if this thing is working or
not
save the program and you can see we have
the same
application box over here as well now
one thing we
haven't achieved yet is the background
which is
of two different colors we have two
different shades of grey over here let's
see how we can achieve it
so for that what we have to do is we
have to move to the body section and we
have to write over here background image
so background image we have to use
webkit linear gradient and we have to
define
the angle here 120 degree then we have
the colors as hash
313131 which is gray
and then we have to write here
50 percent
fine then we have to put a comma over
here we have to define the second color
as well which is hash
four f five
three five five fine which is also a
different shade of gray
then we have to write here 50 percent
so gradients allows us to display smooth
transition between two colors 120 degree
here is the angle and 50 defines the
area the color will acquire save the
program and
increase the size of a window you can
see we have two different colors of gray
or we can say two different shades of
gray here
now we have created our application form
completely fine you can see the
transition working and you can see the
transition working here as well
it's working totally fine
right now let's try to fill out this
formula so let's enter a first name here
we'll write here caution then we have
let's say name
then we have for email
caution and we have to write here
something
like this at the rate
gm.com then we have to select the job
role
so you can select a job
as node.js developer then we have the
city name city name is let's say
now try to apply you can see we need to
fill out this field because we have used
the required attribute in almost each
text box right so let's enter the pin
code here then we have the dob here
we can choose any file from here and
click on apply now you can see we have
to choose any file from here
so we'll use this file
apply now click on apply now and you can
see the form is refreshed
we haven't used javascript with this
form so to make it completely working we
have to use javascript with this form
for now we are done with the styling and
the structure of this particular web
page right i hope you guys got it so
