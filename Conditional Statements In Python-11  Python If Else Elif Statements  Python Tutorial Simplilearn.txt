hi everyone
welcome to another video tutorial on the
python series of videos by simply learn
today we are going to learn about
conditional statements in python
before i begin make sure to subscribe to
the simplyland channel to learn
interesting technologies so let's get
started
conditional statements in python perform
specific operations and take actions
depending on whether a specific boolean
constraint evaluates to true or false
conditional statements are handled by
blocks of if statements in python
now conditional statements are also
known as decision making statements
so python provides different types of
conditional statements that you can use
to make decisions
we have the simple if statement
then we have if else statement
elif statement the nested if statement
as well as nested if statement we will
learn them one by one with the help of
the syntax and code examples
so this is how the syntax of if
statement looks like so you pass in the
if condition and then we have
a set of statements inside the if
condition
so on the right side you can see the
flow diagram how the if statement gets
evaluated so first we have the test
expression that is the if condition now
if this expression evaluates to true
then we go inside the body of the if
statement so this is basically
the body of the
if statement that contains a list of
statements or blocks of statements
now if the test expression evaluates to
false
we execute
the statements that are present after
the if condition
all right now let me take you to my
jupiter notebook where we'll
understand if statement with an example
okay so here i am on my
jupyter notebook i'll just rename this
to
conditional statements
i'll see it as demo
and we'll rename it okay
i'll just expand the
screen size
all right
okay
so first of all let's
write a simple if statement
i have given a comment
here suppose we have a variable called
grade
and the value of grade is 80
then i'll write my
if statement as
if grade
is greater than
equal to
50
then i'll give a
colon
then i'll write a print statement print
passed in the
exam
now this is how you write a simple if
statement so you have the if keyword
followed by
the condition so here my condition is
i'm checking whether the grade is
greater than equal to 50. now here
i've already defined my grade to 80
so this if statement or the if condition
will check whether 80 is greater than
equal to 50. now this is true
then
my print statement gets executed
let me run it and show you the result
there you go here you can see we have
our
printed message as passed in the exam
because 80 is greater than equal to 50.
but what if i change this to let's say
30.
if i run this there is no output here
the reason being
30 is
greater than equal to 50 is false so
my print statement did not execute
okay
now if you want
you can
also print
another statement outside the if
condition
i'll give the message as
execute
statement
after if
now one thing to remember that
this print statement is outside the if
condition
so if i run it
only my
last print statement gets executed which
is outside the
ips
condition okay
now let's write another
simple
if statement
now this time
we are not going to define the grade
value or
pre-define the grade value here we are
going to take the grade value as an
input that is a user input
so i'll write grade equal to
now the way to take a user input is by
using the input function
so first of all we need to convert
our entry into an integer so i'll write
int function and inside that i'll pass
in my input function
then
i'll give my message as enter the
number
all right so this statement will take
the
number from the user
now i'll write my if statement if
grade is greater than equal to
50
then
it won't give a space here
let's delete this piece
then i'll write print
you have
passed in the exam
okay
let's run it you see here
my program is asking for the
user input it says enter the number i'll
give my number as let's say 60.
if i hit enter
that gives me the result passed in the
exam
now let's run it again
this time i am going to give as let's
say
35
if i run it
there is
no output here the reason being our
grade 35 is not greater than equal to 50
so our print statement did not execute
all right okay now let me give a space
here we'll run it again and this time
we'll pass our grid as let's say
75
let me run it you can see here
it gives me the message passed in the
exam
now moving to our next statement we have
the if else statement so this is how the
syntax of if else statement looks like
so first you have the if condition
followed by a colon
if this condition evaluates to true then
we execute the list of statements that
are present inside this if condition
else
we have the else block here
if this condition returns
false then we execute the
list of else statements
so here is the
flow of how the
if statement executes the different
statements
so first we check the test expression
if that evaluates to true then we have
the body of if
and if it is false then we have the
body of else
and later
there are any statements that are
present outside the effects block will
execute those statements
now let's head over to our jupiter
notebook and we'll see
how the effect statement works by
example
okay
so here
i'll show you another example of using
two if statements
so i'll define my grade as 40
i'll write if
grade
is greater than equal to 50
then we'll
print
let's see
pass
then
i'll write another if statement
i'll say grade is
less than
50
then we'll print
fail
now here i'm using two if statements let
me run it you see here
i have my result as fail the reason
being our grade 40 is less than 50 and
hence it has printed fail
now instead of using two if statements
you can use the if else statement
so in this case we'll have our if
statement checked for if grade is
greater than equal to 50
if this is true then we'll print
whatever is there inside the if
statement but in case this evaluates to
false we have another
else block that we are going to write
let me show you how to write the full
statement
so i'll give a comment as
if else
okay
i'll say
grade
equal to 40
then
we'll check if grade
is greater than equal to 50.
print
pass
then
instead of using
the if statement again i'll write else
followed by a colon and then i'll write
print
fill
make sure this field is inside
double quotations
if i run it
it gives me the result fail the reason
being
40 is not less than
repeat 40 is not greater than equal to
50 so hence it has printed field
now instead of taking
the value as 40 we can have the
user give the input so we'll use the
input function
i'll say
enter
the
grade
let's run it again
you see here my program is asking for
the user input
let's say i'll give 80
will
run it
it says pass because 80 is greater than
equal to 50 let me run it again this
time let's say i'll pass
my grade as 45
will run it
it gives us fail
all right
now moving to our next
conditional statement we have the
ellipse statement
now this is how the syntax of ellipse
statement looks like
so here first we have the if condition
now if the if condition evaluates to
true we have the body of if there is
basically a set of statements
now if the first test expression or the
if condition evaluates to false then our
alif condition gets executed now if our
l if condition is true then we have the
body of alif so this is the ellipse
statement body
finally
if the alif condition also evaluates to
false then we have the block of else
statements you can see here
we have
body of else and later if there are any
statements outside this
if alif and else block then those
statements get executed
now we'll see this with the help of
examples
okay
so here on my
cell i'll give my
comment as
left statement
okay
suppose
i have a variable called score
and
this take the value
as integer from the user so i'm using
the input function
i'll
say enter
the
score
i'll give a space
then
i'll write my
if condition i'll say if score
is
let's say greater than equal to 90
give a colon
then we'll print
our message has
passed the
exam with
let's say agreed
i'll just copy this statement because we
are going to
print
similar statement
below as well
and now i'll have my
alif condition i'll write
lf
alif is actually else if
score is greater than
equal to
let's say
75
i'll give a colon
we'll print
past the
exam with
b grade
then i'll again have my
alif
statement i'll write if score
is greater than equal to let's say
60
will print pass the exam with
c grade
next
let's write another alif condition i'll
write lf
if score
is
greater than
this should be greater than equal to
okay
is greater than equal to
let's say
40
then we'll print past the exam with
degrade
and finally
we'll have the
else condition
i'll write
print let me just scroll down
field
in the exam
ok
so this is how you write a
life conditional statement so first i am
taking the user input of the score then
i am checking if score is greater than
equal to 90 i am displaying my message
as pass the exam with a grade then i
have a list of
alif statements
to check for different scores
if all these evaluates to false i am
having my else statement printed
let's
run it
okay
so we'll try out different
scores
let's say
someone's code 95
if i run it
so that
candidate has passed the exam with
e-grade because
if you see the condition my score 95 is
greater than equal to 90 and hence we
have passed the exam with a grade as the
message
run it again let's say i have 80.
if i run it it says pass the exam with b
grade the reason being 80 is greater
than equal to 75 and hence we have this
message printed
let's run it again suppose someone
scored let's say 25.
far on it
okay
it throws me an error it says
name score not defined
okay so this should be score actually
here there was a spelling mistake
i'll run it
i'll pass my score as 25
it gives me
failed in the exam the reason being my
score
25 is less than equal to 40 and hence we
have failed in the
exam cool
now you can also use a for loop and then
have a list of refers block or if else
statements let me show you how to do it
suppose i write for x in i'll use the
range function
i'll go till
10 which means from 0 to 9
then i'm checking if
my x
is
less than equal to 3
i'll print
x
is
less than or
equal to
3
okay
now
we have the
ellipse statement if alif
x greater than
5
i'll print
x
is
greater than
five
then we have the
else condition
will print let me just scroll down
i'll print x
must be
four
or
five
okay
so
here i have used a for loop and i am
[Music]
checking for each iteration from zero to
9 and then we have a set of if elephant
else statements
let's run it
there you go you can see the output here
so first
in my range i have 0
so it will check if 0 is less than equal
to 3 which is true so it has printed 0
is less than or equal to 3.
so it will go till 3
and then
when 4 comes it will check if
4 is greater than 5 now this is also
false so it will skip executing the lf
statement
and it will print whatever is there in
the else
block which is
4 must be 4 or 5. so you can see the
message here 4 must be 4 and 5.
similarly for 5 also the same message
will be printed the reason being
5 is not greater than 5
and then for the rest of the
numbers from 6 to 9 we have
6 is greater than 5 7 is greater than 5
8 is greater than 5 and 9 is greater
than 5
all right
now moving ahead
next we have the
nested if statement so here is the
syntax of nested if so you have the if
condition and inside the if condition
you have another if condition and hence
it becomes the
nested if condition statement
and inside this condition you have the
list of statements or the blocks of
statements
so here is how the flowchart or the flow
diagram looks like
so first
we are evaluating the expression1 which
is this condition
if it is true we are going inside and
checking the second condition
if that is also true then we are running
the body of it which is this part of the
syntax
and later if there are any statements
that are present outside the if
condition we are executing those
so in case the first test expression
evaluates to false
we are coming outside and directly
printing
whatever is there outside
the if condition
let's
see this with the help of an example
okay
so i'll give my
comment here as nested if
cool
so first of all i'll declare a variable
called num
now this
num will have a
user input
value
so i'll write input
enter the
number
then
i'll have my first
if condition
i'll say if
number or num is less than 250
i'll give a
colon
then we'll use the print statement
num
is
smaller than
250.
i'll write my second if statement
and we'll check if num is
less than
180
and will print
num
is
smaller
than
180 as well
finally i'll have my else statement as
print
number
is
greater than
180
all right
let's run this
and first we'll check with the number
100
okay there you go
so here i'm checking whether 100 is less
than 250 which is true so we have
printed 100 is smaller than 250 again we
are checking if 100 is less than 180
which is true again
so we are printing 100 is smaller than
180 as well there is a spelling mistake
okay
now let's see for let's see 150
again we have 150 smaller than 250 150
also smaller than 180
let's run it this time let's say we'll
pass
300
okay you can see our
result here
300
is
less than 250 is false so we'll skip
printing this again we'll check whether
300 is less than 180
which is
false again so we'll skip printing this
statement as well
we'll only have our else block printed
which is 300 is greater than 180
okay
now coming to the final section where we
will see about nested files
so here you can see we have the syntax
for nested if else statement
so we have an outer if condition and
inside that we have another if condition
then we have
the list of
statements or the body of the if
condition
if this is false then we execute the
else part
and after that we also have an outer
else
statement
so this is how
the flow diagram looks like we'll check
for the test expression one
if that is true then we'll go inside and
see the test expression
two
and if that is true we'll execute the
body of if statement which is this part
of the syntax
then
if these are false then we'll see the
body of else one
if the second expression is false then
we go to the body of else two
and after that if there are any more
statements we'll execute them as well
all right
we'll see an example here
so i'll give my comment as
nested
if else
okay
so i'll declare a variable a which will
take a user input
of type integer
i'll say
enter
the
number
i'll write if a is less than 50
so this is my first if condition
if this is true it should be less than
50
okay so if my first if statement is true
then we'll
check for the second if statement which
is let's say if
a
modulus 3 equal to equal to 0 which
means if the remainder of the division
is 0
then we say
print
a
divisible
by
3
and
is
less than
50
okay
then we have our
else statement as else
print
my number e
is
not
divisible
by 3
but
is
less than 50
finally
i'll have my
last
else statement
where i'll print my number a
is
greater
than 50.
okay so this is how you write a nested
if full statement so i am taking my
number as a user input
first i am checking that number is less
than 50.
if that is true i am again checking if
that number is divisible by 3 if it is
divisible i am printing my message as
the number e is divisible by 3 and is
less than 50.
if this is false i am saying
the number e is not divisible by 3 but
it is less than
50
else i am saying the number is greater
than 50. let's run this
and we'll try out different
examples let's say i'll say my number is
12.
my message is 12 is divisible by 3 and
is less than 50 which is
this part of the code so my number 12 is
less than 50.
this is true
then i'm again checking whether 12 is
divisible by 3
it evaluates to true and hence we have
this result printed
okay let's say this time i'll say 30
so i have my message 30 is divisible by
3 that is less than 50.
let's run it again and this time let's
say we'll say 72
so here i have my message 72 is greater
than 50. the reason being 72 less than
50 is false
hence this part of the code is not
executed it will directly come to the
else part
which says 72 is greater than 50.
okay
so that brings us to the end of this
demonstration on conditional statements
in python so first we learned how to
write simple if statement you saw how to
take
inputs from the user
we also learnt how to write
if
statement
then you learnt about
elif statement
you also saw how to use a for loop and
inside that you can use your if
statement your lf your else
later on we saw how to write nested if
statements and finally we learned how to
write nested if statements
cool so that brings us to the end of
this video tutorial on conditional
statements in python i hope it was
useful and informative if you have any
queries then please feel free to put
