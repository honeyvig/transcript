yeah hi everyone uh today I'm just going
to cover the fluorides uh I mean it's
all about the numericals of the
fluorides uh first of all um as I was
discussing yesterday uh I mean the ma
the majority of the tooth structure
either in the anamel or in the Dentin
that
is hydroxyapetite whenever it reacts
with the fluoride it's going to form
fluo hydroxy right so uh the molecular
size of this hydroxyapetite will be like
this and floro hydroxyde will be like
this means it will be larger in size and
it requires more acid for the
dissolution or the floro hydroxy is more
resistance to the acid dissolution when
you compare with the hydroxyapetite as
already discussed the normal critical pH
is 5.2 to 5.5 for the hydroxyde where
the critical pH for the fuoh hydroxyde
is 4.2 to 4.5 so these are the basic
things okay so if you go in detail um uh
coming to the advantages of the fluoride
the fluoride has two main to the tooth
okay or related to the decay of the
teeth first of all uh they causes uh
remineralization lost it will come back
second one is it inhibits the
demineralization okay I think you are
very clear it inhibits the
demineralization and it it promotes the
remineralization so when compared with
these two properties remineralization is
more rather than the demetalization so
uh they can ask a question which of the
following is more faved whether it's rem
metalization or demetalization means the
answer is rization is more when compared
to that of the demetalization if if it
is related to the
fluorides and they can ask a question
like if you take it as an anterior your
teeth fluorides okay higher
concentration of the fluorides are
present at the incisal area when
compared to that of the cervical okay
this is one one more important point
that you have to make a note okay so
moving to the second part uh it's all
about like one of the important factor
the fluoride is going to
act or the enzyme ANS okay an at a PPM
of 50 PPM 50 PPM it's going to act on
the enzy anolas so in in such a way that
it's going to uh affect the bacteria
also I mean the bacterial cycle also it
affects by inhibiting the enzyme anoles
which is one of the important enzyme
that helps in the I mean that is
involved in the carbohydrate
metabolism okay so this is one of the
important point that you have to make a
not and apart from this you have to make
a note about the two formulas which are
frequently asked one is
Flor
reptite that is CA 10 P4 6
F2 and second one
is
cryolite cryolite is na3 Al F6 so please
make a note of these two because these
two are most commonly asked and one of
the major effect of NF okay NF is used
as a tropical asent and it causes
chalking effect chalking effort is
nothing but whenever NF is applied it's
going to react with the calcium that is
present and once it's going to react
with the calcium it's going to cause a
chalking effect means uh it it doesn't
allows the next fluoride to enter
Because it forms a layer of layer with
reacting with the calcium that is
present and it forms an layer over it
and it does not allow so this is most
commonly seen with NF tropical
application so moving on for this I just
want to cover few important things about
the fluorides that is absorption of the
fluorides generally takes place with
the stomach
and small intestine that is
passive so
absorption of the fluorides is a stomach
and small
intestine and absorption of fluorides is
very rare through skin I hope you are
very clear so coming to the absorption
of the Mercury so similarly they will
ask questions related to the mercur in
operator so absorption of the Mercury is
very
high in
lungs and it is least in
kidneys so these are the questions these
are most commonly asked questions
absorption of the fluoride occurs mainly
to the stomach and the small intestine
in the form of passive way absortion of
the fluorides is very rare through the
skin absor of the Mercury is high
through the lungs and absortion of the
mercur is least through the kidney okay
so next is uh coming to the excretion of
the fluorides fluides uh
excretion takes place through
urine
feces
milk tears and
sweat and the stor is is places with
calcium bone and teeth they are the one
which has calcium so bone and teeth are
the areas of the storage of this
fluides so moving on to the next part uh
we know that the fluorides also
transform through the placenta okay they
are transferred through the placenta
they transferred through the milk I mean
they exted in the milk and fluorides in
blood is again an important McQ
fluorides in the blood are in the range
of 3 to 4 and 1/4 3 to 4 will be present
in the plasma and 1/4 are present in the
RBC so they can ask a question which of
the following component of the blood has
majority of the fluorides in it that is
a plasma plasma has majority because 34
will be in the
plasma so next is community water
fluoridation in that they can ask
question like 100% of community water
fluoridation are found in which of the
following countries the answer is Hong
Kong
and
Singapore and the First Community water
fluoridation they will ask a question
this is one of the most commonly asked
question Grand
Rapids here is very important
1945 Jan
25th and it is called as a
22 cities study
I hope we are very very clear with the
stuff that is discussed until now and
from now I'm just going to stick on only
to the uh numerical part okay so uh I
mean uh this community water
fluoridation
wh in 1917 they have uh announced with a
range of 0.7 to 1.2 PPM
and in the year
1994 with a range of 0.5 to 1 PPM so
adding a note about the school Water
fluoridation School water fluoridation
the increasing in the PPM of 4 to six
times normal this is the normal range
whereas in the school water fluoridation
it is increased to four to six times
than the normal because the exposure
time for the children in the school
is less so they increase the PPM so
that's what and uh the first uh the
first uh I mean uh the first uh place
where the school water FL radiation was
started
was St
Thomas where China is
lands in the year
1954 okay I hope you are very clear with
this wh1 in the 1971 if they mention
specifically you need to go for this if
they mention 1994 you can go for this if
they don't mention you can go for any of
these ranges that 0.5 to 1 PPM and why
there is a range is like in the
winter they drink less water so more PPM
is required in the summer they drink
more water so less PPM is required so
that's the reason as Co water
fluoridation there is four to six times
more because there will be less exposure
time and the first place where the
school water fluoridation was done was
St Thomas Virgin Island in the year 1954
I hope you're very clear moving
next okay and uh you need to make a note
about the milk fluoridation
next truly speaking milk is not a good
Agent uh to provide fluoride because
it's going to react with the calcium
calcium is one of the thing that
inhibits the absorption of the
fluoride and uh first introduced
by
Zer and uh First Community milk water
fluoridation scheme was introduced in
the place like
belgia in the year
1988 so
preschoolers preschool
children in the a of 3 to 5 years they
have a they have we have to provide 0.9
sorry 0 .4 Mig whereas cool
people age of 6 to 9 years how to
provide 0.7 Mig all these are mcqs milk
FL flation is not uh recommended because
calcium is the one that it's not a
correct vehicle for the uh fluorides and
the place it was introduced by it was
introduced I mean the scheme was first
introduced in the year and in the place
what are the values that you have to Mo
preschool 3 to 5 they they're going to
mention mly on the on
this a okay School 6 to 9 these are the
ranges that you have to
follow next coming is the salt salt
fluoridation uh it was introduced by W
it was
introduced in
Switzerland salt in the form of NF or KF
or cf2 is provided
so logically you have to give five 1.5
mg for 5 G of salt mean simply they're
going to ask question like what it's
going to be for 1
kg right so you're going to convert 5 G
5 G of so contains 1.5 mg of a fluoride
so what it's going to be for one case
simple so initially uh you have to give
90 mg per 1 KC I mean initially they
used to do and now uh the recommended
you need to go with these value this is
more important now the recommended is
200 to 250
mg per kg of salt I hope you are very
clear introduced by introduced in the
place introduced in this form NF KF
cf2 1.5 mg per 5 G of
salt initially they used to give this
now the recommended value is this this
is this is very important okay so we're
done with the salt now we are moving to
the next
part this is one of the very important
this is actually a table that's give
that's going to give about the
supplement doses that is required I hope
you guys know this
0.3 0.3
to0 birth
to 6 month
months 6 months to 3
years 3 years to 6 years and grer than 6
years so this is a table I think this
table is most common that everyone of us
knows so I'm just going to uh deal few
important things majority of the things
will move around this table in the
florex they they are they they all to
ask questions on this okay let's make it
very simple uh you remember this the PPM
of the fluoride drinking water is 0.3
less than 0.3 PPM of fluoride in the
range of 0.3 to 0.6 PPM greater than 6
0.6 PPM so these are the ones here 0 to
6 months 6 months to 3 years 3 years to
6 6 years so last column is everything
zero 0 0 0 0 First Column first one is
zero second column 1 2 or zero 1 is Zer
1 2 Z all are zero so these are the
things and here
0.25
0.50 1 same
0.25 0.50 clear 0 1 0 1 02 0 all are
zeros 0.25 0.50 just an increase 0.25
double 0.50 double 1as cross is same
they ask they're going to give an
information that this is the AE of a
particular child and this is the water
fluoridation that is present what is the
additional fluoride that is required
this is the answer I just want to make
it in a word format a a of three a or
four years of child approach the
department and they gives a history that
uh uh I mean they have undergone the
analysis of the water that is present
and the water has a PPM of 0.4 PPM of
the fluide what is the additional doses
that is required clearly mentioned age
is this 4 years will come under this Ro
and the column is 0.4 PPM so in the
range of 0.3 to 0.6 the additional
fluide requir is 0.25 one more question
I'm going to
ask a 10 years child approach the
department and they gives a history of
the Water Analysis Community water which
has a PPM of 0.8 0.8 is greater than 0.6
and this is the AE age of 10 years
greater than so if it is like 0 greater
than 0.8 there is no need of any floride
supplementation so no need of flid
supplementation the answer is zero the
questions will be like this we'll move
around I hope you're clear with
this and
next uh few comparisions uh when
compared to that of the erupted
teeth unerupted teeth will
observe 8 times more
fluoride when comp fact that the primary
teeth and permanent teeth primary teeth
absorbs two times more fluoride when
compared with the defective
enamel and normal enamel defective
enamel absorbs more
fluoride defective Dentin absorbs more
fluoride okay so these are the few
things that you have to make a note
erupted teeth unted teeth unerupted
teeth absorbs eight times more fluoride
primary teeth and permanent teeth
primary teeth observes two times more
fluide defective enamel or defective
Dentin or defective cementum when
compared with the normal structures they
absorb more
fluoride okay done it's clear so now uh
I'm just going to cover as much as
numericals as possible so these are the
most commonly asked numerical the first
is uh fluoride
toothpaste fluoride paste is Contra is
indicated only
after 4
years fluoride mouth
wash
after 6 years and fluide
tablets after 1 and half year or you can
go for 18 months so these are the
important values fluoride past are
indicated are indicated or prescribed to
the patients only after 4 years
mouthwash only after 6 years tablets
only after one and half year hope you're
clear with this so next important point
is like human
milk the fluoride that is present is 6
to 12 mg per
ml PPM of seafish is 10 to 20 PPM very
clear human milk 6 to 12 mg per ml
seafish 10 to 20 PPM
so the next is uh is going to be some
some some stuff related to the toxicity
so the
toxicity I'm just going to uh cover the
numericals that is acute toxicity the
value is 35 to 70 Mig of the fluoride
per kg body weight or it can be 5 to 10
G of
NF so values that you have to make a
note is M that is minimum minimum toxic
doses the minimum toxic doses is 2 mg of
fluoride per kg
weight second one
is probable toxic
doses probable toxic doses is 5 mg of
fluoride per kg
weight third one
is
safety SA safely tolerable doses the
safely tolerable doses is 1.25 to
2.50
G of Naf or 8 to 16 mg of fluoride for
kg body weight and to
be it is
almost of the certainly lethal doses CL
certainly lethal doses we discussing now
this this is C is called as name
certainly lethal doses I already said it
is four times it is 1/4 means four times
so it is four times means
uh the value is 5 to 10 G of NF or 32 to
64 mg of fluoride per
KGB okay so please make a note acute 35
to 70 mg of fluoride per kg body weight
or 5 to 10 Mig of NF minimum toxic doses
that is 2 g 2 Mig of fluoride for kg
body weight prop toxic doses 5 mg of
fluoride for kg body weight safety
tolerable doses which is 1.25
mg 25 to
2 or 8 to 16 mg of fluoride
for 1/4 of the CD c is nothing but
certain lethal doses which is 5 to 10 G
of NF or 30 2 to 64 mg per the kg body
weight so the plasma half
life plasma half
life of fluoride is 4 to 10
hours and the
plasma concentration is 0.15 to 0.25
PPM and the
renal renal clearance is 35 mg per
minute duration
of plasma concentration is 30
minutes dry tea leaves the PPM is 100 to
400 p
PPM an AML 2,200 to 3,200
PPM pulp 100 to 650 PPM I'm just going
to repeat again plasma half lifee of the
fluoride is 4 to 10 hours plasma
concentration of the fluoride is
0.15 to
025
PPM renal clearance of the fluoride is
35 Mig per minute duration of the plasma
concentration is 30 minutes dry tea
leaves 100 to 400 PPM enamel 2,200 to
3,200 PPM pulp 100 to 650
PPM so next is
 cementum is the highest among all
the dental structur that is 4,500
PPM salav glands 0.05 to 0.07 p
we have covered uh dry tea leaves they
regularly ask for the tea also normal te
is 97 PPM and DED tea leaves is in the
range of 100 to 400
PPM
Dentin is 200 to 300
PPM shellfish is 10 to 20 PPM
Dental plaque is 15 to 64
PPM okay uh clear cementum is 4,500
highest among all the dental structures
salivary glands is 0.05 to
0.07 PPM normal te is 97 dry tea is 100
to 400 Dentin is 200 to 300 shellfish is
10 to 20 PPM Dental plaque is 15 to 64
PPM
now
is mouthwash required 2 percentage of NF
the PPM is 9,000
PPM so they can ask next like what is
0.2 percentag
NF by 10 so it is 900 PPM so this is
generally recommended
weekly okay so they can ask 0 point 05
NF you have to convert 2 percentage is
9,000 what is 0.05 NF 0.05 NF is 225 PPM
which is given
daily so next is
0.025
NF that is generally given for the
fourth
night so these are the values weekly how
much amount of the NF is required
0.2% daily how much NF requires 0.0 5 NF
fourth night how much amount of NF
required 0.0025 NF they can ask like
like in the terms of ppms amount of NF
in terms of PPM that should be given for
weekly that should be given for daily
simple okay let's make it very
simple so last but not the least I'm
just going to cover what is 1 PPM of
fluoride 1 PPM of fluoride is nothing
but 1 mgram per kg of material it may be
paste or anything I mean it is weight
it is 1 mg per kg weight so another
terms is like what is 1 PPM one
part
per million or it can
be 1 mg per liter in terms of liquid is
1 Mig per liter in terms of weight it is
1 mg per kg of paste I hope you're
clear with this
so next I want to cover element fluoride
I hope you know the atomic number of the
fluoride that is nine so element
fluoride was uh discovered in the year
1931 and the person associated with this
is
Churchill n technique defluoridation
technique you know in the year
1975 so moled anamel is a term
that is used for the fosis in the year
1901 by macki so these are the few uh
things that you have to make a
note uh I hope I have covered as much of
stuff as possible uh relevant to the
florid I mean then I just want to add
the percentage of decrease of the
carries in community water fluoridation
is
60% and in school water flu radiation is
25 to 40%
is okay so areas of I
mean emic areas of
fluoride in India are 5% so I'm done
with the fluorides thank you and signing
off stre from MDS conquer
