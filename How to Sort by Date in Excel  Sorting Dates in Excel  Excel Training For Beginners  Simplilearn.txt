let's get started with our one point
agenda that is how to sort data in excel
so on my spreadsheet you can see some
employee data and on the column f and
the g you can see employee date of worth
and employee native joining
for example you wanted to sort the
employee data in the form of earliest
joining employee and the latest joining
employee right that is who is the
employee who joined first to this
company and who is the employee who
joined last to this company so for that
you just need to select the column of
date so let's select both the columns
and go to home and check or verify if
the data type is date or not so
generally the data tip will be set to
general by default by excel so we need
to make sure that we have the proper
data type which is state now that we
have the proper data type select the
entire column and go to the data option
and here select the sort option add in
the sort option
select the expand selection
click on sort and here
sort by employee date of joining and
oldest to newest that's what we wanted
the oldest employee or the you can also
set it to the newest employee to hold us
according to your requirement but we'll
go to oldest to newest according to the
case study right now just click on ok
and that should be done
so emily who's a manager is the oldest
employee who joined the company and
chris was a trainee and it support is
the latest employer who joined the
company now that's how you sort date in
excel and with that we have come to an
