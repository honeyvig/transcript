mind-blowing gpts inside J GPD so let's
start with an example and those who want
to jump straight to top 10 gpts can
reach this with the time stamp mentioned
in the description box so let's start
with the example imagine a world we're
talking to a machine feels As Natural as
chatting with a friend this is the
reality with GPT or generative pre-train
trans former a type of AI that handles
anything from cooking tips to legal
advice each day these AIS make complex
knowledge accessible to Millions

so let's get started so guys here we are
in the GPT that is Chad GPT 4 version I
have the premium version that is I have
GPT 40 gp4 GPT 3.5 I have the gp4
version and if I show you my plan I have
the plus
plan so here I will show you guys where
we can explore the gpds so this is a
section where we are having export gbts
we click on that here is the whole
overview here are the top piics that are
featured then if you click on writing so
these are the custom gpts so now I will
tell you what is a GPT and how do they
work so a GPD is a type of artificial
intelligence model that is designed to
generate humanlike text based on the
input it receives so it uses a machine
learning technique called Transformers
which allows it to consider the context
of all words in a sentence rather than
one at a time so this makes gpds
exceptionally good at understanding and
generating Cent and contextually
appropriate responses so these are the
gpts and what are custom gpts if I tell
you so these are all the custom gpts
what I told you was GPT that is the
whole GPT 4 version so they are based on
Transformers now if I tell you about
custom gpts they are Genera pre-train
Transformers and are tailored versions
of the original GPT models developed by
open and these custom models are
modified to serve specific task or
Industries more effectively such as
legal assistance medical inquiries or
customer support So by training on
Specialized data sets they can offer
more precise and relevant responses in
their respective feeds so I will show
you guys how you can create a custom GPD
also so I created on the create section
I'll show you guys once again so this is
a section you just need to click on
create I will show you guys the whole
process at the last of the video after
after exploring the top 10 amazing gpds
okay here you can create it and you can
here have the preview of the custom GPD
if you want to create
it okay so now if I tell you the
benefits of these gpts so they offer
several benefits one is efficiency that
is it automates repetitive task and
handle multiple queries simultaneously
so if you click on chat
GPT and if you want to have some data
analysis you have to type type the
prompts again and again for that we have
a particular custom
GPT that is
data
analyst think research analysis we will
move here okay this is for research or I
will tell you guys that's consensus so
this is the custom GPT that have all the
research papers all the studies provided
in it if I tell you guys in the create
section you could attach more and more
files if you attach files here data and
other related information it will help
you create the perfect custom GPT so you
don't have to write the prompts again
and again or automate you can automate
the repetitive task here number two
benefit what I can tell about is
scalability this assist in scaling
services without the need for
proportional increase in Human Resources
then comes the customization you can
tailor responses based on the specific
needs of a business or context then you
have the accessibility it improves
access to information and services by
providing another layer of interaction
so these benefits of gpts are the ones
that help you guys now we start with the
top 10 gpts that are prevailing now so
starting with number one that is cod
GPT so here is the Cod GPT you could see
here other gpts that are used for coding
purposes you could use any GPT so let's
start this or you could have another GPT
I will show you guys that is for
programming you just click on
programming and these are the top gpts
that are prevailing in the programming
world so if I click on Code Pilot so
this has been rated 4.2 2 million plus
conversations and rank number one in
programming so we click on start chat
now we are here with the custom GP
and you don't need to download any GPT
or you don't need to install any GPT you
just have to click on the export GPT
section and you would be accessible to
all the
gpts so here we have this Code Pilot so
what does this do is this GPT assist
users in writing and debugging code and
it provides programming guidance suggest
Corrections and can help with code
optimization for a variety of
programming languages and this gbd is
useful for both noce programmers needing
help with basic Intex and for
experienced developers looking for
advanced optimization suggestions you
could see that he is suggesting some of
the prompts that he can reply to and we
will write some prompt and ask this Code
Pilot what he can
do so I will ask
him can
you write a
function in Python language and what it
should do is that should sort a list of
numbers so you could ask this GPD or you
could provide your code and if you want
to debug your code you can just provide
the code to him and he will debug for
you so you could see that it has
provided the code for sorting the
numbers so this was one of the GPD now
moving to another we'll move to explore
gbt sections one again and we have one
most popular that is canva so canva GPD
assist users in designing and editing
visual content by providing suggestions
automations and creative ideas tailor to
the users design needs uh I don't know
why it's not
showing yeah this is the one canma you
could see that it has been rated three
star 2 million plus conversations now we
click on start and you could have a
generic view also
like what this GPT do uh wait a
second I'll show you guys once again so
if you click on that you could read the
description here also that is
effortlessly design anything that would
be presentations logos social media post
these are the conversation starters here
and here are the capabilities that
retrieves or takes actions outside of
GPT the ratings given by the
users now we'll start the chat and here
we will we could just ask him what they
are suggesting also I need a poster for
are online stores seasonal sale but they
have not specified what their store is
about or we can ask him that create a
series of Instagram post promoting an
upcoming music festival and including
vibrant colors and modern Design
Elements so we will go with their
suggestion only let's see what they
so let's create an i
catching start to creative Journey with
can but we will Design together today
okay so create a
poster for medical
online store you could specify like uh I
won't be talking about the prompts here
more how you can generate the good
prompts so for generating the good
prompts you can watch our another video
that is prom
engineering and for that you guys have
to do is you have to write the full
prompt that what you need to be and but
you need Char to do you need to be more
specific as you can see that it has
created the online poster but it's not
good looking or engaging which can
attract customers but it's okay like
with this prompt you can get this you
have to be prompt
specific so this was our second GPD now
moving to third going back back to
explore jpd
section and we will search for Del now
so Del is very popular
nowadays think okay D was there only
it's the topmost only so it's an AI
program that is capable of generating
unique images from textual descriptions
and it Blends Concepts and styles to
create high quality images based on user
inputs so we can ask him to generate an
image of a futuristic cityscape at
Sunset blending elements of cyberpunk
and Art Deco Styles you could add
anything in the prompt what you need to
create so I will ask him that generate
an image of a
futuristic city space at
Sunset you could add more things to
it be more specific and the custom gpts
will create the thing for you
so you could see that our D custom gbt
has provided the response to us so these
are the futuristic city at the sunset
you can download these images and use
them and you can give the credits to GPD
also so this was all about our third gbt
now moving to the next one and we will
see now web pilot this is also one of
the top most search and the recently
used like this browsing history that was
the recently used
used so it has been rated 4.2 by the
users 800,000 plus conversations and
hash4 in productivity Global so we'll
start the chat with it and so what does
this GPT do this GPT helps users by
summarizing long web pages into concise
versions highlighting the main points
and crucial
information for example we
will have some simply learn articles
we'll provide the link
here we'll provide the link to web pilot
GPT and then we'll ask him to summarize
this article in around 100 or 200 words
okay so we have paste the link here we
will ask him summarize the
article in around one50 words okay so
let's see you could see here that it has
started taking the
action okay uh we made a mistake here
the link is about some story blogs it
didn't copy the article
link we will copy it again and paste it
here yeah now you can see that it
has go
link now we'll ask him
again as it has summarized a story block
video what I have copied earlier I
think so you could see that it has
generated the response that the article
from Simply learn outlines the role of a
risk manager and it has summarized the
article into 150 words so this is the
magic of web pilot GPD now coming to
number five so now moving to the fifth
GPT and we will explore it from the
writing section this is the right for
me so this is the fifth GPT on our list
so what you can do with this is you can
have a right for me a tailored engaging
content with a focus on quality
relevance and precise word count so you
could ask him we will go for
the like what they have suggested the
prompts we have going with that only so
you could see that how they're
writing and what English words they are
using how is their vocabulary so these
kind of gpts are collaborat made to get
all the content delivered with a great
understanding of vocabulary and the
content creation so with that we'll move
to our next GPD that is 6
gbd and that will be diagrams so this is
one of my favorites so this tool creates
flowcharts mind maps uml chart FL uml
workflow sequence ER database and
architecture visualization for for code
so what does this do is it creates
diagrams and charts instantly from
descriptions aing in visual data
presentation and Analysis so if I ask
him
that generate a flowchart
illustrating the software development
life
cycle with
stages and Key activities in each stage
so you could see that it has started
generating the response it will create
the diagram first it had all the stages
listed here and now he is telling about
the diagram syntax so it seems that
flowchart is not a supported diagram
type for rendering so is fetching syntax
that is so you guys so here is a diagram
what diagrams GPD has
created and you could view in the full
screen here
download the PNG file if you want to use
this diagram and if you want to see the
code you could see here or what theory
part they have done behind this diagram
or what they have done for creating this
diagram that is they have used the graph
here and you can edit the code also here
so this is the code written to create
this
diagram so this was all about our six
GPT now moving to the next GPT and that
would be around the data analysis
part uh not research and Analysis but it
would be around data
analysis I would search for you guys
that would be data analyst and I've used
this GPT many times and it's one of my
favorites so what does data analyst do
is so this jpd helps analyze large sets
of data providing insights performing
statistical analysis and making
predictions based on the data Pro it
I'll will show you guys what it can
do so I think yeah this is the one I use
it's not showing any ratings or
something but yeah this one is good so
what we'll do is we will upload a file
so I must be having some Excel
files okay Excel data let's see what
this data
contains okay we'll open it
only can you analyze
the Excel
file and tell
me what it is
about you could draw graphs bar charts
or analyze data and got some pivot
tables with this GPT model you could see
that it has started
analyzing and I've used it many times
for generating my reports
so you could see that what it has
provided is this Excel file contains two
sheets with the following content so
sheet that is data 2 it has it includes
columns such as order date customer name
so these are the things that are
provided in the sheet if you need to get
the code you could have the code here
and use this in your ID and it will
provide all the things what here GPD is
doing you can do in your ID
so if I show you guys what this file
contains as okay so this is the data so
we have two spreadsheets here one is
data one is data 2 and it has provided
columns and you can do the analysis
further so this was all about data
analyst GPD now moving to the next that
is eth GPD that is consensus so this we
will use we'll move to education section
and here we should find that or else
we'll search it so this is one of the
most used GPD here so this is the one
that is you can ask the research chat
directly with the world's scientific
literature so it aids in academic
research by locating relevant scholarly
articles papers and studies quickly and
summarizing their
findings so what we can ask him is we
can ask him find the recent studies
on the impact
of virtual
reality and on learning
outcomes in higher
education so it is asking for the
permission so we will grant the
permission to him that is always
allow and it has all the research papers
that are available on the net and you
could see that it has started providing
the response and these are the evidence
for this and he has mentioned the
research papers all the
articles that are that have the studies
so this is about the consensus GPT now
moving to the number nine and on number
nine we have teex support advisor that
is taex troubleshooting
we'll move to explore GPT
section and search
for tech support
advisor so this GPT provides solutions
to Common technical issues offering step
bystep troubleshooting guidance so we
will ask him that my laptop is running
slow
uh despite no visible running
application so what steps can I take to
diagnose and fix the
issues uh
despite no running
application so what
steps can I take to
diagnose and fix the issue
so you could see that it has started
providing the response like check the
task manager check for malware free up
disk space and update your system check
startup programs so this is the perfect
Support Tech advisor as a GPD that can
help you diagnose any Tech related
problem in your laptop in your desktop
or in any device so this is the great
GPD that we have here so now number 10
on the list is legal
advisor So This legal adviser helps
draft review and interpret legal
documents offering guidance on legal
terminology and
compliance so you could update any legal
document here and ask him what this is
about and what should I do this if you
go to any court hearing or something I
hope you not but if you have any
document you can update it here or
upload it here and ask this GPT what
this is about and what I can do to
counter it so I will ask him something
so I need a or I need to draft a lease
agreement for a residential
property okay so I will also ask him
that what closes should I
include to protect both the landlord and
the
Tenant so you would see that it has
started generating the response that
creating a comprehensive residential
lease agreement is crucial and these are
the closes that you should include
number one is part is clearly State the
full names and contact information
property description lease term rent
security deposit utilities and
maintenance use of property occupancy
limits pets access and entry so this was
about our legal advisor GPT that was
number 10 and guys we have a lot of gpts
in the explore GPT section and you can
create your own also uh I told you about
how you can create that just go on the
explore GPT
section and then click on
create and here on the left side you
have a create tab where you can use
plain language to customize your own GPT
through prompting you just have to write
the prompt here and it will do the task
for you and you also have a
configuration tab where you can provide
more information about the custom GPT
that is such as the name and description
what this GPT is about and what exactly
the GP does and what it should not do
and when you make changes in the create
and configure tab you will see these
live updates in the preview window on
the right hand that is this and message
your GPT to accesses abilities you can
start messaging also and you can also
choose the capabilities that is web
browsing D image generation and you can
also upload the files that you want to
store data for a particular GPD you can
upload the files here
also so this is how you can create a new
jpd so with that guys we have come to
