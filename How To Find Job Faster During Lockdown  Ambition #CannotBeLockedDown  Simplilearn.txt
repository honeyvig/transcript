how to get a job faster during the
lockdown
the global pandemic resulted in a major
crisis and worldwide lockdown
with jobs being a big part of the
equation and an important stepping stone
for most students who recently graduated
most graduates are in a hunt for their
dream jobs
as a new graduate looking to start in
your career you already have enough
complications to land your dream job
especially when you're trying to
dominate dozens of other equally
qualified applicants for the same
position
don't dampen up your hopes this video
from simply learn on how to get a job
faster during lockdown is all about
helping you with some sensational tips
and tricks that you can hide under your
sleeves and pull out to bag that dream
job at the earliest and with ease
you may even be able to use some of the
current challenges to your advantage by
looking at the glass half full
so here comes the first one
understand that recruitment is happening
online before lockdown most of the top
it giants migrated to online methods of
recruiting candidates
now with lockdown regulations in place
companies are relying on the internet
alone for their recruitment process
so the key here is
you need to ensure that your presence on
the internet is strong and professional
take advantage of the available online
resources that can help connect you with
mass recruiters
next
try to put your skills to the test
brush up on your virtual interview
skills
you may have already practiced your
interview skills through a mock
interview but these days most interviews
are happening virtually through video
conferencing software
practice your virtual interview skills
before the real thing because this is an
entirely different process than
interviewing face to face
in the traditional interview you'd be
meeting the interviewer in person and
you'd have a comfortable interview
session with an ample amount of time to
assess your skill set
in contrast the virtual interviews
usually use coding windows which might
pose problems like a software
compatibility issue or similar
you'll also want to ensure you won't run
into any technical difficulties when
it's time for an actual interview and a
mock virtual interview allows you to
test out your microphone and speakers
and ensure that you're familiar with the
software they're using
get used to networking online
before the lockdown online networking
with platforms like linkedin was only a
tiny portion of meeting like-minded
professionals making solid connections
and finding job leads
many people relied heavily on
face-to-face interaction in-person
conferences job fairs and other forms of
networking for finding a job
the current lockdown regulations would
not allow traditional interview
practices that allow mass gatherings and
face-to-face sessions
no other way would seem to be helpful
than networking online for an interview
if you haven't already start to become
more comfortable with networking online
as this may be your only form of
interviewing for a while
we understand online networking could be
a little challenging initially but
that's the only option as of now
i'm pretty sure you'd get real
comfortable quickly
through online networking you can
interact with fellow candidates online
and discuss your goals over a video chat
online networks can help put a face to
the name and ensure you don't get lost
in many other networking messages and
emails
so
this brings us to the fourth trick
are you comfortable with phone calls
well the next trick coming up is all
about telecommunication
be open to telecommuting and highlight
your ability to work remotely
every it company and a few others did
shift to work from home culture during
the current lockdown
it would be best if you accepted that
fact it would be best to stay calm and
feel comfortable enough to interact with
people and colleagues over a phone call
or video call
telecommunication would be the only way
to solve the issues that require
teamwork and collaboration with each
other
some people love the idea of working
from home due to its convenience and
improved work-life balance while others
find it to be distracting and
disconnecting if you're the latter
consider taking on a remote role if
you're looking to find a job quickly
working from a remote location will open
up many more opportunities
remote working culture could help you
explore more about your job comfortably
and also you can have an option for
applying to a broad spectrum of job
opportunities
if you already have experience working
remotely make sure employers and
recruiters know remote work culture is a
great tactic when trying to figure out
how to get a job faster include relevant
keywords in your linkedin profile resume
and cover letter
highlight your familiarity with the
technical aspect of working from home
such as proficiency with video
conferencing tools and other
collaboration software
put a positive spin on working remotely
and share that you're organized and able
to meet deadlines even when you're not
physically working in the office
next in the bucket try keeping an eye on
the active mass recruiters
follow companies that are actively
hiring
at the height of the worldwide lockdown
many companies had to lay off many
employees while a few others had to
seize operations completely
and to stay afloat some companies didn't
necessarily lay off workers but they put
hiring freezes in place with no
intentions to grow their teams anytime
soon
other companies however remained
unscathed and continue to thrive they
continue to grow their teams and are
consistently posting new job openings
even if certain companies aren't
currently hiring for a role that you'd
be interested in or qualified for keep
an eye on them anyway if they are
actively growing because they continue
to add to their teams it may be only a
matter of time before they add a job
opening that's perfect for you and
you'll want to be in the know as soon as
a relevant opening becomes available
the point is if you're looking for a way
to get a job faster be proactive
so now we land on the most friendly
trick to search for your dream job
social media
turn to social media for available
opportunities
it has been reported that approximately
58 of recruiters are taking advantage of
social media platforms to recruit new
talent
aside from networking with individuals
on social media you'll want to follow
the companies you're interested in as
these platforms may be the first place
they post about new job openings
you can also search relevant hashtags to
find companies and job roles that you
didn't even know about but that may be a
perfect fit for you
the next one is a little complicated but
relatively helpful
be more open-minded about opportunities
some people are focused on very specific
goals and they know what type of job
they must land or what company they need
to work at to start their carefully
planned career track
however with the challenges that so many
people face with the lockdown
now could be an excellent time to
reevaluate your goals and consider being
more open-minded about the types of
roles you take on
the less particular you are especially
if you are willing to take on a small
role the easier it will be for you to
tackle how to get a job faster during
the pandemic and
who knows
the job you eventually find may put you
on a new career path that's even better
than the one you initially planned
here we are at the final but most
important trick of all
upgrade your skills
many people have a lot more free time on
their hands due to the lockdown
restrictions but use this extra time to
your advantage by learning new skills
upskilling can help you become a more
desirable candidate and you'll be more
qualified for more positions
