hey traders let me show you everything
you need to know about for loops in pine
script in two minutes and 45 seconds for
loop structure looks like this you first
need to use the four keyword operator
obviously and then we need to declare a
counter variable you can call this
anything and it's only accessible within
the scope of this for loop the next
thing to do is assign this counter an
initial value so we'll start with zero
then we need to tell panscript what to
count up to so for this example let's
just put in 10. this could also be a
negative number to count backwards so
for example we could count from 10
to zero and now this for loop would
count backwards but i'll leave it as
that for now the next optional feature
of a for loop is that we can tell pine
what increment to loop by so for example
if i put two in there this for loop
would now skip every odd number but i'll
leave that out for now and we'll just
count by increments of one now for this
example let's count how many green bars
were plotted over this look back period
to do that we can use our counter as our
historical operator so if the close of
the current loop is greater than the
open of the current loop we have a
bullish bar we can create a new variable
here called green candles equals zero
and increment that variable
by one whenever this condition is met
now if i paste this into our plot save
my script we should be counting how many
green bars there were across the past 11
bars we could also turn these numbers
into user inputs so i could say look
back equals input dot integer
10 paste that in there and this will do
exactly the same thing so that is a for
loop in a nutshell let me show you two
other features we have to work with when
using for loops one way we could achieve
this same outcome is by using a continue
clause and now we'll be counting red
candles because every time a bullish
candle is detected in our for loop the
for loop will skip this loop and move on
to the next loop so if this condition is
not met and we do not continue then we
will increment our red candles counter
by one so if i save our script we should
be getting a different counter up here
now there we go now one last operator
keyword operator we have to work with is
the break operator and what this does is
break out of our for loop whenever this
condition is meant so essentially what
this will now do if i save my script is
it will count how many red bars plotted
onto my chart in a row and then whenever
a green bar is detected our loop will
exit so now when i save my code we are
now counting how many consecutive red
bars plotted onto our chart in a row
until a green bar is detected now one
last thing i want to bring to your
attention is that we can also use a for
loop to return a value much like a
custom function so if i change this to
say loop count is assigned our for loop
and i get rid of all this code and i
just put in our counter variable here if
we plot this loop count variable onto
the chart we should be getting 10
because our for loop is counting up to
10 and then returning that counter
variable and then we're assigning this
variable to whatever this for loop
outputs so now when i save my code we
should be getting 10 drawing there we go
and that is one of the way we can use a
for loop to return a value and that's
about all you need to know about for
loops good luck with your trading and
