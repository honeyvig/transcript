hey everyone welcome to simply learns
youtube channel in this session we will
learn how to add watermarks to our excel
documents but before we begin let me
tell you guys that we have daily updates
on multiple technologies so if you're a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for
latest technological trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn now without further
ado let's get started with our one point
agenda that is how to add watermark to
excel
now on my sheet you can see some data so
here we wanted to add some watermark
logo to your
excel spreadsheet so that it looks
genuine and worked by you right so
that's the overall idea of adding a
watermark now go to the insert window
and in the insert window go to the text
option
click on that select header and footer
once you select header and photo you can
see something on your screen like this
so in this box which is highlighted by a
cursor is where you're going to add the
picture on my top in the menu bar you
can see header and footer elements in
this select the picture element and it
will navigate to you to a different
option window since we are adding the
image from our local system select from
file or if you are adding from your bing
or any search window you can also add
that or onedrive as well but now let's
go with from file
it will directly navigate you to the
pictures folder in your local system so
here is my simply learns logo click on
it and select insert now you can see the
image is added in this format which is
ampersand and picture and you might
wonder where is the picture it is
actually present to view it click on any
cell in the spreadsheet and there you go
you can see it now you might be
wondering the image is a little towards
top and abnormally placed right so no
worries you can always you know format
your picture just press enter and
use enter to move your picture towards
the center of your data spreadsheet and
also there is another option of format
picture altogether here you can adjust
the height and width of your image by
you know increasing and decreasing width
or increasing and decreasing height
using the arrow marks also works and
apart from this there is another option
of picture formatting where you can
choose your image to be washing out
black and white grayscale or anything so
currently i'm going with automatic which
will automatically adjust the brightness
and you know everything for your image
it looks perfectly fine so click on ok
and there you go
right so now
this should be fine
right now everything is done and
everything is automatically saved if you
are having that auto save option on your
spreadsheet and let's go back to the
normal view from the header and footer
view click on the view and go to normal
you might be confused right where is the
logo it vanished did i have to save it
no it's already saved everything is fine
even the image is there but you cannot
see it in normal view to see it click on
file
click on print then you can see the logo
it will be present only on the printed
pages not on the normal view okay so
that's how you work with uh watermarks
in excel and that's how you can add and
customize your watermarks using excel
and with that we have come to an end of
