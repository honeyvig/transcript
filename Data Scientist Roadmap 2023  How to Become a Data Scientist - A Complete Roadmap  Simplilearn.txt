data is the new oil with organizations
losing nearly 15 million dollars
annually because of useless data trained
data science professionals adapt at data
cleanup and extracting valuable
information are always in demand simple
learn provides free courses on the
scalar platform to cater to Market
requirements for budding data scientists
today we will cover the roadmap our data
scientists must follow to get themselves
trained before they start their journey
in data science you will show how
skill-up courses can prepare you on a
fundamental level to make it easier for
you to tackle the intricate problems
later on in your career but before we
move forward make sure you subscribe to
the channel and have hit the Bell icon
to never miss an update so here is a
10-step plan to get you started in your
data science roadmap since the major
chunk of data science deals with numbers
and long spreadsheets having your maths
basic strong will provide a very strong
Foundation topics like linear algebra
Matrix Vector calculus classification
and regression are an absolute must if
you want your data Center's journey to
be as fluid as possible The Next Step
would be to learn statistics and
probability though these fall under the
mathematics
umbrella these two topics need to be
studied in depth since many of their
Concepts would be useful later when
designing reports based on thousands of
gigabytes of data once the match
sections are covered you can move over
to the computer screen and surprisingly
The Next Step would be to put your
programming skills at the Forefront data
structure and algorithms are very
important to master along with languages
like python or Java and even C plus plus
sometimes for Performance Based
optimizations most organizations in the
data science business tend to use python
as a main language working with numpy
and pandas libraries so learning these
Concepts should be a top priority in
your Learning Journey you can start by
taking up our python libraries for data
science course ensuring you do not miss
out on any framework that may be
essential in your data science roadmap
now once programming Basics are covered
you can take up machine learning because
machine learning is one of the most
important aspects of data science and
the most popular research topic among
academics breakthroughs in this area are
developed every year at the very least
one must understand the fundamental
techniques of supervised and
unsupervised learning this algorithms
can be implemented using several Python
and R libraries intermediate topics like
energy boost and post validation are
crucial cornerstones that will prepare
you for your data science role you can
learn all these topics and More in
simple learns machine learning skill up
course which will cover the basics of ml
or up to their Advanced sections The
Next Step would be to study deep
learning deep learning builds and drains
neural networks for structured
information using Frameworks like
tensorflow and Keras the Deep learning
for beginners course will cover the most
important topics like neural networks Pi
torch and tensorflow object detection
API among others once deep learning is
completed feature engineering should be
the next Milestone data scientists can
benefit from feature engineering by
minimizing the time it takes to collect
data variables helping them extract more
variables automation of feature
engineering will enable organizations
and data scientists to create more
accurate models next on the dock would
be natural language processing or NLP
simply learns online natural language
processing and text mining course
explains how machine learning techniques
can process enormous volumes of natural
language the course covers the
fundamentals of natural language
processing and text Mining and how to
begin applying these techniques in a
data science profession now that you
understand how to work around the data
The Next Step would be to present the
data in the most appealing way possible
this is where tools like power bi and
Tableau are helpful allowing data
scientists to understand what the data
is trying to show and make development
related inferences check out the free
introduction to data visualization
course where you will use tools such as
Tableau power bi XLR and python to
generate visualizations by the end of
the course you will have a clear-cut
understanding of how to derive
meaningful conclusions from data once
you master the art of extracting
valuable data you should focus on
deployment in most cases building a
model is not the end of the process in
data science deployment refers to
implementing a prediction model using
new data so learning how to deploy your
model efficiently will be the final step
in your journey to be a data scientist
now that you're well acquainted with the
free web data science you can start by
covering case studies on projects that
include multiple Frameworks like Keras
tensorflow Pi torch among others working
on case studies and creating your own
models will help you master these
Technologies and enable you to implement
them in varied situations so that wraps
up a 10-step plan for your data science
student you can find the links in the
description regarding the courses
mentioned in the video and like you
mentioned before all the courses are
free and will make you a part of a
simple learned Learners Network that can
further help your career thanks to a
completion certificate at the end of the
course let's get introduced to a simple
run app where you can easily access all
the skill-up courses directly on your
smartphone to the simpleton app you can
enroll in free online courses and
certifications that will take you to
your next big career break in data
science the interactive simple learn app
allows you to handle all aspects of an
Android course including the course
details content and quizzes I hope this
