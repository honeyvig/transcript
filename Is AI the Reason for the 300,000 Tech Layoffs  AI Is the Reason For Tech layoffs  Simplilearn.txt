Welch the former CEO of GE it's
sometimes called Rank and yank tech
companies have been bringing it back in
different forms as a means to keep
headcount in check during these new
years's efficiency and heading into

comments so let's get started let's
rewind to 2020 while the world was
grappling with lockdowns the tech
industry was booming Tech Stop seven
companies added a warping 3.4 trillion
in value with interest rates near zero
tech stocks sold and the companies went
on a hiring spree Amazon alone peaked at
1.7 million employees in
2021 it seemed like the good times would
never end but then the plot Twisted as
interest rates climbed and the capital
became harder to access Tech Giants hit
the panic button suddenly these massive
Workforce didn't translate to bigger
profits the result waves of layoff that
shocked the industry even Twitter which
is now called X saw 80% of its Workforce
either leave or get laid off yet
surprisingly the platform still runs you
know this is where you kind of start to
see this incredible leverage of what
these Tech platforms really have but
here's when it gets interesting AI the
buzzword of 2023 that's now having real
world World effects in 2024 job posts
mentioning generative AI have surged by
500% the demand from job Seekers of
these positions are staggering 6,000 per
increase every company in every industry
is scrambling to integrate AI but does
this mean AI is directly responsible for
these layoff the answer isn't just as
straightforward as you might think while
some companies site shifting praties
toward AI as a reason for cuts experts
caution against
oversimplification right now we don't
see that there's a big impact from AI in
these Tech layoff it's important to say
that it's very different than saying AI
tools are taking job so if it's not just
about AI what's really driving these
layoff and more importantly what does
this mean for future of tech jobs
despite the layoff tech stocks have been
on a tier the NASDAQ climbed 43% % in
2023 it's the best year since 2020 meta
formerly Facebook surged over
194% it's a bizarre Paradox Mass layoffs
coupled with soaring stock prices but
what's driving this seeming
contradiction the answer lies in a
fundamental shift in investor priorities
where growth was once a kink
profitability now wears the crown
instead of rewarding the growth that we
saw them all pursue years ago they are
now rewarding profit and so the layoffs
have seemed to be continued regrettably
it seems that layoffs are going to be
now normal but it's not just Tech other
sectors are following the suit UPS
announced 12,000 job Cuts media giants
like Paramount and NBC are slashing
positions even Banks like City group and
Morgan Stanley are trimming their
Workforce yet here's the kicker the US
economy added 3 lakh 53,000 jobs in
January 2024 far exceeding expectations
the unemployment rate a steady 3.7 so
are these layoff a sign of a deeper
economic shift or just a tech industry
reset to understand this we need to look
at the bigger picture that is the
covid-19 pandemic accelerated digital
transformation across all the sectors
companies that over hired during the
boom are now course correcting but
there's another Factor at play the rise
of AI and automation while AI isn't
directly responsible for most layoff
it's changing the skills companies need
jobs that can be automated are at risk
while demand for AI expertise is
skyrocketing AI is going to create a lot
more jobs as well but at the same time
there will be jobs that will be
automated so what does this mean for you
and your career the key takeaway in this
is adaptability is crucial the tech
landscape is evolving rapidly and the
skills and demand are changing just as
fast the tech industry's great reset is
just more than a series of layoff it's a
fundamental shift in how companies
operate and what skills they value while
it's just challenging time for many it's
also an opportunity for those willing to
adapt and grow remember the future
belongs to those who can harness the
power of AI while bringing uniquely
human skills to the table that's all for
