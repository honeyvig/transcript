hello everybody this is dr madhuri from
team mds conquer
so now we'll discuss about the
development of the face actually they'll
ask
individually i like development of the
palette or a development of the manga
law or a mandible
but sometimes they can ask like
completely you have to write about the
development of the face
so now we'll discuss very briefly what
to write when
a question like development of phase
will arise okay
this is the contents of this video like
starting the introduction to the
conclusion and references
uh which includes like prenatal
development
development of skull face palette tongue
maxillary mandible
tmj and survivory glands
so coming to the interaction usually
this human face begins during the fourth
week of our intra-time life
and palette development occurs in the
six to eight weeks whereas at the end of
the sixth week external phase is
completed
and the development continues in the
twelfth week with the completion of the
soft palate
so prenatal development includes three
successive phases
okay actually this development is
divided into 23 stages
i mean like complete development okay
but pre and three successive phases like
where the
germinal phase embryonic phase and fetal
phase
so this is very important for us there
is neural tube and germ layers
and this ah actually here the
artisan organs will differentiate after
the formation of
triploplast embryo okay then here we
will see this
ectoderm from the sector neuroplay
develops where
consists of neural folds and neural
group completely forms a neural tube
then from the mesoderm somites like
sclerotome myotome and dermatome will
develop
and rhombometers are important in the
formation of the head
this is the formation of the notocard
here you can see starting there is a
neural plate
then a neural group appears and a fold
which formation leads to formation of
neural crest cells and the neural tube
completely and here the entire notocard
is same
so you can represent this development in
the form of pictures with only a few
lines describing them okay
so head formation uh actually we i have
told that
rhombomedias help in the head formation
right so you you can see here there are
two types of rhombomir stromomiya one
andromeda two
andromeda one helps the connective
tissue of the phase formation
whereas rhomomir2 the first branchial
arch
then this tomatoium is called as a
future mouth
and it is bounded cranially by the
frontal eminence and quarterly by the
cardiac bulge
okay that which leads to the heart and
this is separated from the gut by a
bucco pharyngeal membrane
and in the formation of the neck it is
formed by the elongation of region
between this systematium and pericardium
this is because a series of mesodermal
thickenings called as pharyngeal or
branchial arches appear so this is
bronchiologists are very important
so you can see here this is the
stomatodium
and this is the frontal permanent
prominence which leads to the head
in baccopharyngeal membrane zagat
and the cardiac bulge and it is the
future cardiovascular system
and this pacco pharyngeal membrane
ruptures it 24 to 26 days
and coming to our important sub topic in
this
development of phase that is branching
arches so these arches
are actually there are six arches but
the fifth arcs will disappear and only
five will remain okay
then this pharyngeal arches are rod like
thickenings of mesoderm
present in the wall of the foregut this
arches are separated externally by small
clefts called as branchial grooves or a
ectodermal clefts
and on the inner aspect you can see the
small depressions which are called as a
branchial pouches or
endodermal pouches
you can draw this diagram representing
the pharyngeal arts like
first branch large second one third one
and fourth and fifth so this you can
draw the diagram
in the pharyngeal arteries
so this table is every very important
you can represent as it is
which is present in the table like what
is the first arch
and what are the derivatives of the
subheading should be what is the arch
for our derivatives of the first arch
muscles
of the arch and nerve of the earth so
these should be your subheadings
and these should be your contents okay
so the first arcs derivatives are
this chemicals cartilage incurs malleus
and spinomandibular ligament
these are the muscles of the first arch
and this is the nerve of the
first arch in coming to the second arch
these are the derivatives of the second
arch
these are the muscles of the second arch
and this is the
now of the second large and here if you
learn this table
even if they give like any other muscles
also you can directly
write the no supply directly because if
you learn this
group of muscles here which is supplied
by mandible now so if you
get a muscles of mastication answer then
you can directly write the nerve supply
like with mandible and also this table
is important
then third arch are derivatives
muscles and the now supply fourth arch
derivative muscles and the nerve supply
and the sixth are derived radius and the
nerve supply okay fifth arch is
disappeared so
hence it is not included in this table
then there are two terms called as
pharyngeal pouch and the cleft you can
see here this function remember two
things that's it
pouch is lined by the endoderm whereas
groove that is cleft it is
lined by the ectoderm you can simply
represent this diagram for the
pharyngeal pouch and the cleft
then starts with the development of
phase it is derived from the two process
that is frontal nozzle process
and the other structure is first
pharyngeal or the
mandibular arts so you can see here this
is the frontal process
and this is the maxillary process and
this is the multiplier process
this diagram you can draw for the phase
development so there are
ah you can draw a limited number of
diagrams with the important points okay
so here you can see this mandible
prominence
and this yellow color thing you can
color your diagrams also
so that this is a maxillary prominence
and this is the frontal process
and here you can see the median nasal
prominence
lateral nasal prominence and external
acoustic and
miatas and the external eo
then these mandibular arch consists of
two process that is
at the dorsal end maxillary process can
be seen like this
whereas if the ventral and mandibular
process is seen
then this lower lip mandibular process
of the two sides grow towards
each other and they will fuse and form
this
lower lip the upper lip
is formed by the maxillary process grows
and fuses initially then with lateral
nasal process followed by the median
nasal process so all these process
combine and form the upper lip
so the mesodermal basis of this lip is
formed by the frontal nozzle process
whereas the lateral part is formed by
the
maxillary process remember those points
you can see here the development of the
lip see this is the maxillary process
overgrows the frontal process
and here you can see this fused
mandibular process
and here you can see this maxillary
process fuses with the
lateral nasal process here and this is
the frontal nozzle process okay this is
the frontal nozzle max very process
lateral nasal process and the maxillary
process and this is the mandible process
you can draw any one of the diagram here
which representing all the processes
then coming to the cheeks this imaginary
process fuses with the median angle of
the developing eye
and which formation of nasal optic
furrow or the nasolacrimal
sulcus and this leaks are formed this
maxory and random blood processes
lateral to the stomatodium will fuse to
form the cheeks
then nose nose is formed with three
processes that is frontal nozzle process
medial nasal process and the lateral
nasal process
and there are called as olfactory
plaques and
remember in this slides only very
important points which you have to
mention in the examination are given
so this is sufficient if they give for
the development of the phase the frontal
olfactory placodes which are like
localized thickenings of the ectoderm
overlying the frontal nozzle process
and this pluckers will sink below the
surface to form
a horseshoe shaped ridge then this nasal
pits will have it two
arms that is median arm and the lateral
medial arm is the medial nasal process
where lateral
arm will form the lateral nasal process
this both the lateral and the medial
nasal process
fuse with each other and form the
external leads
so you can see here this is the nasal
plucode and this is the lateral nasal
process nasal pit
and the medial nasal process so this is
a line diagram where you can see
maxillary process
this is the eyes lateral nasal process
and the medial nasal process
in coming to the nasal cavities and it
is formed by the extension of the nasal
pit okay
then primitive palette it is a partition
between pit and the stomatodium
which is formed due to fusion of the
media line the lateral nasal
processes and this nasal sac have a
dorsal
orifice and the ventral orifice dorsal
orifice forms the nasal aperture
residential orifice from the external
needs and with they both dorsally expand
dorsally and
caudally and these all the nasal
cavities
ah and narrowing of the frontal nozzle
process
forms the nasal septum
so that completes the formation of the
nose then coming to the eye
lens placards are involved these are the
ectodermal thickenings present in the
ventrolateral to the brain
and later and cranial to the nasal
plaque so if
they will sink below the surface and
gets cut off from the surface of the
ectorum
then afterwards eyeball will balance
naturally forwards
and then eyelids are developed from the
folds of ectoderm and mesoderm
then coming to the external year here it
is formed around the first
ectodermal cleft and it is formed by the
fusion of
mesodermal thickenings
and this initially pinnable glycol to
the developing jaw
but during the enlargement of the
mandibular process this pin novel pushed
upwards and
backwards
so these are the developmental anomalies
of the year like anoshia
that absence in austria is that
complete i mean like fusion microstria
small ear
and auricular sinuses
so you can mention this developmental
anomalies also see
in any uh answer where if there are any
question if they ask about the
development
you have to mention the anomalies also
in the applied aspects
so coming to the paranasal sinuses this
ma
actually this maxillion spinoid sinuses
will develop before the birth
whereas enlargement of sinus and
enlargement of the facial skeleton
takes place future
and animal is includes like down
syndrome where there is non-development
of frontal and sphenoidal sinuses
upper syndrome whereas diminution or
absence of the sinuses
and presence of metabolic suture or
diminishing absence of frontal
nozzle sinuses can be seen
then coming to the development of pilot
it consists of three components that is
two palletal process of the maxilla
primitive valid formed from the frontal
nozzle process so this is the primary
palette
and these are the secondary palatal
shells which
finally leads the fusion of the parrot
so you can see here this inter maxillary
segment
is the flow chart i mean like you can
write like a sequence
the inter maxillary segment will give
rise to filter of the upper lip
median part of the maxillary bone in
sizes and triangular primary palette it
forms a triangular primary palette then
frontal section through the head
then it will forms like a vertical
position of the palatal shelves
on either side of the tongue then at the
7 to 5.5 week embryo showing horizontal
position of the palatal shells above the
tongue
you can see here you can represent this
diagram
and the last thing is a frontal section
of this
10 10-week embryo showing the fused
palatal shells
here okay these are the stages
how like in in the sixth week or seventh
week and the tenth week
if you can remember you can you can
include these points also
and one or two diagrams like you can
directly draw the tenth week diagram
then animal is includes like left
palette you can represent with the
pictures like unilateral cleft complete
electrical cleft lip and jaw and jaw
with unilateral cleft flip and anterior
palate
here the bilateral cleft lip bilateral
cleft of the posterior palate
and cleft palate combined with a
unilateral and period cleft so you can
represent these anomalies in the
diagrams
then other developmental disturbances
include like
i mean like of other all these things
like epstein pearls
epstein pearls bones nodules
high arts to palette marfan syndrome
clear cranial i mean like this median
palatal sister of epstein pearls and
bones nodules i adds to palette
can be seen this is the developmental
distance of palette
can be seen in in higher marfan syndrome
credo cradial disostosis krausen
syndrome progeria
turner syndrome and the upper syndrome
then these are the epstein pearls you
can see the junction
whereas in the mid palatine raphae
region you can see the bone snorines
and the development of the tongue coming
to development of the tongue this is
very important
and here you can see uh like anterior
two-thirds of the tongue
dial from the tubercle impair into
lingual cell swellings
posterior one-third develop from the
hypobranchial eminence
okay
so these are the anomalies of the tongue
like eyeglassia
microglossia microglossia physiotum and
angelo glossia
then coming to the development of the
skull here you can see like
in i mean this morphogenesis can be
blends into like neuro cranium plus
desmocranium
plus chondrocranium then phase wisdom
cranium and masticatory
operators it is a blend of morphogenesis
and growth of skull entities
so this kali is formed from the
mesenchyme surrounding the brain
and this mesenchyme from the sclero term
of the occipital somite help in the
formation of the base of the skull so
the base of the skull is from the
spiritual
whereas otic and nasal capsules take
part in forming the mesenchymal basis of
the
skull and this mandibular and maxillary
process
first prank which are related to first
branching art is closely related to the
developing skull
and these are the bones of the skull
which are completely formed in the
membrane
list and these are the complete bones of
the skull which are completely formed in
the cartilage
and partly cartilage and partly membrane
so you can include this easy table in
your answer
if they ask about development of the
face
then these are the anomalies of the
skull
like an anencephaly scaphocephaly
acrocephaly oxycephaly plagiocephaly and
hydrocephalus
so you can draw these diagrams also that
plagiocephaly oxycephalian
trigonocephaly
triangle shape enlarged microcephaly
and scaphocephaly inocephaly
and coming to the development of maxilla
it includes like prenatal development
and the post-natal development
okay develops by the intra membranous
ossification
and here anteriorly
i mean like this maxillary process of
the first arch
center of ossification will be like
posteriorly below the orbit towards the
zygoma
anteriorly towards the incisors
superiorly to form the frontal process
inferiorly to form the alveolar palate
angular plate
and partially to palatally to form the
heart palette
and the zygomatic or malar cartilage
that is secondary
cartilage helps in the formation of
zygomatic and allele process
then post natural development includes
two aspects that is shifting position of
the maxillary complex and
enlargement of the complex and this
postnatal development is because of
these mechanisms you can mention only
the names which is sufficient like
suture connective tissue proliferation
ossification
surface opposition resorption and
translation and this is
based on the principle of expanding v
so in this diagram you can see this
nasomaxillary complex
as emerges beneath the cranium
whereas this expanded v is the you can
see here expanded v
in the down growth of the and forward of
the maxilla
so you can draw this line diagrams
then mandible prenatal development
primary cartilages of megals cartilage
and
initially osteoarthritis at the
bifurcation of the inferior allerge
takes place
and the secondary cartilage includes
condylar coronoid and the symphyseal
cartilage and
this is also based on the expanding v
principle
and if you see in the postnatal
development this
both develops by the endocondor and the
intramembranous ossification
okay and this allele process and the
resolution
occur the iv aldolar process and
posterior
border of the ramus will develop after
the one year whereas this
uh distal superior surface of the ramus
condyle and lower water of the lateral
surfaces
will develop during the first year of
the life
and disturbances of the jaws that to
maxilla includes maxillary hypoplasia
treacher collins syndrome anhydrotic
ectodermal hyperasia
down syndrome and the cleft lip and
cleft palate
if you go over the distance of the jaw
in the mandible
these are on the list of disturbances of
the jaws
of the mandible which is important here
is the parry robinson syndrome
then development of the tmj here this
develops
between because of the mesenchyma
between the condylar cartilage of
mandible and squamous tympanic bone
they convert in india done strip of
misincome finally
leads leads break down and forms the
articular disc of the joint
developmental anomalies includes
ankylosis and functionless joint that is
mandibular mal development in coming to
the development of salivary glands this
includes formation of analog and
development of clan with
dichromatic branch duct differentiation
and early formation of the lobules and
canalization
and structural maturation and duct
differentiation these are the stages in
development of salivary glands
developmental anomalies includes
agencies hyperplasia atresia
aberrancy stephanie cyst anterior
lingual depression
so these are the references for the
development of the face
so this in this video i have given a
brief
idea of all the things which are
developed which are included in the
development of phase so if they ask
like broadly development of phase you
can include all these points which i
have covered in the video and few
diagrams and the tables like
bones of the skull and the and this
thing
pharyngeal pouches they are very
important so don't forget to include
these two tables when they give the
answers like development of face okay
thank you everyone have a nice day
