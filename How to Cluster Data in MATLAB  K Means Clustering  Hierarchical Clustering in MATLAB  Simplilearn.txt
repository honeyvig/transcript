do you know which technology is used to
classify the movie queries a search for
a movie will restore a web page that is
arranged into a category such as reviews
trailers stars and theater we can
classify this queries using clustering
which divides them into a subclusters or
subcategories creating an hierarchical
structure that allows you to analyze

is not done by the Matlab software
let me know your answer in the comment
section below
just quickly go through the agenda for
today's session
first we'll understand what is
clustering then we'll understand what is
hierarchical clustering after that we
will understand the difference between
clustering and hierarchical clustering
then we will understand the what are the
different types of hierarchical
clustering
followed by we'll see how to use them in
the real world then we'll understand how
to implement clustering in Matlab
followed by will learn how to create
hierarchical clustering at last we will
Implement both clustering and clustering
in platform
let's try to understand what exactly
clustering is clustering is a technique
used to group a similar data points
together based on their characteristics
or features in simple words grouping
unlabeled examples is called clustering
then what is hierarchical clustering
well
clustering is a method of clustering
data points into groups based on their
similarities or dissimilarities
in this method there is a tree like
structure created it is also called as
dendogram
where each data points is represent as a
leaf node and the cluster are
represented as a branches the tree is
not a single set of cluster but rather a
multi-level hierarchy where the
clustering is done one level and joined
as a clustered at the next level
have gotten basic understanding of
clustering an oracle clustering now
let's see the difference between
clustering and aortical clustering
clustering is a technique that involves
in the grouping of set of data points
into a cluster based on their similar
characteristics
hierarchical clustering specify
clustering algorithm that creates a
hierarchy of a clusters clustering does
not create an hierarchy of a cluster
instead it is a simple group of data
points into a fixed number of clusters
hierarchical clustering is used in a
dendogram showing the IRA
calculationship between the Clusters
clustering needs the number of clusters
to be specified ahead of time
hierarchical clustering does not
requires the number of clusters to be
determined
now it's time to understand the types of
hierarchical clustering there are two
types of hierarchical cluster algorithm
and devices
clustering is a clustering where each
object start its own clusters and its
progressively merge with its nearest
neighbor until all objects are in a
single cluster in divisive clustering
all the objects starts in a single
clusters and are progressively split
into a similar casters until each object
is in Old cluster moving further
let's know the use of clustering and
hierarchical clustering in real world
clustering in hierarchical clustering
are the popular techniques used in
various fields of data analysis pattern
recognization data visualization and
many more for example let's first
consider email segmentation clustering
is also used image processing to
separate the image into a multiple
segments or regions this is useful for
tasks such as object detection image
compression and image segmentation and
the second usage is medical research
clustering is used in medical research
to analyze the patient data and identify
the subgroups of the patients with
similar medical conditions this helps
the researchers to identify the risk
factors develop treatment plans and
personalize a treatment for individual
patients and the one more popular usage
of clustering is social networking
analysis hierarchical clustering is also
used in social networking analysis to
identify the communities or groups of
individuals with a similar interest or
behavior this helps the resources to
understand the social dynamics identify
the key influences and analyze the
information diffusion now let's
understand how to create clustering in
Matlab the basic step to create
clustering in Matlab first is to load
your data load your data into a Matlab
using any of the supported file formats
such as CSV matte or txt or any other
the next step is to pre-process your
data previous the data by removing any
missing or irrelevant values and
normalize your data if required and the
third step is to choose the clustering
algorithm choose a suitable clustering
algorithm based on the characteristics
of your data and the objects that you
are analyzing the common clustering
algorithms includes k-means hierarchical
clustering and many more and the fourth
step is to set a parameter set a
parameter of a chosen clustering
algorithm such as the number of clusters
distance Matrix and the clustering
method and the last step is to perform
clustering and visualize the result use
the clustering functions in the Matlab
to perform the clustering on your data
and visualize the result of clustering
using the plots and the graphs and helps
them to interpret the results now let's
understand how to create a radical
clustering the first step is to load
your data
you need to load your data into a matrix
format where the rows represent the
observation and the column represent the
variables and the second step is to
choose the distance Matrix and the
leakage method
select the distance Matrix and the
leakage method that suits your data and
the analysis that you want to perform
the next is to calculate the distance
Matrix
use the predest functions to calculate
the distance Matrix between the all the
observation in your data
the fourth is to create the clickage
Matrix
use the leakage functions to create a
leakage Matrix that defines the
hierarchical clustering the inputs to
the functions that are distance Matrix
and the chosen leakage method and the
last one is to plot the dental graph use
the dendrogram functions to visualize
the hierarchical clustering as a dental
graph now let's Implement clustering and
hierarchical clustering in the platform
first let's Implement clustering in
Matlab for that first I'll load a data
set
I'll use an function called load and
data set nav
I am using fissure
Iris
dataset
you can see we have means and species
which is of 150 plus 4 Double Matrix and
species is a 150 cross one cell Matrix
now what I'll do I'll
take a variable called Data
and
normalize means
into entire column
and the second row till
the end
close the bracket end with the semicolon
now we have a data of 150 cross three
double Matrix
now what I'll do I'll normalize this
data data is equal to I'll use a
function called normalization
or normalize within the square brackets
I'll pass the variable called
data
into the semicolon
now
I'll take a variable K and Define the
number of clusters as we know in
clustering we have to define the number
of clusters before we perform clustering
next
we can see we have a variable K which as
a 3 as we have defined the number of
clusters is
3.
now I'll take one more variable called
outputs and in that I will Define a
static
set
static step set which will create the
statistic operations of a structure I'll
give a two variable called
display
and final and I'll just close the
bracket and it will semicolon
now to perform clustering we are using K
means algorithm in this for this data
set
to take the values or two variable
called index and a c
which is equal to I am calling K means
algorithm using and
variable called K means
and within the bracket I'll give data K
clustering
[Music]
element and then I'll give the
distance
after that I'll give the distance
and I'll just also mention the
replicates
and I want five replicates within the
code Square Dimension and I want the
fire application and I'll mention it as
Phi and then it codes I'll give the
options and at last I'll call off
variable which I have created the static
set of operations or structures
and we can see as we have already told
we have fire replicas replicate one two
three four five and respective
iterations we have total number of
distance between the replicants and
regulations and we can also see the best
total sum of the distances is
94.6833 we also got the best total sum
of the distance now it's time to
visualize this data in the form of
graphs before that I'll just clear my
screen
now we will visualize this data first of
all call a function called
figure then
after getting back to the command prompt
I'll just keep I'll use scatter plot
I'll use scatter off
data
with the respect to the first
row and again data
with respect to this second
close
and this size is 10
with respect to ideas and I want my
scatter plot to be filled
and and close the semicolon
and
enter now I'll just say
hold on
please hold on
foreign
I will also plot C
that is C
C of
entire row
comma 1
and same it as C or at least Capital C
of
entire thing comma second one
and I'll mention all the parameters
Marcus oh sorry I just forgot to
mention the marker size
and give it as
markers size
and I'll specify it
it should be inside the quotes specify
the marker size as 15.
comma
and I'll just specify the line
width
should be
three
floors with a semicolon
and using Legend function
I am labeling them as
cluster 1
again same
cluster 2
comma
cluster 3 close the brackets let these
CB caps
to maintain the uniformity
and then I'll
so create the center
rods
close the codes and the comma
Mark the location
through the codes comma
and last end of the semicolon
oh I just made a mistake in the spelling
of Legend I just run it once again
as you can see we have got this graph in
our data set we have a three different
flowers of different characteristics one
flower is represented as in blue color
one is represented in yellow color one
is representing purple color as we can
see the into marks are the Clusters that
are the similar characteristics that
three flowers which has and cluster one
is a similar characteristics that the
flower one has
like this you can perform clustering to
any different data set that you want
using Matlab now let's see how to
perform hierarchical clustering
first we'll perform ironical clustering
by creating our own data set before we
move on I'll just quickly clear my
screen
and clear all the variables using clcn
clear option
as I said earlier we will perform Oracle
clustering for two different data sets
first we will create our own data set to
create or to load our own data set we
will take a variable called Data
which is equal to
Rand of 50
cross 5 Rand is in variable which will
create a random integers from 50 to 5.
as we can see we have variable data
which has 50 cross 5 elements
now we have to choose the distance
Matrix and the leakage method
for that what I will do is I will take a
variable name as
distance
metric
and we will use the famous distance
metric that is euclidean
semicolon
and for leakage
underscore
method
[Music]
compete
copyright copy and with the semicolon
now we have to calculate the distance
method and the calc and then I will
calculate the leakage metric for first
we will calculate the distance metric
that is
again I'll use the keyword called
distance which is equal to we will use
the function called pdist
inside that will pass a data
comma
and also will pass the
distance Matrix function and then width
bracket and semicolon
now again I will do the same for the
leakage Matrix that is we will do again
we'll take the
keyword variable called linkage and we
will just use a function
linkage
within the bracket will will pass the
distance
and the
linkage
method function and close into the
semicolon
as we have see you can see we have
calculated both linkage and distance
Matrix now
at last we'll just plot the dendrogram
using the function called
dentogram
which in that will just pass the
h
yeah this is
you can see we have got the diagram as
we discussed hierarchical clustering
forms a tree like structure which is
called endogram we can see this graph
looks like a tree and this sub graphs
look like its branches
like this you can perform Oracle
clustering for your own data sets now
it's time to see how to perform anorical
clustering for data set or loading the
other data set from a Google or kaggle
anywhere before that let me clear all
the figures
and clear my screen and workspace
to perform hierarchical clustering for
loading data set I have already
downloaded the data set called digit.csv
and imported using the import option
you can also download any data set that
you want and use the import option to
import your data set and it will be
saved in the file section
first we will load a data set using load
digit.csv
semicolon as we can see we have a
variable called digits created with the
data set of
1797 cross 65 Matrix
now we will just calculate the distance
using the variable as we used before
called distance
which is equals to we use the function
called pdist inside that we will
pass the our data set that is digits
and
call our
famous distance calculator that is
utility using
[Music]
and just close the brackets and the
semicolon and press enter
as we you can see we have a distance
variable created here next again the
same way we will calculate
the leakage
which is equal to
foreign
function
inside that we will pass the distance
[Music]
and
here we will give the average
Now using the dendrogram we will just
plot
see leakage
or just
close and in semicolon and Justice enter
as you can see we have got an endogram
graph as we know the article clustering
forms a tree like structure which is
called a diagram this is the
gendrendogram which has been created for
data set now getting back to the command
prompt now we will Define the cluster
number and then plot this using the
scatter plot
before that I'll just clear my screen
and now I'll give num underscore
cluster is equal to 3 into semicolon
inter
now we have the number of clusters which
has been defined now we will Define the
cluster assignments
which is equal to
cluster function within that
I'll pass the
leakage
and then the
Max cluster
and the number of clusters that we have
defined
and run
now I have to plot this for that I am
calling
figure
function
and then scatter plot
do some scatter
off
first one is a cluster assignments
versus the num clusters
the size should be of 20 and
it should be
I want it should be filled
mention it as failed
underneath the semicolon net
as you can see the graph we have got our
scatter plot as per the our cluster
assignments and the num cluster that is
the number of clusters we have specified
as three and we have got a maximum
clustering points of our data set
like this you can perform hierarchical
clustering and clustering for any
desired data set that you want
with this we have reached the end of
this session today we have learned what
is clustering understood what is
hierarchical clustering what are the
real world uses of clustering analytical
clustering we also learned steps to
implement clustering and analytic
clustering at last we implemented
clustering analytical clustering for
different data sets
