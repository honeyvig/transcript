hey everyone i am pepper khandelwal and
i welcome you all to simply learns
youtube channel in this session we will
talk about circular linked list we shall
begin our session by introducing a
circular linked list
then we will try to implement it in the
code editor after that we will try
various operations on them like
insertion and deletion
finally we will sum up what we have
learned in this session
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell icon so you never
miss an update from simply learn
so without any further ado let's get
started with introduction to circular
linked list
a circular linked list is a linear data
structure made up of nodes
it is like a singly linked list except
its last node points at the head node
these nodes consist of two parts data
and reference to next pointer these
nodes can be traversed using the next
pointer
now let's try to implement it in the
code editor we will start by creating
nodes to create a node we need a class
node
we will define its members as public
into data
and node pointer
next
now let's write a function to insert a
node at the beginning
void push
we will use arguments as a pointer to
node pointer had
and enter data
we will define a node
newnode
equals to new
node parenthesis
star head
now we will put in the data into a new
node
since we are inserting at the beginning
of the linked list that's why this new
notes next should be the head pointer
if linked list is not null then set the
next of the last node as head
file
next
is not equals to
head
temp
is equals to
temp
arrow next
now then
next
is equals to new node
else
new node
next
is equals to
new node
star head
equals to new node
now let's write a function to print this
linked list
void
print list
node
star head
node
star temp
is equals to head
if
add
is not equals to
null
then
do
see out
damp
while
amp
is not equals to
head
this condition is important to stop this
loop so that it doesn't go infinitely
now let's go to the main block
let's initialize this list as empty
node star head
equals to null
now let's insert some nodes in this
linked list
push
ampersand
ampersand head
comma 11
head
comma
5
now this linked list looks like
5
11
9
2
then it will again go back to 5.
now let's try to print this
c out
circular
list
now let's try and execute this
as you can see we have successfully
created our first circular linked list
let's get back to our slide we have now
introduced the circular linked list now
let's discuss some of the operations we
can apply on a circular linked list
we can perform two operations on a
circular linked list
first up insertion
we can perform insertion at three
different situation at the beginning at
the last and at a specific position
after a node
next up deletion we can perform deletion
at the three different situations
first up at the beginning at the last
and at a specific position after a node
let's discuss these in detail first up
insertion at the beginning
we have to give the first node's address
to the new nodes next pointer to execute
this
next up insertion at the end
we have to give new nodes address to the
last node's reference pointer
next up insertion at a specific position
we will change the previous node's
reference address to the new node's
address and the new node's reference
pointer to the next node's address
now let's try these operations in a code
editor
so far we have implemented a linked list
using classes
now let's try to implement it using
structures
we will start by creating a struct
node
with its element as int data
and structure
next
now we will write a function which can
only insert a node to an empty list
struct
node
star
add
empty
new data
now since this function is only for the
empty list so we will have to check if
the link list is empty or not
if
last
is not equals to
null
then we will return
last
now let's create a node dynamically
struct
node
start temp
equals to
struct
load
star
malloc
size of
structure
we will copy this statement because we
will need it in the future functions
we will assign the data to this new node
temp
data
is equals to
neutral
data
last
is equals to temp
now we will create the link
to that we will use last
next
is equals to last
since we are in an empty list so the
first node will always point to itself
return
start
node
start
we are creating a function to insert at
the beginning of the linked list
struct
node
star
add
again
as argument we will use struct
data
if
last
is equals to null
then we will return
empty
last
data
now we will create a node
dynamically
have already copied the statement for
the ease
now we will put in the data
data
next
is equals to
last
next
last
next
is equals to
return
last
now we will write a function to insert a
node at the end
start
node
star
add
and
and
data
if
last
equals to equals to null
then
return
add empty
last
comma
data
now we will dynamically create a node
and put in the data
temp
data
equals to data
next
is equals to
last
next
now last next
is equals to
temp
and last equals to
temp
return
now we will write a function to insert a
node after a specific node
so struct
node
star
add
after
struct
node
star
last
item
this item is a node after which we have
to insert the node
if
last
equals to equation null
then return
struct
node
star
temp
comma
star p
p
is equals to
last
next
now do
if
equals to
item
equals to
we will dynamically create a node here
temp
is equals to
struct
node star
malloc
size of
structure
now we will put in the data so temp
data
is equals to data
temp
next
is equals to
next
a p next
is equals to
temp
if
e is equals to last
last
is equals to temp
return
last
next
while
p
is not equals to
last
text
see out
item
not
present
in the list
return
last
now we will write a function to print
this list
void
print
list
struct
node
star lost
star p
now if
last is equals to null
then
see out
list
is empty
and return
else
we will point to the first node of the
list
so p is equals to
last
text
to traverse the list we will use do
while loop
so do
c out
data
is equals to
p next
while
e
is not equals to
last
text
now
let's write a code for the main block
we will start with an empty list
struct
node
star
last
supposed to
none
now last is equals to
add
empty
last
comma
six
last equals to
add begin
last
comma
4.
last
equals to
add
begin
last
comma two
last comma
12
last
equals to
add
after
last
comma
10
comma
4.
list
let's execute this
as you can see we have created the
linked list in the correct order
let's get back to our slides
now let's talk about deletion
first up deletion at the beginning
we have to change the first node's
address to the null to execute this
next up deletion at the end
we have to change the second last node's
address
to null to execute this
next up
deletion at a specific position
we will change the previous node's
reference address to the next node's
address
now let's try these operations in the
code editor
let's get started with creating a node
to create a node we need a class
node
we will declare its members as public
and data
node pointer
next
now we will write a function to insert a
node at the beginning of the list
void
push
a pointer to the node pointer header
and new data
now let's create a node and make head as
next of it
load
star
node
equals to
new
node parenthesis
let's put in the data
new
node
data
is equals to new data
and new node
next
is equals to
head
if linked list is not null then set the
next of the last node
as the first node
if
star head
is not null
then they will find the node before head
and update next to it
so node star
temp
is equals to star head
while
next
is not
equals to head
temp is equals to
temp
next
temp
next
equals to
new node
else
new node
next
is equals to
new node
star head
is equals to
new node
now let's write a function to delete a
given node from the list
so
void
delete
node
its argument is a pointer to the node
pointer
add
and
ent key
now if linked list is empty then we will
simply return it
if
starhead
is equals to
null
then return
otherwise
if
header
data
is equal to key
and
add
next
is equals to head
then
free
add
and
add
is equals to null
return
now
node
last
is equals to
star head
comma star d
now if head is to be deleted
then
star head
data
is
equal to
key
then
while
last
next
equals to
star head
then
last is equals to last next
now we will point the last node to the
second node of the list
now we will free this head
our
head
equals to
last
next
now if either the node to be deleted is
not found or the end of the list is not
reached then
while
the last
next
is not equals to
head
and
last
next
data
is not equal to key
and last equals to
last
next
if note to be deleted was found
then
if
last
next
data is equals to key
then
d is equals to
last
next
and
last
next
is equals to
these next
now we will free
d
or else
c
out
no such
key
found
you
now let's write a function to print this
list
void
print list
node star
head
node
star
temp
is equal to
head
f
head
is not null
do
see out
temp
data
amp
is equal to
next
while
temp
is not equals to that
see out
now let's write a code for the main
block
we will start by empty list
so note star
head
equals to
null
now we will push
ampersand head
push
ampersand head
comma
five
push
ampersand head
comma
seven
push
ampersand head
comma
eight
and push
ampersand head
comma 10
now we will print the list before any
deletion operation
see out
list
before
deletion
list
head
now let's delete
add
let's delete seven
see out
list
after deletion
print list
add
let's execute this
as you can see our deletion function is
working perfectly
let's get back to our slides
at last let's sum up what we have
learned in this session
first up we have recognized circular
linked list as dynamic data structures
next the circular linked lists offer
faster insertion and deletion operation
next a circular linked list are
unidirectional in nature
that is we can only traverse it in one
direction
finally a circular linked list traversal
is quite tricky as we have to stop the
loop as soon as we revisit the first
node
otherwise it will traverse it
indefinitely
