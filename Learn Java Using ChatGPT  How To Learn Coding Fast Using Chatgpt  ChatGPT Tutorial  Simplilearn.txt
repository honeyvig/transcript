subscribe like and comment
below dive into the link in the
description to FastTrack your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back so before we jump into the demo
part here is a quick info for you if you
want to switch careers with AI NL then
try giving simply Lear postgraduate
program in Ai and machine learning from
P University in collaboration with IB
this course teaches in demand skills
such as machine learning deep learning
NLP compter Vision reinforcement
learning generative AI prompt
engineering chat GB and many more so
don't forget to check out the course
link from the description box and pin
comment so let's get started so this is
our chat GPT screen so here first I will
write give me a
monthly basis plan to learn Java
from beginner to sorry to advanced
level okay press enter so it will give
something like see on month one first
getting started with Java basics in this
you can love learn introduction to Java
and then oops concept then in month two
you will uh learn collection Frameworks
then exception handling and file input
output then in month three Advanced Java
topics then in fourth month Advanced
Java concept and Frameworks like Java
Frameworks web development with Java
then in fifth month Advanced topics and
project work like this you can ask tgbt
for monthly basis plan so now what I
will do here right so this is looking
little bit tough so what I will do I
will write here using the
above monthly
plan now give me a
weekly plan to learn Java okay so it
will give me weekly plan from this plan
okay so in week wi what I will do
introduction to Java Basics setup
development and first you have to
install jdk Java jdk okay Java
development kit right into your ID then
start with variables data type and
operators then day three then this then
week two then week three then week four
like this then again I will write here
let me copy it from here okay and paste
it here so I will write using the above
weekly plan now give me
daily basis plan to learn Java right now
I have a day one like days plan daily
BSIS plan day one day two day three day
four so it is more easier to focus on
right so this is your okay number of
days 27 right fine so now you can follow
your schedule as per this to learn Java
so now what I will do I will ask here
explain
day one
Concepts
briefly okay so on day one you will set
up your development envirment your Java
programming here's a brief explanation
what is development environment setup
will install the Java development kit
jdk which includes this this this then
about what is jdk then ID integrated
development envirment installing jdk
then
explain me day to
briefly explain spelling is
wrong okay on day two Java history is
there basic syntax okay see variables
here data set types are variables are
used to store data in program and they
can hold different types of values like
this okay and okay first let's see here
something if you want like see day three
dive into control flow statements IFL
switch so we can directly write here
please
explain me okay what was that control
flow
statements using
example okay so it will first it will
tell you what is control flow statement
control flow statement Java used to
control the flow of execution in a
program based on certain condition right
so there are three types of control flow
ifls
switch statement and loop statement okay
see if else statement plus the example
okay so there are commments also for
your better understanding okay right see
if else then switch then switch example
okay so this is a syntax this is an
example Loop then again syntax this is
an example Loop while loop okay so see
how much easy to learn Java using chat
GPD you can ask anything and it will
give you so let's see one more which one
okay okay okay so I will write oops
concept okay let's see class is and
object okay
explain
classes and objects in Java using
example okay so in Java classes and
objects this is this this this is a
syntax of classes and objects so this is
an example for what my class see it's
using classes and what are the objects
and classes you can learn from here an
object is an instance of a class it's
created based on the blueprint defined
this this this this right so this is how
you can learn any function in Java right
whatever your function name is just type
it and say it to explain Okay so so
after completing these function so we
can move on to practice some basic
programming question like how to find
prime number or fibon series like this
okay so I will write here give me code
to find prime
number
numbers in Java okay so this is your
Java code to find prime numbers see this
is too easy
okay if you want to explain it ex you
can write here explain me this
code okay see it will explain you right
see it's break down see here you can see
let's break down the code step by step
this much you can learn this is the main
method of program it first def find the
variable lower bound and upper bound see
this is how you can learn easily right
let's see one more give me code
for fibon
Series in Java and you can learn any
language from this any programming
language using CH okay so this is your
fabon Series right and you can ask him
to explain fine so now it's come to the
project so I will write here based
on topics we
covered till now give me some
project
suggestions suggestions on
Java okay so it will suggest you some
project okay so you can build simple
calculator application you can build
student management system you can build
invent management system so these are
some basic Java projects you can create
and you can add into your Java projects
list or in GitHub you can add or in
resume you can okay let's make too list
fine so give me
code
of too
list
project okay so here is simple
implementation of to list in Java using
Java FX for the graphical user interface
right so this is how you can create any
project and you can learn any project
okay you can ask him to explain you can
ask chj to explain this particular
project okay so now what you can do you
if you want to learn more about Java so
you can go to YouTube Simply learn you
can search as
Java okay so you can learn Java from
