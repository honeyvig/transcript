hi winners this is dr srikanth from team
mds conquer
now i'll be having a talk over dental
histology
so i'll be covering uh
as much stuff as possible within this
limited time but make a note
your dental pulse synopsis and the pp
book stuff is mandatory and i hope you
have done it
and i want you to glance that at least
like one hour
once you're done with this video make
sure
histology is again a topic where you
need to revise
okay because logic based application
based questions will be very very less
so
the pic memory based has an option so
memory based subjects
should be revised in the last five days
so let's start
so this is not basically from dental
histology but it is basically an area
of choice that most of the purpose
certainly speak that is
taken from your philips textbook okay so
they can ask you the content okay they
can ask you the water content is the
question that is given
so check whether they are going to ask
it as
per volume or pervert so dentin and an
animal i have given
then organic content organic content and
water
so if water you can simply remember an
aml
weight volume and dentin weight volume
so if they're asking water it's going to
be 1
6 and it's going to be 10 22 okay
and i hope you can manage that in
organic or organic content which is a
well familiar question
the next goes is uh i mean uh
i mean once they have asked this
question so
what is this this is the percentage of
wet weight composition
of an animal okay so the water content
in the secretary stage is five and the
maturation is one so the water content
is decreasing
from the initial phase to the last phase
whereas the mineral content is
increasing and the protein content is
decreasing so this
this is very very important
the next goes are the underlying stuff
just go through the underlying stuff at
the surface the modulus of elasticity is
higher
the hardness is more on
dentino enamel junction okay the
hardness is more on dentinal enamel
junction elastic
modulus of velocity is higher at the
surface and
the specific gravity values are
important of course 2.8 is for enamel
2.8 2.2
is for your dentin and 1.53 is for your
nitrous oxide
saliva is 1.008
the specific gravity all these values
are important to make a note we have
so many tables related to specific
gravity of all the things which are
important for examination of your pp
books
and i hope you are done with that okay
so electric
uh the temperature resistance they can
ask you the temperature resistance value
and the electric resistance value they
can ask so please do make a note of this
and okay semi-permeable memory an animal
is a semi-permeable membrane permitting
the passes of through a few materials
okay
that is 14c labeled urea or iodine etc
so please do make a note of this
then goes the chemical content 96
percentage of inorganic content four
percentage of organic content
two main groups that is amelogenins and
non-emelogens amylogenes are low
molecular weight
accounts ninety percent is the accounts
high percentage but they are low
molecular weight
they are rich in hp gl
h p g
l non-amylosionins are high molecular
weight and the oculus 10 percentage
and they are rich in gas g
a yes i know you're very clear
so this formula is a regularly asked
question i don't know why
so please do make another structure of
hydroxyapatite is hexagonal i hope
most of them are very familiar
uh the next comes is the hydroxyapatite
center core or
c axis of hydroxyl ions around which the
calcium and the phosphorus ions are
arranged in the form of triangles and
during the formation the magnesium can
be replaced
replaces the magnesium replaces the
calcium and
carbonate okay so please do make it a
during the formation
magnesium can replace the calcium and
carbonate can replace the
hydroxyl ion that's that's a very
important thing to be noted and this is
an important point to add the core of
the
crystals are rich in magnesium and
carbonate
okay and make a node ah this is a dry
weight content the major content in the
enamel structure is not calcium it is
oxygen that is 43.4 percentage
and followed by the calcium that is 36
percentage and followed by that
phosphorus it is seventeen point seven
percent major content is
oxygen don't get confused this is a this
is a big trap
and next goes is the ph regulation
during the enamel formation
so please do go through this contents
mainly this this is an area
of focused okay how this ph is going to
differ during the
and of course that you need to make a
note about the definition of buffering
capacity of the saliva and also
already discussed buffering capacity is
important in maintaining the ph levels
in the saliva and plaque
and and the buffering capacitive saliva
is
main one which maintains the oral
hemostatism and making what
the buffering capacity is the milli
moles
of naocl or hcl per ml
required to cause a change of
change of one unit change of a unit in
the ph value so this is the millimole of
either as either acid hcl or either base
naohcl
that is added per ml of saliva to change
it ph
by a normal value that is what the
buffering capacity
so the three buffering capacities which
are very very important that most
important buffering capacity is the
bicarbonate buffering
capacity the second most important
buffering capacity is the phosphate
buffering capacity
which is contributed to some extent when
there is
low saliva flow and you have low saliva
flow
this bike or this phosphate buffering
capacity is coming is going to come into
existence
the third system of buffering capacity
is the protein system
it occurs in the lower ranges of ph
that is the buffering capacity of saliva
is due to the macromolecule containing
h bonding systems and the next course is
you can identify the blood group of an
individual by taking the salivary
samples that's an important point to be
added
and you can know the or monitor the
progesterone levels to find the
ovulation time in the females
and of course the you can find the na
and k
plus ratio in the saliva that helps in
diagnosing the
diseases like additions disease and and
the cushing stasis
do make a note of this hormonal levels
your ins levels of testosterone insulin
and steroids can be determined in saliva
too and of course h pyrulate
which is the main cause that culprit for
the peptic ulcer can also be diagnosed
by using saliva of of course uh
urea's test is the best test to identify
this
but you can identify the h pylori by
using
some sort of things in saliva also the
biopsy of the minor salivary glands of
the lip
very commonly asked question related to
the zorgon syndrome
and do make a note of these composition
parameters that is the
volume of saliva or you can like they
can ask you gm
the immunoglobulins are represented in
the syllabus predominantly is ig
a okay iga immunoglobulin that is the
dimer form of ig immunoglobulin which
has j
chain j chain is present in the i g
m and i g a okay it holds
5 five five single units of igm it holds
two single units of ig and
most of them you know about this urea is
present uric acid is present
okay so you have all these growth
factors and do make a note of these
values
regularly i mean need is not much
focused on memory based stuff according
to two zero to zero
but we have to get prepared for
everything
warner glands these are the serious
survivory lands we have already
discussed like different types of glands
and
what is their contribution it is serious
or mucus are mixed or predominantly
something we have discussed everything
on the group
just go back and check those pics or the
other notices that are posted on it
and do make you know the lingual life is
very specifically lipase is not secreted
by saliva
it's lingual lipids which is secreted by
saliva and it's very specific to warn up
in our clients and it is innovated by
the
close of pharyngeal now do make a note
of this serous and mucus
cells and their diagram based things
okay they can ask you such questions
nowadays
microscopic diagram based questions are
seen very familiar in 2020 neet exam
and of course we can encounter a few
more in 2021 which is going to be on
december 16th
the next comes is the difference between
the microsoft by
by by learning these differences it is
very easy to identify the diagram based
questions so please go through
all these lines which are underlined
which are very very very very important
examination point of view
then of course you have a question on
this in 2020 neet exam and it's the most
familiar
which is common repeat not repeated in
1819 but
it's a question that is given in 2017
and of course with a twist that is added
in 2020.
so what is this what is this uh like
first of all it is interregulated tax
which opens into
stride attacks and open center actually
reduct okay
so what changes the regular lacquer
saliva concentration this was given okay
this was given right
so this was given in 2020 need and of
course the lining
you have a low cubital cells here you
have a tall column in our cells here
you have a pseudostratified columnar
epithelium two
stratified squamous epithelium here and
of course you know the smallest is this
the biggest is this the intermediate is
this
so there are a few other things that you
have to make a note myo epithelial cells
uh they are present at the periphery of
the duct they are absent here
they are absent here okay so please do
add such
such important things which can be asked
in the
examination point of view then comes the
difference between the different glands
and this is the table
taken from the textbook very important
now michael scotland disappears at 24th
week whereas your periodic land is four
to six
submandibular is six weeks and
sublingual is eight to twelve weeks
and coming to the type of secretion it
is serious secretion it is
zero mucous secretion and it is mucoid
secretion coming to the contribution
mass submandibular is going to
provide the major contribution that is
70 percentage and uh
peridot is 25 and five it is okay the
largest gland is periodic land but the
major contribution is by the
sublingual and the ducts which opens it
2017 question
okay so these are the most common things
where where the ducts are going to open
is the most common questions so please
do check it
uh when coming to the capsule capsule is
very thick and well developed here
capsule is thinner absent it is thinner
option and coming to the nerve
innervation
please do make a note of the nerves here
the facial nerve for the sub
mandibular facial know for the
sublingual
and do make you know the blood supply
the lymphatic drainage and everything
lysozyme is very predominant in the case
of your
submandibular okay and when you're
talking about the intercollective ducts
are
almost option but rarely seen in the
case of the sublingual
mls activity is more this is a question
that is given previously in one of the
aims examination
when you take when you take food of rich
carbohydrate mls is going to play a very
vital role right
so mls activity is mainly concerned with
the period
when compared to any other type of
glands okay so please do make a note of
these
things or they're gonna ask you this
question very familiar easily asked
cusp of caribbean where it is present
okay it's the fifth cast for the
smallest curse it is present lingual to
the
mesolingual cause for the maxillary
first molar
and coming to this uh yeah of course
these are the blood capillaries uh blood
capillary systems which are present in
the body
the first one is fenestrated capsules
the second one is continuous
the third one is discontinuous fourth
one is tight and first and second types
are most common in the case of your
dental
these are present in the human body all
the four types are present in the
human body when you're talking about the
dental pulp the first and second that is
the fenestration capsules and the
continuous capsules are most common in
the
dental pulp and coming to the enzymatic
hectic nowadays
you can see 2020 need has lots of
questions on engines
i mean most of them are related to
general medicine and physio part but
of course they can ask questions in this
particular area also
okay so which cells how which
activity more is a regularly asked
question for example
if you talk about the odentoblast and
odentocytes you have
alkalize alkaline phosphatase which is
more active
class they cause resorption you have
acidic phosphates that is more active
right and similarly class will have more
cytochrome oxidase and will have more
succinct dehydrogenase
so please do make a note of all these
things
which can be asked in the examination
and the next comes is the accessory
canals uh how the axillary canals form
that is a break in the
break or i mean like trap entrapment of
the vessels blood vessels during the
foundation okay so where you can see
accessory channels
so endodontically what are the
importance of accessoricals these are
the areas
where you have this connection between
the indoor and perio leading to
endoperiolesions
and these are the areas which has to be
cleaned properly because your irrigation
systems were not well developed
to reach these areas and to remove the
irritants or the bacterials or the
bacterial products in these areas
so it's going to be very difficult to
treat and the remaining bacteria may
cause the reinfection
causing poor prognosis so coming to the
apical foramens uh
the main important thing is ethical
foramen size in the case of maxilla 0.4
and the mandible is 0.3 sometimes you
have
two to three splitted epicol foramens
the entire area is called as an apical
delta
the functions of the pulp the pulp has
induction function formatted function
nutritive function
protective sensory and defensive
reparatory and the primary
function of the pulp is formation of
dentist okay formative function is the
primary function of the pulp which helps
in the formation of dentin
the dentin is formed first followed by
you you have that animal the first layer
of dentin is formed by the pulp
so it is most important step required
in the formation of a dentition okay so
the next comes is the histological
layers of the pulp that is odento
plastic layer
uh cell free zone of relay and rich zone
other names of the rich zone pulp core
the central part of this
cell cell free zone please do make a
note approximately 40
microns thickness it is also called a
cell poor zone no cells are present in
this
and i mean few unmyelinated fibers so
that is plexus of
course very very close to this and
please do make your own presence or
absence of the cell free zone depends
upon the functional status of the pulp
it may be it may not it may not be
appear in the case of very end pulp and
it may not be appear in the case of very
old bulb
salary john which is filled with lots of
cells that is
your fibroblasts are the most common
cells followed by the undifferentiated
mesenchymal cells which can be
differentiated into
any type basing upon the stimulus that
is given by the pulp okay
so these are the first predominant cells
and followed by undifferentiated amazing
coming so the second predominant cells
coming to the fibers fibers you can see
elastic fibers
surrounded by the vessels and the main
function of electric fibers is to
is to keep pressure so that the blood is
going to move circulate and the next one
is the collagen fibers which forms the
body of the pulp
the type of collagen fibers that
represent in the pulp are type 1 and
type 3 type 1 is predominant when
compared to the type 3 and the ratio of
55 is to 45
so i mean regularly enamel doesn't have
no collagen in an enamel
type one collagen is present in the
painting
type ones collagen and type three
collagens are present in the case of
pdl in every part you have
mostly type 1 that is the predominant
so uh of course of course this is a
question that is given in the
examination
okay in an endo endo point of view in
the last year
that is during the pulpotomy procedures
the bad brows should be engaged
uh in the epical reason because apical
one third has
more your apical one third has more
collagen
so compared to the coronal one-third the
apical one-third matrix contains more
collagen which is fibrous and whitish
so you have to keep your brows at the
apical one-third and turn it
turn it so that the so that the
barbs which are present on the browse
are going to lock the collagen
collagen fibers and the pulp can be
removed in one shot
so these are the blood pressure values
see the pulp where does the pulp stands
they can give a sequence based question
on this
and the basically the pulpal pressure
influenced by the vascular tone in the
neighbor
neighboring tissues because how the
neighboring tissues are going to react
is how the
dynamics of pulp dynamics of blood blood
blood variations in the parliament this
this is the theory which is going to
explain that
don't go very deep into the theory but
do make a note
what is the stealing theory says that
stealing theory says the pulp
pulpal flow pulpal blood flow is
influenced by the vascular tone of the
surrounding periodontium or surrounding
structures in it
and do make a note this makes the pulp
more available to the clinical
situations when a simple application of
matrix band
lead to ginger information but could
affect the pulpal tissue also but how
the pulp is going to save itself is this
theory is going to explain
and coming to the innovation we have
already discussed about this here you
have more
unmyelinated c fibers which are present
at the center you can see c fibers at
the center that is core fibers
and you can see all the a fibers which
are present in the periphery
periphery is a fibers and central core
is the c fibers and 75 percentages are
the c fibers
which are unmyelinated slow fibers
whereas 25 percenters are myelinated
your a delta fibers okay so in the ta
fibers the major content of a fibers is
going to be a delta that is 90 percent
is a delta and very few cases you can
see
a beta fibers coming to the
pulpal calcifications all the pulpal
stones which are common occurrence and
it is basically
is related these types of pulpal
calcifications pulpal stones which comes
under the
dystrophic calcification so please do
make a note in a general path your
calcifications are important
that is your dystrophic calcifications
and metastatic calcifications what is
the difference between them what is the
examples
everything were covered in the mock
exams if you are not clear just go back
and see this is a very very important
area
so basing upon the structure it can be
true pulse stone or a false pulp stone
and basing up on the size it may be fine
or diffuse and basing up on the location
it can be free
attached or it can be embedded okay
so please do add a note of this
line so they can ask you diagram based
question so please do watch
try to understand histological diagram
based questions are common so i don't
want you to miss any
any any of these and hcrs that is hotfix
epithelial root sheet and root formation
you hope you are very familiar with this
and it contains of
inner and outer animal epithelium only
you can see this inner and
outer enamel epithelium this in the
outer part and inner part
and spongy bone so
spongy bone fills the areas between the
cortical plates and the alveolar bone
proper
and i mean i mean most of this bone
marrow
have particular types of cells like
pluripotent cells
which can be differentiated into any
type of cells the cancellous component
in the
mandible is more than in the than in the
sorry maxilla is more than in the
mandible and if you take the types of
i mean radiogram radiographic
examinations the analysis is
divided into two types that is a type
one and type two type one
uh type on a regular and horizontal
ladder like
arrangement and type two are irregular
so please do
go through with go through this content
this content is important
lactoferrin being questions are being
asked in the lactoferrin already we have
learned about the saliva
and the components the components of
saliva
so it's a lactoferrin is a bactericidal
it has a bacterial cell effect due to
its strong
iron binding capacity it removes the
iron from the solution and makes it
unavailable as an essential bacterial
neutron so that is the main reason how
the lactoferrin is going to
work on coming to the stages of tooth
development that is i hope you are very
familiar with the stages too
please do go back we have given uh two
or three questions
in in various mock examinations
explaining all the content related to
the histological diagram based content
related to your
bell stays cap stays early early well
stays
advanced bell stays cups and everything
so please go with this histological
diagrams
because 2020 they have asked and their
high chances to repeat those
examinations
and what are the morphological changes
and how their physiologically related
initiation takes place in the
dental lamella whereas proliferation
where does it takes place is
history differentiation more for
differentiation what are the
consequences of history differentiation
it means you will have the histological
defects like i'm allergens is
imperfected antennas insane perfect
all this comes under histological
different defect in histological
differentiation morphological
differentiation is change in shape
your dilaceration everything like they
comes in the change in shape
and the number of teeth comes problems
comes in the initiation so
so please do make a note of all these
things uh dental lamella
okay the activity that total activity of
dental amble extends
over a period of at least five years
so please do make a note of the rest of
racist
sex determination for the teeth okay the
mainly by you have something called as
an
um a melody amalgam we have already
learned a melodogen is a non-emulation
seeing that emergency is a major
uh matrix protein that is secreted by
the amyloblast which has
different codings in male and female for
example they called xy
in female they have two similar similar
ones two identical
american and genes whereas in the male
they have two different atoms so this
gene helps in identifying the sex
determination in the
human beings just by taking the teeth
you can identify whether it is a male
patient or a female patient
so microwave processing these are some
advanced
histological things which are frequently
asked nowadays in the examination
so microwave micro micro oven
microwave oven processing has been
successful
and easily accepted in many laboratories
and
microwave works on the principle of
causing
uh molecules to rotate rapidly and
collide and results in internal heat
production simultaneously
okay thus i mean if you compare this
this is a very very important thing
so it requires much lesser time than the
conventional methods and the tissue can
be sectioned and strained
within four to six hours so it's a
primary advantage so just go with the
underlying stuff
and these are these are the few areas
where you need to make a note
make a note of this underlying stuff
okay of course this is the most familiar
question
ten percent is a formula is the most
commonly used uh
fixant okay and uh the other important
things that you have to make you know
extracted teeth are stored in okay
regular question most of you get
confused with hydrogen peroxide but
extracted it should be stored
and preserved in ten percent test
formula and until they are
used okay so xylen free tissue
processing and straining just go with
this
just go with this this is the question
once given okay the uses of jalen d
it takes place in two minutes and what
are the steps in this okay what are the
steps in this and everything are very
very important so please do go with this
we have all we have discussed everything
in detail on the groups okay just go
with this because you can
it's going to take one or two minutes
not more than that but they can ask
because they if they want to throw a new
question
in dental hist this is the area of
choice to throw new questions because
most of
our unaware and if you open your basic
m6 books that doesn't touch this
area
yeah i'm done for now signing off dr
srikanth from team
mds conquer all the best stay positive
uh make a note
spend one hour one one half hour time
with dental histology
uh like like you can you can like this
this video is going to be half an hour
you can spend another one one half hour
so two hours
two hours is very sufficient time for
dentalist and make sure you try to cover
the synopsis part of your pv books
as well as i mean like hardly like 10 to
15 pages and followed by the synopsis of
your dental pulse and yeah that's all
all the best bye take it
