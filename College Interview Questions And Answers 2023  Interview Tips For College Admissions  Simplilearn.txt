interview please leave your answer in
the comment section all right so College
interviews are a part of holistic
Admissions and are typically conducted
in combination with the written test and
group discussions they are typically the
final stage of a selection process and
are heavily weighted in the selection
metrics these interviews helps the
college determine whether you're
consciously pursuing the course or if
there is an element of confusions or a
personality floww all right so moving
ahead let's understand why College
interviews are
important so College interviews will
give you a glimpse into what will be
expected of you throughout the course of
you have applied they are as much for
the college to understand your
appropriateness as it's for you to
understand the vision and expect
expectations of the college at a more
personal
level not only that but sometimes you
are with other aspirants like yourself
during the waiting period for hours
before their interview in that case the
college interview can be a starting
point for the network in Fr Circle you
will be a part of during college and
perhaps even after that so let's go
ahead and have a look at some college
interview questions one by
one the first question is tell us about
yourself so this this is a classic first
question but still the most confusing a
good trick to remember present past and
future so you can start by speaking a
few lines about your content role course
and how that broadens your scope for
what you are applying for then you can
say a few lines from your experiences in
the past that are directly linked with
what you have applied
for after that connect this with your
future aspirations and how the course
you're going for will help you reach
them
here the key is to keep College course
you have applied for at the center of
your
answer expressing your answer like this
will cut through the noise and allow the
interview panel to focus on you that is
the most useful to them as the
interviews are more interested in your
vision ambition and
aspirations to understand it in a better
way take an example you're applying to a
business school while pursuing a job at
a tech company so in this case you would
tell the interviewer about your current
role and what characteristics in your
personality LED you to the conclusion
that an MBA would help you in that
role moving forward the next question we
have is why this college SL
major so the easiest way to go about
this question is to speak the truth you
should give an honest answer to this
question but make sure to present your
answers well hopefully you would have
done some research before choosing the
college for which you're applying for
the interview describe the conclusions
of that research for your interview to
see speak about what you discovered
about the Excellency and public image of
the course and the range of
opportunities like high salary packages
better job opportunities and career
growth that it provides while putting in
some reasons specific to you as a person
and fit in most accurately in your
vision for your own life moving on to
the next question which is where do you
see yourself in the next 10 years
first and foremost such type of
questions are asked by the interviewers
to test your ability to deal with tri
questions and not a genuine interest in
your life story so while answering this
question make sure to let your
imagination
fly no one will come to check if you
have fulfilled each of the aspirations
you listed but giving imaginative
responses tells the board that you are
open-minded optimistic and creative
which are of course attractive traits to
have when you are as young as a college
aspirant usually
are next question on our list is what
are some areas of development that you
need to work upon areas of development
are the newest socially correct term for
weakness and reasonably so since no
weakness is permanent enough to be
called out in an interview there are two
pieces of advice to remember here
firstly use your words wisely so if you
feel your inability to manage your sleep
schedule in a noteworthy area of
development then don't say I sleep a lot
or I make it late to the appointments
because I was binge watching friends the
night before instead say that you have
trouble sticking to the important
selfcare routines for Effective working
hours when you say this it shows how
focused you are on your
self-development the second piece of
advice is to contextualize your area of
development which typically includes
describing an episode that made you
realize that what you mention is indeed
a significant area of development and
another where you made the progress in
that area of development by doing so the
interviewer will understand that you
have the complete knowledge of your area
of development and you are working on it
now coming to the fifth question so
which was the last book you
read so while answering this question
keep in mind that the books you read
reveal a lot about your mind and
thoughts that you have outside of the
workplace so if books are not your 4te
feel free to divert the interview's
attention to the last documentary or the
last YouTube lecture series you have
watched here the goal is to stick to
this topic so if you're applying for a
science course you wouldn't get
excellent points if that book if the
last book you read is Twilight Saga you
have to show the interviewer that you
think about the things that are
concerned of the college or or the
course outside the closed walls of the
interview to and explain how the last
book you read broaden your understanding
of
that all right now moving on to the next
question which is if you had to describe
your rule within your family/ friend
Circle how would you describe it
consider this answer to be a prototype
for all personality related questions so
while answering this question start with
a precise answer for example you can say
something like this I bring grounds to
my friend group and substantiate it with
real life experiences with you displayed
that specific quality as stated do this
for all the such questions like the key
is providing actual real life episodes
continuously to base your understanding
of yourself in reality and not delusions
that you emed from the media all right
now coming to the seventh question so
how are you planning on spending your
summer questions like this assist the
interview in determining the extent of
your personality beond the competition
of college interviews and admissions of
course do include the possible
internships or professional commitments
that you are looking to engage in but
also mention other hobbies that you will
be giving your time to while answering
this question consider personalizing
your answer by noting that taking
consistent vacations means a lot to you
and your family and it is one commitment
you are devoted to so our next question
is now if you had to change one thing
about your experience in high school
what would it be so these type of
questions involving high school
experiences may be the most offsetting
for some people because most of us
haven't processed our high school
experiences sufficiently to use them to
answer College interview questions in
such a short period of time now let's
have a quick look at some things that we
should keep in mind during our College
interview so first is to be confident
and truthful Beyond any advice on the
Internet only you can think about what
is worth marketing to the outside world
in you as a person second is
substantiate your responsive with facts
speaking generally about your
personality and character is too
self-obsessed and delusional avoid
giving your answers in a very abstract
terms always provide concrete evidence
from your experience verifying your
opinion of yourself third is make
friends try to interact with people who
have given the interview before you
either through the internet or or the
interview venue by doing this you will
get an idea of the
interview also if possible do some
research on who the interview board
members are last is to keep your subject
knowledge intact Excellence can be
substituted a solid understanding of
academic Concepts that will serve as the
foundation for the course you're
applying for will compensate for any
minor flaws in your ability to present
yourself as a person it boosts your
confidence which automatically
translates to a better response to a
non-academic questions hence keep the
knowledge of the subject that you're
applying
