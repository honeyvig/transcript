opt for the post graduation program in
business analysis from civilian which
has helped me a lot my professional and
personal life I have been teaching
having before I moved to the United
States years ago
I try to use Excel while teaching
research classes
but
since I only had the basic knowledge
about it and other business intelligence
tools it was very difficult for me at
the beginning but after completing this
class and learning how to use tools like
Excel Tableau power bi power query
problem I feel like it has been a total
game changer for me now I apply these
skills everywhere

yearly review I submitted all my
certificates to my university and based
on that my University plans to develop a
class focus on business analysis and
