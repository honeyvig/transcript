hello everyone and welcome to this
interesting video on ipl data analysis
by simply loan
indian premier league that is ipl is one
of the most popular and exciting events
in world cricket
ipl 2022 will begin on 26th of march so
it's the best time for us and our
viewers to learn about how to perform
exploratory data analysis using the
recently held ipl auction data set
so in this video all the results and
insights that you will see are totally
based on the data we have collected from
kegel we will leave a link to the data
set in the description of the video you
can go ahead and download it for this
demo we'll be using python and jupyter
notebook to answer special questions
so let's get started we'll move over to
our jupyter notebook
okay so i am on my jupyter notebook and
this is the file that we are going to
use so here you can see i have
some of the cells already filled in
so this will save us some time and we
can
explore this data set in depth so this
is the file that i'll be using or the
ipython notebook
cool
so first let's go ahead and import all
the crucial libraries that will be
needed for our analysis so here you can
see i'm importing the pandas library the
numpy library these are for data
manipulation and numerical computation
then we have cbon and matplotlib for
data visualization
then
i have imported this warnings
module
so that we do not get any warnings while
running the
code cool
so let me just hit shift enter to run
the first cell
so here we will import
all the libraries okay it's done
now the next step is i'm going to create
a data frame in the name of ipl
and here i'm importing the data set
using the read underscore csb function
which is part of the pandas library so
pd here has been imported as pandas i am
giving the
data set location followed by the name
of the data set so here the name is ipl
underscore 2022 underscore dataset dot
csv is the extension of the file
so let me go ahead and run this as well
all right so now we have
successfully imported or loaded our data
set
now the next step let's go ahead and
explore our
data set so i'll use the head function
for this
ipl dot head
okay so here you can see the different
columns we have
an unnamed column which is actually
unnecessary for our analysis so we'll
see how to drop this column apart from
that we have the name of the players the
base price at which the
player was sold or whether the player
was a draft pick so here rashid khan
from afghanistan hardik pandya then we
have subman gill these are all
draft pick and then we have the
price at which
the players were listed in the ipl
auction then we have the type of player
whether the player is a bowler an
all-rounder a batsman
or
a wicketkeeper
then we have the cost in rupees this is
in crores so basically this column tells
us the
price at which the player was sold in
the auction
then we have the price of the cost in
dollars
after that we have
2021 squad basically
this means
in last year's ipl where was the player
so here you can see rasith khan was
playing
for srh the sunrises hyderabad in 2021
but this year in 2022 he'll be playing
for gujarat titans similarly hardik
pandya was playing for mumbai indians
for past few seasons including 2021 but
this season is going to play for gujarat
titans
so on and so forth
now
let's see the total number of players
that are present in the data set and the
total columns that are there for this
i'm going to use
the shape attribute so i'll write ipl
dot shape you can see here there are
total 633 players that were part of the
auction and this includes the players
who were draft pick also
and there are total
eight columns in my data frame ipl
next
let's use the info function to check the
columns the data types and the total
non-null objects so i'll say
ipl dot info which is a function so i
have to use
brackets
there you go so here you can see it
saves total 633 entries from 0 to 632
data columns we have total 8 columns and
then these are the
different
column names and
here you can see the total normal
objects
present in the column
and here you can see the data types
and at the bottom you can see the
memory usage as well
cool
now
the dot columns attribute will return
the name of the columns in the
data set so if i say ipl dot columns and
run it it will give me
all the different column names that are
present in the data frame
now as i said
the first column which is unnamed
colon 0 is
actually unnecessary so we are going to
drop it for that
we are going to use the
dot drop function and then i have passed
in my
column name followed by the axis on
which access is it there
and then i say in place equal to true
which means it will
replace
and permanently remove
they are named column from the data
frame so let's run it and now we'll
again check
the head of the data frame you can see
before we had the
unnamed column which was the first
column in the data frame and now we have
successfully removed it so player
becomes the first column in the data
frame
all right
now moving ahead
let's see the total number of null
values that are present in each column
of the data set so i'll say
ipl dot i'm going to use the is null
function
followed by this sum function
if i run this you can see here
the player column doesn't have any null
values similarly base price and type
column also don't have any null values
but you can see cost and rupees and
cost in dollars have
nearly 396
missing or null values the reason being
those players were not
picked in the
ipl auction and hence there was no price
associated
and then you can see there were a few
players who were not part of the ipl
squad in 2021
so
those are being reflected as null as
well
now we'll check the
rows that have
cost in dollar as null or nan so here i
have
used ipl and after that i am passing in
the column name which is cost in dollars
and then i have used the is null
function
if i run this
you can
notice the
cost in
dollars column all these values are any
n or
null
and even the same
rows have
any n for cost in rupees as well
cool
now the
next task is to
fill these
null values or nan values with
zeros so for that i'm going to use the
fill any function and here i have passed
in 0 so all the null values in the data
set will be replaced with 0
for
cost in
rupees column and
cost in dollars column
let me just run it
all right
okay
now
we will see the players who were unsold
in the 2021 auction which means
we will check the rows that have null
values for the 2021 squad column
so what i'll do is i'll say
ipl
within
square brackets i'll say ipl and then
i'll pass in my
column name which is 2021
squad
and then after this i'll say dot
is null
so
this
cell
will give us
the unsold players in the 2021 auction
if i run this
you see here
you mark the 2021 squad column all these
players were unsold or did not
participate so hence it has nan values
all right
now what we are going to do is
we will replace all the null values
that are present in the
2021 score column with
not participated
like how we did in the previous example
we replaced all the null values with 0
here we'll replace with
a text value called not participated so
i'll say ipl
i'll pass in my column name which is
2021 squad
equal to
i'll say
ipl
2021
squad
dot
fill
any
which is the function and here i'll pass
in a
text or a string saying not
participated
all right
let's run it
before that let me just scroll it down
now i'll run it cool
now that we have treated the null value
successfully let's verify it again so
i'll just say ipl
dot
is null
and then i'm going to use this sum
function
if i run this
okay this is also a function cool now if
you see we have successfully removed all
the null values and replaced with either
zeros or not participated and hence now
you can see none of the columns in the
ipl data frame have null values so it
shows 0.
great
now moving ahead
now we are going to add another column
called
status
which will hold two values sold and
unsold
but before that
we are going to
slice
our data frame so here i am looking for
all the rows where
cost and rupees
is greater than
zero
and those should be unique and
i am storing the value in a variable
called teams so here you can see we have
the different teams where the
cost in rupees is greater than zero
now
i'm going to create
another
column called status so i have written
ipl
within square brackets i am passing in
the column name which is status and
that will be equal to
the team
replaced by
sold value let me just run it and show
you the result there you go
so here you can see we have added a new
column called status and it has values
sold
and unsold
if i just say ipl
at the bottom you can see
the unsold values as well
cool
now in the next cell
we are going to check for duplicated
players
so there are duplicate rows in the data
frame but here the names of the players
are same but in reality the players are
different
so
it is quite understood that
different players can have the same name
so
to get those names i am using the
duplicated function and i'll say keep
equal to false which means i don't want
to keep those players
now let's run it
there you go so here you can see
lalitha we have
two entries so lalithyadev here is an
all-rounder whose base price was 20 lakh
for 2022 ipl
and
last year
he was playing for the delhi capitals
and this year also
he is
sold
to delhi capitals
next we have
lalitha
who happens to be a bowler so this is
again different lalitha
so last year
he was unsold and even this year he
remains unsold
similarly we have amit mishra
who earlier used to play with the delhi
capitals but this time he remains unsold
so on and so forth so you can see two
entries for
shrink as well and shivam mishra
all right
now
let's answer a very basic question
we are going to find out how many
players
participated
in the 2022 ipl auction
for that we have already seen
the total number of rows that were
present but again i am going to use the
shape function and within
square brackets i'm going to say 0 which
means it will give me the total number
of rows
and you can see 633 players were part of
the auction this is as per our data that
we have collected from kegel
up next
we are going to find
how many types of players have
participated
so i'm going to say
types equal to
say ipl
i'll use the column name which is type
and i'm going to find the
count of
each type of players that are present in
the data frame
i'm going to use the values underscore
counts function
and then i'll say type
dot
reset underscore index
if i run it
okay there is an error here let me debug
the error
okay so this should be value underscore
counts and
the variable name is types are not type
so let's run it
you can see here
we have the different
types of players so all rounders there
are total 242 all rounders are part of
the auction then we have 215 bowlers 112
batsmen's and 64 wicket keepers
now using the above
table that we just created
i'm going to
plot my first
pie chart
so for that i'm going to use the
matplotlib pi function so plt.pi
i'm using
dot values since i want
only the values from this table
and then
i'm saying labels equal to types dot
index
i've used a label distance of 1.2 to
maintain some space
and then this is my format in which i
want to
print or show or display the percentage
of
distribution i am going to use shadow so
it says shadow equal to true which is
another parameter or an argument and
then i am going to start my angle at 60
degrees
and here i have used a title called rule
of players participated
that will have a font size of 15 and
finally i'm saying plt dot plot
so let me just run it
there you go so here we have a nice
pie chart or a pie plot so you can see
the different pies here
we have all rounder wicketkeeper
batter and bowler
so majorly
there are all rounders in the auction
followed by bowlers then we have 17.69
percent batters and 10.11 wicketkeepers
which is the lowest
cool
now
we are going to create another bar plot
or a bar graph that will tell us how
many players were sold and unsold
so for this i am going to use a count
plot so we will create two bars one for
sold and the other one for unsold and
each of the bars will have different
colors
one will have orange the other one will
have pink and i'm using labels so to
label the x-axis and y-axis i have sold
or unsold by label will have number of
players the title of my bar graph would
be sold versus unsold i am given a font
size of 15 and i am saying
plt dot plot now the function that you
see here at the bottom
will display the data labels for each of
the bars
let me just run it and show you the
result there you go
so i have used a figure size of 10 comma
5
all right now you can see we have a
really good
bar plot which says there were total 237
players sold and 396 players were unsold
as per the data we have
cool
now
you can also
print
the total sold and unsold values let me
show you how to do it
i'll say ipl
dot we can use the group by function
and i want to group it by
status column
and
the value that i want to measure is
the player's
count
so i'll say players
rather player and then i'm going to use
the
count function if i run this you can see
here
i've successfully grouped the unsold and
sold players the values are matching
with
the bar plot that we just created so
sold where 237 players are unsold are
396.
cool
now
we are going to see the total number of
players bought by each team again this
is going to be a count plot so basically
a bar plot
so here the condition i'm passing is
in the teams column the value shouldn't
be unsold
so
players bought means the value should be
sold so here i'm using this condition
and the rest of the things remains the
same
one improvement i have done here is i'm
using x takes
rotation equal to 70 degrees this
basically means the x labels would be
tilted by 70 degrees
now let's see
the bar plot there you go so here you
can see i have the title players bought
by each team on the y-axis we have the
number of players
and on the x-axis you can see the values
have been tilted by
70 degrees let me just zoom in so that
you can see better
and this is the bar plot
so the maximum a team can purchase is 25
players some of the teams have also
purchased 24 22 and 23 players let me
just
show you so
gujarat titans have totally purchased 22
players
then
delhi capitals have total 24 players in
their squad
again
lucknow supergiants have 22 players
if i scroll and see again bangalore
loyal challengers or rcb the royal
challenges bangalore have
22 players in the team
and rajasthan royals and sunrises
hyderabad have
24 and 23 players respectively in their
teams
all right
now
we will create three more columns
called
retention
base price
and base price unit for that
first of all i am creating a new column
called retention which is equal to
ipl base price let me just run it
and then
i am going to replace
these values that are present in the
list 2 crore 40 lakh 20 lakh 1 crore 30
lakh 1.5 crore
with
from auction
and i'm saying in place equal to true
let me just run it
then we are going to
treat the base price
so here
in the base price
column i'm going to replace
draft pick value as 0 so let's run that
as well
and now
i'm going to split
the base price
value into two separate values called
bree spice unit and base price so
basically i'm splitting
on the space
that i have let me show you how it is
going to split
so this is let's see our
base price column
what i did was i
replaced the draft pick values to zero
and then the rest of the values will be
split into two columns called base price
unit so basically it will have the
unit
of the base price let's say crores or
lakhs
and the base underscore price column
will have the value which is 2 here 40
20 20 so on and so forth
let me just scroll down
and
run that particular cell
now to create
these two columns the base price unit
column and the base underscore price
column i have used the lambda function
and i'm splitting based on the space
let's just run it
now i have replaced
retained with zero
and
let me show you the
final data frame that i have
so here you can see we have replaced
the draft pick values in the base price
column to zero
and on the right side you can see the
three different columns that i wanted to
create
so one is called retention
so zeros refer to draft pick
any other value will say
the player was picked from the auction
then you have the base price
unit so here
you can see crores
lacks
and the value base price is 2
40 so on and so forth

description to know more
now
let's check how many players were
retained and bought from the auction
by each of the teams
so i'll say
ipl let me just scroll down
dot
i'm going to use the
group by function
then i'll
say team
comma
retention
and i am going to
use the value
as
retention because i want to find the
count of
retained players
then i'll say
colon
minus 1.
let me run it
you can see here
the different team names because i have
grouped by team and then retention so i
have changed super kings
from the auction they had picked
21 players and they had retained
four players coming to delhi capitals
delhi capitals in the 2022
ipl auction they picked total 20 players
and they have retained four similarly if
i scroll down let me talk about let's
say punjab kings they have
pegged 23 players from the auction and
retained two players from
the team last year
talking about
rcb or all challenges bangalore they
have picked 19 players from the auction
and they have retained
three players
all right
now in the next cell of code
we are going to display the players in
each team
based on the different types of players
so let me just run it and show you the
result
so here i am using the same condition
the value shouldn't be equal to
unsold
and i am going to use another parameter
called hue for the different colors so
here i have used hue
as type because i want to
show the players in each team based on
the different
types
again i have given my
title to the bar plot
and then i have the x label the wire
label and my rotation is 50 degrees now
if i scroll down you can see the
different
types of players here is the legend so
blue is for blue
orange or yellow
it's for all rounder green is for batter
and red
which also looks like maroon is for
wicket keepers
and on the
x-axis you can see the different team
names
all right
now let's answer another
couple of questions so here i have
what is the highest amount spent on a
single player by each team
so to solve this question i'll say
my data frame name that is ipl
then i'm going to
say retention
equal to equal to
this should be from
auction because
you want to see the highest amount spent
and not
from the retained players
then i'm going to
group
by
i'll say
team
and then
i'll say
cost
in
let me just copy it from here
cost in rupees that is in crores
and
i'll say
max
colon
-1
dot
sort underscore
values
i'll say ascending
equal to false which means i want the
sorted
result in descending order
okay
let me just
bring this to the left side and we'll
run it
there seems to be some error let me
check the error it sees
there's a spelling mistake this should
be
team
let me run it again there you go
so you can see
mumbai indians
have spent
15.25 crores
for one of the players and
this player happens to be sean kissin
then
chennai super kings have spent the
highest amount for
a player who happens to be a bowler the
name is deepak chahar they have bought
him for 14 crores kolkata knight riders
bought
shreyas a year for 12.25 crores
and so on and so forth
so these are the highest amounts spent
on a single player by each of the teams
let me scroll down
now we are going to see the player
retained at
maximum value or maximum price
now if you follow ipl the maximum
price
at which a player was retained happens
to be ravindra jadeja so let's see at
what price was he retained
i'll say
retention
equal to equal to
i'll say
retained
then i'll say
sort underscore
values
by equal to
i'll use the
same column
cost in
rupees
that's in crores
i'll say
ascending equal to
false
dot
head
and i want to find the top player
again there's some error
let's see
where is the error
she's ascending equal to false
dot head
okay this should be
sort underscore
values
within bracket i should say
buy
i think this should be
fine now let's run it
there you go
so you can see here our result is player
name ravindra jadeja who was retained
for 16 crores by chennai super kings
cool
now the next cell of code will
display or print the top five bowlers
who have been picked
in this year's ipl based on
their cost in inr
let me just run it and show you the
result
you can see here deepak chahar went for
14 crores then we have shraddha thakur
who was bought by
delhi capitals earlier he was part of
csk
for
10.75 crores then we have prasada
krishna who has been bought by rajasthan
royals this time
last year he was with keker and he has
been bought for 10 crores similarly loki
ferguson has been bought by gujarat
titans and he played for kkr last season
he has been bought for 10 crores while
his base price was too crows then we
have avish khan
you can see avishkhan's base price was
just 20 lakhs and he has been bought for
10 crores by lucknow super giants again
and last year he was part of the daily
capitals
now you can replace
this value
suppose let's say you want to find the
top five batsman's picked or batters
picked with the highest amount you can
just see
batter instead of bowler and if i run
this
you can see here
syria sayer was bought by
kolkata nitriders for 12.25 crores last
year he was part of delhi capitals
then you have
shimran haitmaia who's from
west indies he has been
picked by the rajasthan royals for
five crores then we have rahul tribati
sikha dhaban and devda particle
now if you wanted to check for
let's say all rounders
you can replace batter with all rounder
if i run this
you can see
lamb living stone has been bought by
punjab kings this season
for
11.5 crores his beast price was just one
crore and last year he was part of the
rajasthan royals
then we have a player from sri lanka
asaranga then we have hershel patel
shahrukh khan and rahul devatia who have
been
the top five all-rounders picked at
highest amount
cool
now finally
we want to
see the players who were part of the ipl
last season but were not picked for this
year's ipl
so for that what i am doing is first i
am renaming my
2021 squad column
this column i want to
rename it as previous team
let's run it
then
i am going to find out the unsold
players so here i am saying previous
team not equal to
not participated
and then
i am using another condition the team
should be equal to equal to unsold and
i'm going to find out only the player
and the previous team
so let's run it and see the result
so here you can see
these players were part of the ipl last
season but
they haven't been picked this season and
last season they had played for let's
say surah shriner played for csk steve
smith was part of the delhi capitals
sakibal hassan
was part of kkr if i scroll down you
have david milan who played for punjab
kings in 2021
in morgan
who played for kkr he also captained kkr
but unfortunately he was
not picked this season chris lane from
australia also
remained unsold this season
and to tie we have been cutting aditya
there are other players as well
we have kane richardson dhawal kulkarni
cool so these were the players who are
part of the ipl season 2021 but
unfortunately were not picked and
remained unsold for 2022 season
cool
and that brings us to our
end of this demo session on
ipl data analysis 2022 so we learned
how to
use the different functions
and attributes that are part of
the
python libraries and we manipulated the
data we visualized the data and
answered some specific questions
so that brings us to the end of our
video tutorial on ipl data analysis for
2022 i hope it was useful and
informative if you have any queries
please feel free to put them in the
comments section of the video thanks
again stay safe and keep learning
