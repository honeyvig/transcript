the pinned comment and description box
below to find a data analytics program
that fits your experience and areas of
Interest now without further delay let's
quickly hop on to Microsoft Excel
workbook so here I have already created
a sample pay slip generator so here we
have use some data validation methods to
select the employee details let's say I
want to go with Brian and here we have
his employee ID his full name and the
month March right and apart from that
the number of hours worked you know and
here the total number of hours he logged
in was this and number of times his
client call got cancelled or he was on a
sick leave casual leave in the month of
March and total rate for each and every
event so if he logined he'll get about
$45 and in case if he's on a leave due
to a client call cancel he'll get $20
for SI leave $30 casually $25 and public
holiday is $30 and end of the day we can
just you know multiply these two values
to get his final salary right so if we
drag this sross overall here so we'll
get a salary for March right so this is
real time so you just select the
employee name and here you just select
the month which is about present in this
particular sheet here and you will get
all the details right and here is the
time sheet for the month of March and
all the employees will logged in and
what are the events happening right so
this seems interesting but how did we
create it and how come we have all the
employees here without any duplications
when you can see there is a complete
duplicate entries or two times entries
over here right how did we filter this
out and how did we export this data into
a baselp generator and how is it looking
up at all those values and how is it
summing up the salary right so we have
multiple uh uh formulas and functions
implemented in this particular P lip
generator so without further delay let's
try to recreate this particular pay list
or P lip generator so firstly we will
create a sorted and filtered list let's
quickly rename this as sorted and
filtered employee
list so what we're going to do is
firstly we will try to import entire
list of all the employees present in
this particular organization by using
the unique function you guessed that
right so we are just fetching the unique
values one time only for once into this
particular list and we will also if
possible it's not mandatory but here I
have sorted them in the alphabetical
order right so that it is a little bit
easier for you to track now let's try to
name this as
employee right and here I will use the
unique function un and I QE Just Tab to
select the function and the array is
here so we have converted this
particular you know table into an actual
table using the controlt function in
Excel and I'll select this particular
you can see that highlighted downside
Arrow right in the bold black color so
that means it is pointing to select the
entire column just click that line and
there you go your entire column has been
selected now this is one way of or one
part of extracting unique functions now
another one is to try to sort these
employees list in the alphabetical order
right so I'll be using the sort function
over here press tab to select now close
the bracket over here and press enter
now you have the entire list of
employees in the alphabetical order and
there is no chance for any duplication
in this particular list right so this is
part one you can just quickly save your
file so that you don't miss any track
right and uh the next one is the
activities so one they have logged in
second one they have logged in and by
some reason the client call or the
business meeting has been cancelled so
they're sitting idle or they don't have
anything to do maybe they're logging off
early right so that is the second
situation third one is an actual sick
leave fourth one is a planned casual
leave and the fifth one is a public
holiday so mostly many organization five
events now we will copy and paste these
uh activities or events into this
particular sheet over here which has
sorted and filtered list of employees
now now we are going to calculate the
month here so you can add month and here
you can deal with the same MCH data that
we have used here you can just copy and
paste that value over here as well so
you can also manually write it down as
March 2024 March April 2024 anything
correct now we're dealing with this
particular March data so we will proceed
with March data as well now the last one
this can be named as pay
slip
generator right so if we check the B
slip generator over here what we have
here is the first one employee name
right so you can first add that
particular employee select option over
here right select employee and here you
will name or you will try to add the
employee name so if you check this
particular sheet too I have the data
validation option enabled here I can
just select the employees from the drop
down so let's try to create a drop down
over here equals to or you can just go
to data option here just click the S and
go to the data option over here and here
you have columns click the drop- down
option and go to data validation now
here instead of any value go to list and
here you can give the list of employees
that you recently filtered this is one
way of doing it but what's the downside
of it let's say I add a new employee
over here okay let's cancel this
operation right away and let's say I add
a new employee right over here maybe as
Jonathan he's a new joiny he's an intern
or you know he is a new joiny something
like that so when I add Jonathan over
here the data validation from this
particular section would not be able to
identify him as a new joiny the list
will end at this place which is this one
right so we don't want that to be Happ
happening now we need to operate on a
different approach for creating this
particular data validation option so the
approach is really simple if you just
get into this particular sorted list
over here and if you check this list you
can see we have uh the First Column as
employ starting from snooper to all the
way to the last Jonathan right now what
we need to do is create a new formula so
just enter into the formula option right
away here and use the defined name
option so that you're defining a new
formula Al together and here you can
type it down as employee so you'll list
of
employees list of employees you can
write an underscore so that the formula
doesn't uh get confused so here we
have so where it is referring to right
so it is referring to this particular
column so a to a so just add an #over
here so that it will automatically
update if there is any new addition to
the list now here we'll create a data
validation go to data and data tools
data validation and instead of any value
go to list and here you will type the
source as equal to
employee there you go uh maybe we have
to do a light change over here okay now
go to sort so here we generated a
formula so okay let's try to review that
formula over here list okay
and so let's go to the employees list
select the first cell over here there
you go and Define a name so the name
will be
EMP list sorted and filtered employees
so here you will be adding a hash
so we have we have written the hash
after this now we want that to go along
with the entire spell from second cell
to the entire existence of that
particular list right in case if there
is a new edition you can enter that new
edition and consider that as an employee
right so youve done that just press okay
there you go now go to the pp generator
and here create a data validation option
let's clear this now go to data data
validation and here you will be
selecting a list and here you will be
writing
EMP list that you just created press
okay now you have the employees list and
in case if you add a new employe at the
end he will also he or she will also be
considered as an employee now part of
the job is done the next is a few more
details like uh the
employee number and employee
aim and let's check the yeah the month
correct so now how would you generate
the employee number so employee number
is like fetching when it comes to
fetching nothing is better than a lookup
function or an index match let's proceed
with a lookup function I'd go with v
lookup since it's my favorite one so
this B2 will be my lookup value and the
lookup uh table is this particular a
table go to a corner and give that this
is the table you are looking at uh you
want the second column which states to
the payroll ID or employee ID and I want
an exact match close the bracket and
there you go now select the employee
number or employee name here and you
will have the employee number right here
and here you want to add the employee
name which is this particular cell
whatever is present in that particular
cell is your employee name and here you
want to add the month which is this
particular month which we currently
correct so far so good now we want to
create the fa lip generator so first if
we take a look at this particular one
here we have the
activity and here we have the number of
hours and salary now let's copy the same
P it in our facelip generator right here
some formatting if you feel
like there you go we have a formatting
ready and here as well and here we will
add our hours and rate and
salary there you go and I think we
already predefined our rates so copy and
paste the rates right
here now we need to calculate the number
of hours logged in and for that we will
be using a simple sufs function equals
to sufs so you need to pay a little
attention to this particular sumus
function because everything relies on
how you are freezing the cell values so
you might be a little confused so you
can understand what I mean during the
execution of the sums function so sums
and now the sum range so the sum range
is nothing but the hours table right
over here just click on the hours comma
so after hours we will be selecting the
employee correct so to the person who is
working which is this particular column
just navigate your cursor to the
location where the cell B2 and B3 are
intersecting which is a black line over
there so you can see that particular
Mouse icon which is which looks like a
lower pointing downward Arrow key just
click that downward Arrow key and your
column will be selected and that's next
one now comes the critical part so you
need to go back to the pel generator
over here and select the employee name
so employee name is existing in cell B5
so select B5 try to freeze it function
F4 so that this value doesn't change
because we going to drag this formula
across the next four activities so when
you drag the formula the formula should
be pointing to B5 but not succeed to B6
B7 Etc right that's the major thing
which you need to make sure and after
that you need to find the activity right
so go back to the time sheet data and
here is the activity or status Point
your mouse pointer to that particular
location where G3 and G2 intersect so
that you get the downward Arrow key just
click that there you go comma Now comes
another major part B Li generator sheet
so now we are on the pp generator so we
need an if condition so so it needs to
identify if the activity is what's
present in cell D3 or D4 D5 d67 based on
the table what we have then print it the
way it is and if not just the way it
should be right so you will understand
that more clearly when we start with the
if condition just select the if
condition press tab to select and cell
location D3
if D3 is equals to the activity which is
logged in then it should be nothing just
blank if not then it should have lugged
in which is again
D3 now close the brackets so close the
functions there you go now press enter
there you have it number of hours now
just drag this formula across all the
rows and you have it so now you have a
real time fael generator just uh change
some employ to check if our formula is
working and it's working fine you can
also eliminate the leading zeros but but
let's keep it right every minute counts
now the final one the salary slip
generator so
E3 Cross or star into the rate enter now
you can drag the same formula across all
the celles to find the total salary now
you can also do a final customization
over here just copy and paste the cell
and drag this and uh you can
merge total
salary can even bold this here you can
have sum of all this enter the final
salary you can also do some formatting
so there you go that's how you can
create a realtime automated Basel
generator in Excel and with that we have
come to an end of this session on how to
