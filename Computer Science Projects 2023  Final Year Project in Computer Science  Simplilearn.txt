hello everyone it's anisha from simply
learn it's my pleasure to welcome you
all to this session today we are here to
discuss the project you can take up in
your final year graduation the only
thing that matters in your final
graduation is your project after
graduation you may work for a company or
you may continue your studies in any
field related to i.t
where your project has a significant
influence
if you are confused about which domain
to choose or which project to conduct
don't worry we are here to help you
before we begin please subscribe to our
simplyland youtube channel and hit the
bell icon to get more updates
the agenda for today's session is we are
going to see the top five domains that
you can select to connect a project
then we will look through a three
project from eastwood at last we have
some bonus project
let's begin the session by understanding
the domain and its importance in
connecting a project
in general a domain is a particular
field of thoughts activity or interest
especially one over which you have
control and know in and out
when it comes for a computer science it
indicates the domain of interest
you must select a domain which one you
are interested and know about
once you are done with selecting a
domain choosing the project is the
easiest job
the top five booming domains that you
can choose to conduct a project are
artificial intelligence web technology
data science machine learning and iot
let's explore one by one artificial
intelligence it stimulates the human
intelligence by machine especially a
computer system the model built in ai
exhibits all the characteristics of
humans such as learning problem solving
etc
ai has a sub fields like machine
learning and deep learning which will
help to build different models in ai
the project you can conduct in this
domain are android energy classification
new specification using nlp
and celebrity image classification
and redundancy classification using cnn
it is a model built using a cn algorithm
that is a convolutional neural network
algorithm cnn comes under deep learning
or subset of ai which will classify the
digits which are written in adds
cnn is a 7-layer model which will
extract the features from the input data
set and identify the digits
we use this cortex gradient decent and
the back propagation algorithm to train
and test the mns data set
the next is a nice classification using
nlp
news classification is a model built
using a natural language processor
the main objective of this project is to
build a model which will classify
whether the news is fake or true
nlp will classify the news based on the
meaning of that message
or the sentence
the same mechanism is applied for the
data set and we have done this project
using a python nlp algorithm and a
toolkit jupyter notebook
the next is a celebrity image
classification celebrity image
classifier is a machine learning and a
web application
here we will build a model with the user
and the server interactions
the user must upload as image of a
celebrity and the model will predict
whose image is that using a python
libraries
the next domain you can take up is a web
technology
it is a tool in the technique to
establish a communication between the
devices over internet
we use a web browser to access a web
page this web browser is a program that
displays text data picture and many more
on the internet
the web technology consists of tools
like html css php javascript etc and
which are used to design a web page
the project you can connect in this
domain are placement cell
cyber cafe management and milk dairy
management
placement cell placement cell is
application built for the colleges we
use html css php javascript for the
front end and mysql for the bracket
design it consists of two modules that
is the user and the admin
if there is a new user you must register
and upload all the details required
and then this application will include
all the upcoming and ongoing placements
in the college the next is a cyber cafe
management system
in this project we are designing a
computer system for the cyber cafe
this makes the management of recording
the user details internet usage building
easier
this application is built using a tool
like html css php javascript and mysql
with this application we can maintain a
database with all the details of the
customers
the next project is a milk diary
management
it is a web application to help all the
military we use html css javascript and
php to design this application
it consists of two modules that is the
admin and the customer
and it also includes the customer build
system
fifa is a new customer he must register
and apply for the stocks that he
required
the next domain you can take up is a
data science
this is an analytical technology which
will extract the information from the
data for decision making strategy
planning and many more
the most of the data science programming
are done using a python programming
language as python is easy to code open
source and user friendly etc python is
rich in libraries that will support all
the data science models
the project you can take up in this
domain are
whether data set analysis current asset
analysis and diabetes prediction
whether data set analysis
here we will analyze the weather
parameters like temperature pressure
humidity etc
this application is used to inform and
support the decision making
this application is built using the data
science analytical concepts the same
concepts are applied to whether it is
set and obtain the accuracy
the next is a car dataset analysis
this project will give an idea about the
car and its parameter and help the buyer
to buy an efficient car
we will apply the data science
techniques and the data set to remove
all the outliers
outliers of the data which are which are
consisting of missing values duplicate
values which are present in our data set
are removed using their data science
techniques and we will apply a random
forest and a linear regression to
classify our data into training and
testing data then we will find the
accuracy of our model
the next is a diabetes prediction
diabetic prediction is a medical field
application used to predict the
diabetics patients by their health
condition we will apply the xg boost and
the random forest algorithm to the data
set we will divide and classify the data
set into train and test data then we
will find the accuracy of our model
the next domain that you can take up is
a machine learning it is a field of
computers and artificial intelligence in
which data and the algorithm stimulates
the human learning this will gradually
increase the accuracy and the
automatically enables the computer to
learn from its historical data
machine learning is the critical part of
data science and one of the rapidly
increasing field nowadays
the project you can conduct in this
domain are wireless on control
restaurant reviews in nlp and
self-driving cars
wireless sound control this model is
built using a python library such as
opencv pychamp tensorflow etc
the main objective of this project is to
provide a contactless experience to the
user while controlling the system volume
using media pipe we have built a model
to control our system volume by our and
gesture
we can increase or decrease our system
sound moving our hand in front of our
camera
the next project you can take up is a
restaurant review using nlp
this is a project built using the
library search of python such as a numpy
pandas matpot leave etc
we will convert the review statement
into a rating for example food is good
is rated as 1 and the order his bad is
rated as 0. the same rating mechanism is
applied to the data set and will find
the accuracy of our model
the next project is in this domain are
self-driving car
self-driving are the upcoming modern
technology for the cars
the machine learning model is built in
this project to help the car navigate
this is done using the opencv and the
python libraries and also will specify
the model accuracy
the next domain you can take up is a iot
internet of things is a collective
network that is connected the device in
the technology
it will facilitate the communication
between the devices and the clouds and
between the devices themselves
the project you can conduct under this
domain are
smart forming using iot technologies
smart doorbell and social distancing
smart farming using other technologies
smart farming is a device built to
detect the soil temperature moisture
humidity
this device will help the farmer to know
the conditions of the soil we need
arduino nano ide temperature and
moisture sensor some jumper wires to
build this device this device will have
a direct contact with the soil and the
measurement is shown in the monitor
screen the next project is a smart door
pin
smart doorbell
in this digital world everything is
becoming smart
the smart doorbell is a device built
using a raspberry pi breadboard
resistors and some wires this device
will tell who is at your doorstep and
sends their picture to your specified
email id the device is fixed to door and
the connection is given to the doorbell
as soon as the doorbell is pressed the
device will send an email to the user
the next project is social distancing
social distancing is one of the puzzle
for the workers in covid19 the range of
ultrasonic sensors can measure the
distance between the workers with a
centimeter accuracy and alert those who
are too close this device is built using
the arduino uno ide and ultrasonic
sensors now it's time to know the some
bonus projects
you can also take up some of the other
projects like college connect chat up
food waste management system
student result management system traffic
sign recognization and art news
with this we have reached the end of
this session today we saw the top five
domains and the project you can conduct
in that domain
