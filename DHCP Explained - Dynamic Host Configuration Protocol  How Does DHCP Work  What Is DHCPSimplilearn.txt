imagine you just bought a new smartphone
and you're very much excited to
connected to your home Wi-Fi but guys as
soon as you enter the Wi-Fi password
your phone starts to connect with the
network but have you ever wondered how
your phone actually gets an IP address
to join that Network yes guys the answer
is DHCP protocol DHCP stands for dynamic
host configuration protocol so guys you
can think of DHCP as a network host who
welcomes every new device as soon as
your phone tries to connect DCP quickly
assigns it to an IP address like giving
it a unique seat at the table so guys in
today's video we are going to study
about the DHCP protocol which is one of
the most important Concepts in the
networking craving a career upgrade
subscribe like and comment
below dive into the link in the
description to FasTrack your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher
simply learn has your
back but before we move on just a quick
info guys simply learn has got a
post-graduate program in cyber security
this course in cyber security is
designed to equip you with the skills
required to become and cyber security
expert the aim of this program is to
help you stay AB breast of all the
latest Trend in cyber security so guys
hurry up now and join the course the
course link is mentioned in the
description box so guys let's get
started so guys let us start with what
is ghcp DHCP stands for dynamic host
configuration protocol it is a system
that helps devices like computers
laptops and smartphones to connect to a
network automatically by giving them
necessary settings such as IP addresses
you can think of DCP as a helper that
makes sure each device on a network gets
its own address so it can communicate
with other devices without any mixups so
guys for example we have in a company
with many employees using desktops and
laptops
DHCP automatically assigns each device a
unique IP address like
192.168.1.2 where they connect to the
network it also provides other important
details like subnet mask which helps the
device understand which part of the IP
address this network and what part is a
device then there is a routers address
which is a gateway to other networks
usually something like
192.168.1.1 and the DNS address which
helps a device to find websites like
using 8.8.8.8
that connects to the network and
requests an IP address from the DHCP
server then you get DCP relay it
basically acts as a middleman passing
messages between clients and the server
especially useful when they are on the
different networks then you have the IP
address pool where a collection of IP
addresses that the DHCP server can
allocate to their devices on the network
then you have subnets which are smaller
segments of a larger networks helps to
organize and manage Network traffic
efficiently then the sixth one is lease
the period during which a device can use
assigned IP address Once the lease
expires the device must request a new
one then you have the DNS server the
DHCP server can also provide the
addresses of DNS servers which translate
domain names into IP addresses helping
devices find websites on the internet
then you have the default gateway so
guys the default gateway is a device
that routes traffic from a local network
to the other networks such as Internet
and it is also provided by the DHCP
server then you get options so guys
additional configuration details like
the subnet mask or the time server
information is provided by the DHCP
servers to the client it comes in
options then you get renewal so guys
clients can ask the DHCP server to renew
the lease before it expires ensuring
that they keep their current IP address
so that means renewal then comes
failover we are a backup system where
two DHCP servers work together so if one
fails the other can continue providing
IP addresses to the clients
next is dynamic updates DHCP server can
update DNS records with IP addresses of
the client making it easier to manage
and find network resources next is audit
logging so finally guys DHCP servers
keeps a log of transactions and
administrators to see which devices are
using which IP addresses when the leads
are issued or renewed now let us try to
understand the DHCP packet format so
guys the DHCP packet format consist of
several fields in serving a specific
purpose in the process of assigning IP
addresses and other network informations
to the client the first one is the
hardware length this is a 8bit field
that tells how the physical addresses
like the Mac addresses is in bytes for
example eets whose value is six bytes
then is hop count another 8bit field
that limits how the packet can travel
across a network it defines a maximum
number of hops or transfer from one
network device to the another the packet
is allowed then is a transaction ID it
is a 4 byte field that holds a unique
number created by the client this ID
helps the client and server to match
request with the correct and reply
ensuring that the responses are linked
to the correct requests then there is
number of seconds this is a 16bit field
indicating how many seconds have passed
since the client started trying to
connect to the network it helps track
the time taken during the boot process
then next is Flags it is also a 16bit
field where only the leftmost bit is
used if this bit is set the server is
required to send its reply as a
broadcast message sent to all devices on
the network rather than directly to the
client which is a unicast process and
also the remaining bits should be set to
zero and next is client IP address it is
a 4 byte field that contains the
client's IP addresses if it is already
having one if the client doesn't have an
IP address yet this field will be filled
with zeros then is your IP address this
is a four byte field that will be filled
by the server with the IP address
assigned to the client this field is
used to response to the client request
next is server IP address it is a 4 byte
field that holds the IP addresses of the
DHCP server this field is filled by the
server when responding to a client's
request next is Gateway IP address this
is also a 4 byte field containing the IP
addresses of the router or Gateway the
server fills the field in its reply to
indicate the router through which the
client can access the other networks the
next is client Hardware address this
field contains the physical Mac address
of the client's device although server
can obtain this address from the packet
itself it is more efficient if the
client provides it directly next is
server's name it is a 64 byte field that
can optionally be filled by the server
with its domain name like server.
company. name repeat like server.
company.com if the server doesn't want
to use this field it is also filled with
zeros then there is boot f file name it
is a 128 byte field that the server can
optionally fill with the path to boot a
file this file can help the client
during the boot process if not used the
server fills the field with zeros 13 is
options it is a 64 byte field which is
used to carry additional configuration
informations or specific vendor details
this field is primarily used to reply
messages from the server the server may
include a special identifier called a
magic cookie with the value $99 130.
83.99 that signals the presence of
additional options for the client to
process so guys this is what a DHCP
packet format looks like so guys now let
us try to understand how exactly DHCP
works so the overall process is called
the Dora process so there's a diagram
all over here so guys as you can see in
this diagram so it is showing how a
mobile host client a DHCP relay and a
DHCP server interact during the IP
address assignment process process the
first process is the DHCP discover so
you can see guys the mobile host clients
starts by broadcasting a DHCP discover
message to find available DCP servers
this message is broadcasted to all the
devices on the network to discover if
there is any DHCP server available that
can assign an IP address the DHCP server
follows the path where message travels
from the mobile host to the DHCP relay
and the relay forwards it to the DHCP
server the broadcast nature of the
message ensures that it reaches all the
potential servers the next process is
DHCP offer upon receiving the DHCP disc
discover message the DHCP server
responds with an DHCP offer message the
purpose of this message is that it
contains an IP address and configuration
details that the server is offering to
the client this offer includes IP
address subnet mask Gateway and Lease
time this dscp offer message is a
unicast back to the DHCP relay which
then forwards it to the mobile host the
use of unicast here ensures that the
offer is directly communicated to the
client that it is requested the next is
DHCP request the mobile host upon
receiving the DHCP offer responds with a
DHCP request message this message
indicates that the mobile host has
accepted the offered IP address and
request the server to formally assign it
the client is essentially saying I would
like to use the IP address that you have
offered the DHCP request message is
broadcasted by the mobile host and the
DHCP relay that forwards it to the DHCP
server broadcasting ensures that the
message also reaches to the potential
DHCP servers but it is specifically
intended for one that made the offer now
the next comes DHCP acknowledgement the
DHCP servers after receiving the DHCP
request sends back a DHCP
acknowledgement message the DHCP
acknowledgement confirms that the IP
address has been successfully assigned
to the mobile host and the client can
now use this IP address for network
communication the server also records
the lease time and other configuration
details this DHCP acknowledgement
message is unicast from the server to
the DHCP relay and then mobile Host this
unicast ensures the acknowledgement
directly reaches the requesting clients
the next is duplicate address detection
by address resolution protocol after
mobile host is configured with the IP
address it performs a process that is
known as duplicate address detection
using ARP this step ensures that no
other devices on the network is using
the same IP address the mobile host
sends an ARP request to check if any
device responds with the same IP address
if no device responds the mobile host
confirms that IP address is unique now
the next is DHCP request or lease
renewal as a lease time near expiration
the mobile host sends another DHCP
request message to renew the lease
purpose of this message is that the
request ask a DHCP server to extend the
lease time for the IP address allowing
the mobile host to continue using it
without interruption the lease renewal
request is unicast from mobile host to
the DHCP relay and then to the DHCP
server then you get a DHCP
acknowledgement or the lease renewal
here the DHCP server responds with
another DHCP acknowledgement message to
renew the lease the acknowledgement
message confirms that the lease has been
extended allowing the mobile host to
continue using the assigned IP address
for the extended period this
acknowledgement is again unicast back to
the DHCP relay and then to the mobile
host so guys you can see I've taken an
example suppose here in the mobile host
uh is writing an email to his friend
Jimmy and here all the DCP discover
request process is happening so you can
also see that when this device is
connecting to the network so what kind
of you know IP address is being assigned
and what kind of messages are happening
is it a broadcast or unicast mostly in
the interviews guys the technical
question that they ask is suppose which
message request is a unicast or
broadcast in the process so guys go over
through this and that was all for
