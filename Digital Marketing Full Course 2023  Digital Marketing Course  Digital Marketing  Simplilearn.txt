away meet Joey a digital marketer he
works as the head of digital marketing
for Amazon but but how did Joey get here
a few years ago Joey began to see a
large number of opportunities popping up
in the field of digital marketing to
begin his entry into the field he needed
to understand what exactly digital
marketing was and what was so great
about it first Joey learned that digital
marketing was a form of marketing
through which you could advertise to
people digitally digital marketing
leveraged different channels like search
engines websites social media platforms
emails and mobile applications
it would give marketers the opportunity
to interact with and understand their
audience better and to increase the
trust in their Grant digital marketing
would also show marketers advertisements
to People based on their actions and
preferences on the internet while being
less expensive than traditional forms of
advertising after understanding the main
concepts of digital marketing Joey
realized there was more to digital
marketing than he initially thought
there are also many types of digital
marketing types like content marketing
search engine optimization
payperclick social media marketing email
marketing and affiliate marketing and
once he understood those types he set up
a digital marketing campaign for his
uncle's e-commerce website let's have a
look at what he came up with first Joey
created content like blogs videos
infographics and case studies so that he
could generate audience interest in the
Brand's products or services this was
content marketing next he needed his
audience to actually see his content the
first step was to create content on
specific Search keywords that were
relevant to the target audience Joey
would make optimizations on the website
and have credible websites linking back
to the content and lo and behold the
website began ranking on the first page
of the search results by continuous
optimizations Joey would continue to
improve the ranking and ultimately make
the website rank at the first position
this was SEO or search engine
optimization and Joey could do all of
this without spending a single penny he
could also Drive traffic to the website
with
advertisements but for this he would
have to pay a certain fee each time the
ads were clicked he could have text ads
that show up in search engine results
image ads and video ads that show up in
websites and much more this was possible
with the help of PPC or paperclick
however Joey wasn't done yet to reach a
larger audience he needed to tap into
social media platforms he would use
social media platforms like LinkedIn
then YouTube Facebook and Instagram to
advertise the Brand's content he would
use these platforms to advertise the
Brand's products or services with posts
images videos and more to bring out the
Brand's story and engage with the
Brand's audience who spend a lot of time
on social media like PBC he could use
the platform to advertise the Brand's
products or services with text image and
video ads which needed to be paid for
that's social media marketing Joey
realized that a large large amount of
the audience weren't visiting the
Brand's website a second time he needed
to keep them engaged nurture them to
make sure they purchased the product for
this he would send them emails that help
them better understand the products they
visited on the website and assist them
in the buying process he would also send
emails to advertise his products or
services to potential customers that is
with email marketing and finally
although Joey was able to grow the
Brand's funnel he wanted more traffic
from thirdparty websites this could be
achieved with a affiliate marketing
Affiliates would promotee the brand or
product to their audiences for a fee
with the help of email signups
registrations conversions subscriptions
Etc after setting all of this up Joey
had the hardest part of the process to
get through the waight now as we wait
for the results let's take a break and
look at a quiz which one of the
following forms of marketing involves

part of the video average salty of a

high a digital marketing manager earns
approximately 6 lakh 72,000 per year in
India and in the US he or she can earn
roughly
$75,000 per
year okay let's talk about the customer
life cycle so we know why we want to do
digital marketing we want to know we
want we know what the digital marketing
channels are CU we just talked about
them from SEO to social to affiliate to
mobile content to sem okay you have a
lot of different digital marketing
channels at your disposal so now how do
we go ahead and approach our customers
so that's what we're going to talk about
first so we're going to talk about
different stages of the customer life
cycle okay and the first one is the
awareness stage so we need to get our
customers aware of what we're selling or
what we're promoting okay so the
awareness stage is really what product
does your brand offer that's a question
we want to get out there and we want to
answer okay what does a customer need
your product or excuse me why does a
customer need your product that's a
question we want to answer with digital
marketing okay what solution does your
product provide okay that's an answer to
a question we want to make sure people
understand so these are questions that
we want to be able to answer in the form
of digital marketing whether that be
mobile or content okay so getting our
information out there that answers these
essential questions and if we could do
that then somebody's going to become
aware of our product or service okay so
what product does our brand offer why
does a customer need it and what
solution does it provide okay those are
some key questions that people tend to
ask themselves when they look at a brand
okay and when they look at a product hey
do I really need this is it going to
help me in my life okay and who who is
selling this I mean who was this brand I
mean that's those are just things that
run through people's mind intuitively
that with the right messaging the right
channel the right type of asset the
right targeted audience you can quickly
make somebody aware of your Brand's
product or service in this stage it's
help potential customers discover your
brand with the help of these different
marketing channels so in the awareness
stage you know content is key so it's to
me if we have a website we need a Blog
because if somebody does come to our
blog from say organic search SEO then we
can write about that product or service
via blog and and talk to our customer
talk directly to our targeted audience
through that blog and if we're not
ranking organically we can use paid
search to promote it because paid search
on Google for example basically we can
be right at the top of the search
results and so somebody can actually see
it when they do a search because we know
millions of people you search on a daily
basis you could do social media
marketing okay so you can publish that
product or service on Facebook while
you're building your community and you
can use affiliate marketing to help get
the word out by using cj.com as an
example build up a sales force of people
these Publishers that are going to put
your product or service out there so to
me in the awareness stage these are the
the digital marketing channels you could
focus on now I will say one thing about
display ads display is part of search
engine marketing you could use display
because you can reach a large number of
people so even though it's listed here
low priority in the awareness stage
display ADS mean that if you go on
Google's Display Network you could pick
and choose your sites your demographics
keywords topics an audience you can
focus on all those different
demographics to really attract a large
number of people so low priority but
it's probably also good to focus on in
the awareness stage so content marketing
you must create a high quality content
that people are searching for without
content it's hard to get found and so to
me this is you know where the blog comes
in SEO take that content get it
optimized okay SCM if we're not ranking
organically we can make sure we're at
the top of the paid search results or
the the search results for particular
keyword we want to be found for and then
social media marketing using different
channels depending on the channel we're
selling you know training like simply
learned does you know LinkedIn is a good
platform for us okay and then affiliate
you know basically building up a nice
network of Publishers to get the word
out so these are all good channels that
we can focus in on so traffic sources
may include paid unpaid social referral
display email or direct so they they
they could come in the awareness stage
from all different types of channels
even though you're focused on content I
mean you could still get traffic from
mobile or email so now that we got the
word out via all these different
marketing channels there's that
consideration stage so you know people
are aware of us now they're considering
us and that's kind of the next stage in
the process okay so a few essential
questions to address on the
consideration stage hey what features
make your product valuable to others and
how will I increase customer engagement
towards my product so those are answers
to questions you want to ask okay what
features make your product valuable you
want to basically separate yourself from
the competition basically that's what
you're trying to answer okay so if
you're promoting your product or service
on paid search and other people are
bidding on the same keyword how are you
going to stand out and then how will I
increase customer engagement towards my
product so for example if you're on
Facebook Facebook okay and you're trying
to get people over to your site to
purchase your product then how you going
to improve that engagement you got to
create something really snazzy or really
it's going to be attention grabbing or
something that's going to get them to
become aware of it that's going to
separate your post from all the other
posts that are in somebody's Facebook
Newsfeed okay so you really have to work
hard to really convince somebody to get
their consideration towards your product
or service so in this stage your
customer considers your product so help
them understand how your product is
valuable okay to me email works really
good here because if you have a targeted
audience this gives you the opportunity
to really answer this questions in that
particular Channel email you could
support that with a promotion and
display I think display is a good option
here too because even though you know
people are trying to become aware you
know you can really hone in and really
get them to take that next step okay
with display you can even do remarketing
so if somebody's been to your site
because they're aware of your product
they're curious you can cookie them and
remarket to them via display so display
to me is a good a good channel to use
here okay so you have email mobile
display you know sem these are all you
know good channels to use on the
consideration stage especially on search
because somebody's looking for something
and they're aware of your brand then
you have the good opportunity to get
them to click on your ad especially if
you're offering a promotion and get them
to convert the goal here is to increase
our engagement so people are aware we're
moving them further along the funnel
with email marketing we have the
opportunity to promote the product by
sending an email directly to our
audience so with this stage plan your
campaigns around welcome emails
newsletters we can talk about product
descriptions add ratings and reviews in
the email you know we really just want
to encourage people to purchase the
product that's we're trying to sway them
over so email is a good source to allow
us to do that so with mobile marketing
we can promote the products by sending
relevant messages to our target audience
display again retargeting because we can
retarget an audience that has been to
our website already did some research
about our brand our product or service
and now we're going to reach back out to
them to sway them so remember we want to
encourage customers to buy a product by
creating detailed articles about the
product that always helps and that's
content okay we want to opt for a
customer testimonial okay that helps
sway people and add some guest blogging
okay we can have ambassadors blog on our
behalf or we can go out and blog on
somebody else's site okay so blogging
works both ways it's ways of of showing
yourself and telling people hey we know
you're looking for this product here's
why you want to choose us okay moving on
from the consideration to the purchase
stage so they're aware of you they're
considering you and now we're on to the
purchase stage so the questions we want
to really make sure we address here are
how are my prices compared to my
competitors and is my brand more
credible than others okay so they're
considering you but that price point and
it may not even be the price it could be
the shipping for example the price could
be good but the shipping cost could be
high so you really want to do some do
diligence and research on what your
competitors are doing credibility that
goes back to the consideration stage and
testimonials you want to make sure you
have reviews and testimonials to really
Elevate what you're trying to tell
customers and that that is hey I have a
good brand I have a good product I have
a good service come buy my stuff come
buy my product and service but you
really need to support that claim you
just can't go out and say it and so
supporting that comes in the form of
what other people say and that could be
reviews that could be comments on a
social media platform it could be you
know stars on say Yelp or Google my
business you know make sure you do you
due diligence and make sure you get
people to you know review you or provide
testimonials
because people are going to do their due
diligence before they purchase
especially if it's on Google my business
or Yelp or Trip Advisor whatever it is
you're trying to sell they're going to
be able to see those reviews and so do
your due diligence to get the reviews
and if it is a negative review hey
that's okay you can't please everyone
you're going to get them that's the
world we live in just make sure you show
your upper hand and respond even to the
negative as well as the positive reviews
that you get that actually bodess well
to some people because hey it shows that
I made a mistake and you're willing to
correct it and so people actually see
that that could be the Tipping Point to
getting them to purchase say look hey
this brand really cares because they're
really responding to people they're not
ignoring negativity okay just the small
things that can get people to change
their mind now with the purchase stage
according to EC consultancy 83% of the
online audience require encouragement to
complete a purchase encouragement what
does that mean well could mean providing
a promo giving them that extra incentive
you know if you don't offer promo
consider it especially on the email and
the example we looked at earlier sending
out an email means that if the promo is
going to an at midnight send that email
out and tell people they have until
midnight and if they purchase today
you'll leave increase it to 20% and
email is a good channel for that mobile
can reach a lot of people through sms
okay social media reaching people
instantaneously and then you know really
with the purchase stage it gives Pro
Prospects an offer to help them make
that purchase so you have plenty of
channels to choose from in fact most of
these channels the only one really that
doesn't fit the instantaneous mode is
SEO but you can really focus on
affiliate even though that's a little
priority here you can really you know
coordinate with your Publishers who
especially those Publishers that have
proven their worth and have sold your
products in the past you know get them
to help promote it and incentivize Their
audience so let's move on from the
purchase to the P post purchase stage so
this is after somebody
purchases okay so some essential
questions we want to be able to address
here so what additional product could my
customer buy now that they're my
customer what else could I sell them
what you know without being too pushy
could if they buy a coat well a hat work
or a pair of gloves or you know a blouse
you know you want to be able to you not
push a product on a customer but think
about how you can complement that
purchasers that purchasers or customers
product and then how to improve the
customer buying experience so again this
goes back to you know what we just said
about reviews get somebody to offer a
review and if they don't give you a full
com compliment of five stars they only
give you three and a half stars then you
know what that's great feedback because
then you can learn from that and then
the other question is will the customer
refers to others and if so why so that's
definitely something you want to be able
to address in the post purchase stage so
let's take a look here so with post
purchasing stage you know to me emails
at the top of this list because if
somebody purchases something you could
send a nice thank you email because if
they purchase they're giving you their
email in return because you're likely
going to be sending them the receipt via
email so email to me is a nice Channel
you send in a nice message even you know
social media you know you can thank your
community for supporting you on this
recent campaign that you ran you know
even throw in an extra five or 10% on a
future purchase is a thank you and
that's easily done on social media you
know you could even post a blog you know
promote
you know the success of a product and
then offering a promotion okay so
there's a lot of things you could be
doing here on the postp purchasing stage
so to me even looking at content again
you could even you know put a survey
together you could even put a survey
together for your Affiliates okay you
could even post a poll on Facebook so
it's just working in with these
different channels to get some feedback
about your product and service so with
email mobile you can engage customers
with followup emails or customer care
content you know with mobile if you have
somebody's mobile number hey text them a
simple thank you goes a long way you
know you could say hey look if you're
satisfied let us know give us a call you
can even in the E mobile text message
you can put a link to a survey send
emails to active subscribers give
rewards for customer feedback so if
somebody does provide feedback give them
an extra 10 % off you know you want to
be able to reward loyalty loyalty comes
in the form of a partnership if you're
giving somebody discounts and you have a
good product or service then they're
going to recognize that they're going to
say hey look I really like this product
and they're giving me 10% I'm going to
go ahead and purchase from these guys
again so give those discounts to those
active customers or on the affiliate
netw give referral opportunities to your
customers so if it's an affiliate
publisher hey if they're getting people
to your site you know reward them or if
it's an email and you put a for to a
friend get an extra 10% off it doesn't
hurt because you're incentivizing people
to help you sell your product so with
social display and content use those
banner ads or use that content that you
display on social or the blog you're
going to write to give customers advice
in order to maximize the value of their
purchase so again you can use these
platforms to also enhance uh what they
purchased so hey you just purchased this
product thank you very much did you know
you could do this this and this with it
and so that's the idea of a post-p
purchase stage is to maximize these
channels to be able to answer those
essential questions about what else
could they purchase you know do they
like how do I be get these people to
become loyal customers okay so with the
first purchase stage if a customer has
bought a pair of sport shoes for example
running shoes you can recommend cross
product sale or cross sale it could be a
pair of shorts or a water bottle or an
accessory with an exclusive discount so
that's another example what you can do
on the postp purchase stage so when we
want to go and promote our product or
service using a campaign we have
different options so there are different
types of digital marketing channels that
we can choose from and let's just go
through that list of digital marketing
channels and the first one is what I
consider the king of them all and that's
SEO so SEO stands for search engine
optimization there's search engine
marketing there's email marketing
affiliate marketing social content
mobile and then we can get into subsets
of each of these digital marketing
channels but really we'll start with SEO
because that's the king and to me that's
basically increasing the quality and
quantity of relevant organic traffic on
the search in engines including Google
so depending on where you're located in
the US market Google tends or has a
large market share so you want your
pages on your website to be found and
clicked on organically and so that means
if somebody types in a keyword you want
that relevant page to show up first on
Google so somebody can click on that
link okay and we know that millions of
people specifically in the US but
worldwide you search on a daily basis so
if you're rank for those relevant key
words you can imagine how much traffic
you can get okay so that's SEO okay and
here's an example so you type in online
shopping well you can see the first
listing here is a paid search ad we're
going to get to that in a minute the
second organically is Amazon okay so
online shopping you think maybe Walmart
you think maybe Alibaba or you're
thinking probably Amazon okay so no
surprise Amazon's ranking for the
keyword online shopping and so if
somebody clicked on their listing that's
traffic for Amazon let's move on to
search engine marketing you know known
as sem or pay per click or cost per
click or PPC or CPC or sponsored search
or Google ads I mean there's a lot of
different names synonymous with sem so
search engine marketing is really just
using paid ads on search engines just as
we saw the previous example if you want
to be found for keyword you don't have
to worry about organic if you're willing
to pay for it you just bid on that
keyword and voila you have the
opportunity to appear number one in the
search results at the top of the page
for that keyword now when somebody
clicks on it you have to pay Google if
it's Google you're advertising on but
that's the beauty of search engine
marketing you can bid on keywords and
appear at the top of the search results
for that keyword example here if we go
back to online shopping well my
us.com is bidding on that keyword online
shopping so they're actually appearing
above Amazon's organic listing but
that's what they want to do they want to
be found for that keyword so if they're
not ranking for it organically well
they're bidding on it and if somebody
happen to clicked on that listing then
my us.com is going to pay Google Google
something depending on what the cost per
click is and so that could be anywhere
from one penny to $100 it depends
depends on the keyword depends on who
else is bidding on the keyword depends
on the location depends on the time of
day depends on quality score there a lot
of factors involved and regarding what
you pay however the benefit of sem is
visibility and getting traffic to your
website for keyword you're not found for
so that's why sem is such a popular
choice for a lot of companies okay let's
talk about digital marketing that's a
traditional type of digital marketing
channel it's been around a long time you
know we all send emails on a daily basis
and we probably all receive emails on a
daily basis just is an effective way to
capture leads and convert them to
customers because with email you can
personalize your emails and you can send
your emails to a segmented audience okay
okay so if you have emails from females
who are 35 years of age to 44 that live
in say the southern part of the United
States you can segment that send them an
email and cater that email directly to
that audience and of course you can put
some nice call to action in there you
can design it really snazzy and you
could track it just like you can any
other digital marketing channel so email
is a very effective way to really reach
target audience because everybody for
the most part has a functioning email
account so basically here's an example
of an email that could go out you're
selling a product and the product's
promotion is about to end well you know
get that email out to your target
audience let them know hey you have
until tonight to purchase product and if
you purchase it you're going to get 30%
off and you can put the coupon code
right in there with a nice call to
action and you can measure how many many
people click on that email go to that
web page and purchase the product using
that coupon code so that's an example of
email marketing okay we have affiliate
marketing so affiliate marketing is an
effective way for digital marketers to
basically create a Salesforce of people
so basically what you're doing is you're
getting Merchants to promote your
products and services and you're using
usually a third party broker like
Commission Junction or cj. as an example
to introduce you the the person selling
the product the merchant with the
affiliate so that affiliate could likely
be a merchant him or himself and they
can basically be a good partner of yours
by publishing your product or service on
their website so that they can sell and
order to get commissions so it's all
based on a commission so you basically
are going to use a third party affiliate
like CJ get all these Affiliates to work
for you they're going to promote your
product or service if they do sell your
product or service you're going to pay
him a commission that's more or less how
it works with affiliate marketing and
you know with affiliate marketing to me
it's a good way to you know really
promote your product or service and you
can pick and choose the Affiliates or
the Publishers of whom you want to work
with so here's an example of affiliate
marketing at work okay okay you
basically see a banner basically you
could see earn up to 12% advertising
fees with a trusted e-commerce leader
okay so if somebody clicked on that
purchased for example or joined you
could pay off that commission okay let's
turn our attention to social media
marketing so social media marketing you
know I wouldn't say it's fairly new I
mean if I think about it we're in
2019 and I remember talking about
Facebook back in 2006 so you're talking
about 13 14 15 years of social media
it's definitely evolved over the years
and but the concept Remains the Same it
involves creating different types of
content depending on the platform okay
so you could be on Pinterest or
Instagram and be dealing with photos or
you could be on Twitter tweeting out
certain characters up to a limit okay so
it really depends on the social media
platform uh that really drives the type
of content you're going to promote but
we know social media can be effective
because people use social media I mean
Facebook is one of the more popular
platforms and if you want to get your
product or service out there you could
certainly pay to have an ad on Facebook
or you could just post your content
organically okay that's the beauty of
social most of your Social platforms
like LinkedIn and Twitter and Facebook
and Pinterest and Instagram they all
have a paid form of advertising that you
can use to promote your product or
service or you you can go the organic
route and you know post content
organically in hopes of driving traffic
back to your website so with social you
do have two options here but social is
interesting because there a lot of
different social media platforms out
there really depends on your product or
service okay so an example of social
media marketing especially on Facebook
with Facebook you got mobile and desktop
and you obviously have the opportunity
to post something organically and have
that liked or commented on or shared or
you can post an ad and get that liked
commented or shared or clicked and have
people go back to your website and
fulfill the goal of what you want them
to do so moving on to content marketing
so content marketing is really an
effective way of really Distributing
valuable content online and when we talk
about content marketing you know we're
talking about different types of assets
so it could be simply text in the form
of a blog post or it could be a video or
it could be an an infographic or it
could be an image okay there are lots of
ways to create content these days
especially in digital marketing and the
great thing about content marketing is
you're writing content for a targeted
audience so if you're trying to Target
an audience on say Instagram then you
know who your audience is and you know
what the type of content you're going to
post on there so it could be in the form
of a video or infographic or just a
graphic and so that's the beauty of
content marketing really putting
yourself out there um and depending on
the platform putting yourself out there
with various types of content so for
example we look at YouTube you could see
this video here about digital marketing
certified associate well hey you don't
need to always write the content you can
produce the content in the form of a
video and post it on YouTube this is a
form of content marketing so that's
content marketing and then let's talk
about mobile marketing so content
marketing again different types but if
we go now to mobile marketing you can
kind of segue from content to mobile
because the only difference here is with
mobile it's strictly on mobile phone
it's not desktop so mobile marketing is
really a strategy on its own that helps
you the company promoting your product
or service to reach your target audience
through a mobile device and that
includes tablets and how you could do
that is via messaging you could do it
via email or you could be do it via an
app okay so you have different ways of
getting your content out there to people
okay so as an example you can use
basically SMS or instant message
messaging via mobile devices to promote
your product or service here's another
example of a mobile marketing via app
install and so you can even compound
that by running a say Google ad as an
example and running your Google ad on
say just mobile you could do a bit
adjustment just for mobile and the goal
could be app installs okay so and you
can even do a mobile or app extension so
there's lots of ways to really promote
your app or your product or your service
Via mobile marketing Rachel is a baker
who runs her own Bakery to expand her
business she decided to create an online
presence by first setting up a Blog she
began posting on her blog regularly
however even after regularly posting on
the blog there were barely any visitors
showing up deciding not to give up
Rachel began searching for a solution on
the internet that's when she came across
SEO or search engine optimization a term
she's never heard before so let's take a
journey together and help her learn
about SEO search engine optimization is
a method that could improve the quality
and quantity of the audience coming to
Rachel's website from search engines it
could increase brand awareness attract
local customers and build credibility
and trust and all of this is possible
without having to spend a single penny
to bring visitors to our website it
Rachel would have to take advantage of
the two types of SEO onpage and off-page
SEO Rachel first decides to tackle
onpage SEO and get that sorted onpage
SEO involved Rachel optimizing her
website both in terms of content and the
technical aspects including the HTML
source code schema metatags and more she
started off by using tools like Google
AdWords rref and semrush to identify
popular Search terms associated with the
recipes she planned to publish on her
blog she began to look for Search terms
related to the broader area of baking
cooking and related topics once she
found these Search terms she began to
incorporate them into her recipes she
started off by providing an introduction
to the recipe with this she could
provide an engaging beginning to her
story like how the dish reminded her of
her childhood and enabled her to
naturally include the Search terms into
the blog she also included these
keywords in the actual recipe as well
well additionally she added pictures
videos time-lapses and more to increase
credibility and engagement for her
content and subsequently persuading
search engines to show her content to
more people after this she moved to the
website meta content that search engines
display when her blog appears in search
results she optimized The Meta tags alt
tags header Tags and More this completed
the onpage aspect of SEO thanks to this
she saw a significant increase in the
number of visitors coming to her page
having done all she could on her web
page she now decides to explore what
could be done off page to improve her
Page's visibility on search engines
off-page SEO involved Rachel doing
things outside her site page to help
increase its search engine rankings
making optimizations outside the site
would improve the site's popularity
relevance trustworthiness and Authority
this is possible with the help of
reputable websites vouching for your
content with backlinks social media
marketing guest blogging linked UNL
brand mentions influencer marketing and
much more Rachel also understood that
for her content to reach people she
would have to promote it on social media
platforms like Facebook Twitter and
Instagram as well as Niche platforms
like quora Reddit and medium these could
help her achieve greater reach for her
website by sending stronger social
signals to search engines leading to the
page being shown as highly relevant for
related searches and audiences and even
after understanding and implementing all
of this Rachel had just scratched the
surface of what was possible with SEO
before we find out what she did next
let's have a look at a quiz which of the
following is the most effective way to
improve off-page SEO one creating plenty
of web pages of a Content two getting
backlinks from relevant and
authoritative sites three acquiring
backlinks through link buying four none
of the above let us know your answer in
the comment section below for a chance
to win an Amazon voucher now let's go
back to Rachel Rachel decided to take up
simply learn's digital marketing
certification with classes covering just
about everything she needed to know
about SEO it was only a matter of time
before Rachel began to implement her
learnings on her website and CM massive
uptick in the number of viewers coming
to her website in time she could even
earn money off the site by setting up an
online shop and with that we've covered
an introduction to the concepts of SEO
and the possibilities it can open for
you either as a marketer or a business
owner let's dive deep into types of
SEO that
is on page
SEO off page
SEO and Technical
SEO we will start with on page SEO
optimizing a web page to gain visibility
and rank high in search results and get
relevant traffic is known as onpage SEO
some onpage SEO techniques include
optimizing
content adding attractive titles and
meta
descriptions adding internal and
external links on the web page adding
SSL certifications for the
website optimizing in images for search
results Etc next is off-page SEO actions
taken outside the web page or a website
to rank high in search results is known
as off-page
SEO some off-page SEO techniques include
building back
links blogging and submitting articles
on other websites promoting content on
social media Etc
and the last one is technical SEO

website such that search engines can
easily crawl and index the web pages is
known as technical
SEO some technical optimizations include
reducing the page loading speed of a web
page to a
minimum submitting site maps to search
engines have organized website structure
as it informs search engines about the
essential pages of the
website adding redirections for the
deleted URLs or temporarily moving
URLs identify duplicate content and
replace it with unique content greetings
everyone this is Rob Sanders from Simply
learn and today we're going to talk
about keyword research so what are we
going to talk about when we talk about
keyword research we're going to talk
about why we would do keyword research
for SEO we're going to talk about the
types of keywords that we need to
research we're going to talk about some
methodologies best practices on how to
do keyword research some alternate
suggestions we're going to talk about
keyword clustering and then we're going
to talk about some tools that you can
use to do your keyword research so let's
start with the why we would do keyword
research so Jesse is planning to publish
a Blog of pizza recipes so she was doing
pizza recipes step by step pizza recipes
with sausage homemade pizza toppings
pizza dough recipes think Crest pizzas
she's doing a lot of different topics on
pizza recipes well what Jesse needs to
do is understand what's going to drive
traffic to these blog posts if she's
writing about you know different topics
around pizza recipes so she's Unsure how
these blogs are going to drive traffic
so she really needs to understand that
hey you need to choose the right
keywords to drive traffic so the
question is if you're writing a blog
post about recipes with sausages is
pizza recipes with sausages or recipes
for free the best keyword to use maybe
maybe not so you need to take uh care in
choosing the key wordss to align with
your content so that's really the idea
why we would do keyword research because
some of the issues with keywords that
are poorly chosen are they could have
low search volume for example you may
choose a keyword that just a lot of
people aren't using to search for or
they can be highly competitive so if you
choose a keyword that's very broad or
popular it can be very competitive and
take you a long time to be found for
that keyword or you could just make the
mistake of choosing a keyword that isn't
align with your content or you can
choose keywords but use them incorrectly
with your content so these are some of
the issues that you can encounter if you
just go about choosing keywords randomly
without due diligence without the proper
research so low search volume will lead
to less traffic High competition you may
not even rank at all okay if somebody
find you for a keyword that's not
relevant to the topic they're just going
to leave the page and if you're not
using the right keywords and or if you
are using the right keywords and not
using them correctly in the content then
your pages may not even be found in
organic search so you really have to
take care and choosing the keywords to
me that's the most important step with
SEO is keyword research so we're going
to talk about the types of keyword
research then so we have short tail
keywords and we have longtail keyword so
if you write a blog post about pizza
recipes well what are you going to
choose a short tail or long tail so
let's talk about short tail keywords
first so short tail keywords are
keywords that are usually three key
wordss in a phrase or shorter in some
cases it may be two key wordss in a
phrase or shorter so short tail keywords
usually have high search volume which
means likely means higher competition
but what it also means it could be lower
conversions because short tail key words
like for example pizza recipes could be
considered a short-tail key word but
maybe somebody's looking for homemade
pizza recipes or pizza recipes from
their favorite Italian restaurant so
short TIY words may not be as relevant
so if we compare it with longtail
keywords chances are you're going to
have lower competition that's one of the
benefits but you're also going to have
lower search volume but with longer tail
keywords the keyword is probably going
to be more relevant with the content
you're writing about so therefore the
conversion rates likely going to be
higher so that's really the difference
between short tail keywords and longtail
keywords if you want to look it
simplistically short tail keywords are
Broad in nature it's going to capture a
lot of eyeballs but those eyeballs may
look at your content is not relevant
versus long tail keywords that may be
very relevant but not as many eyeballs
on them so short tail keywords the
characteristics they're not as specific
usually they're less than three words
they have high search volume and high
competition so if you just choose pizza
recipes could take you a while to rank
for that keyword but when you rank
you're going to get the traffic but
again it may not convert because the key
word is Broad in nature so pizza recipes
is a short-tail key word word that may
not be exactly what you're writing about
in your blog post so it may draw a lot
of traffic but the traffic may not do
anything so the longer tail keywords are
very specific they consist of more than
three words in the search query they
have relatively low search volume
competition so the chance of you ranking
higher faster for that long T key word
is probably going to be greater because
not many other websites are trying to
rank for that same key word and so the
benefit of that is if you have let's
just say homemade pizza recipes with
mushrooms that's a long tiky word but if
somebody's looking for that type of
pizza recipe then you know you're going
to track the right traffic and chances
are that traffic is going to engage or
convert based on the type of conversion
you have in place so example would be
homemade pizza dough recipes that'd be
another example more than th key words
in the phrase very specific we're
talking about home H made pizza dough
recipe so we're not talking about just
pizza recipes so it's a little bit more
uh specific in nature longer tail so
these keywords are used for targeted
Pages including blog post if you're
writing a blog post specifically about
pizza recipes with homemade dough then
this is the keyword you likely would
want to use versus just pizza recipes so
let's look at an example between a short
tail keyword and a long tail keyword and
to accentuate the differences we're
going going to use Google's Keyword
Planner tool so Google's Keyword Planner
tool is located in Google ads the Google
ads platform and when you're in the
Google ads platform you can simply click
on tools and then Keyword Planner and so
what Keyword Planner allows us to do is
get a sense of the type of volume that a
particular keyword has so what Google's
Keyword Planner does is they show you
the average monthly searches this is the
average monthly search volume of the key
word over the past 12 months and so in
this example we're going to choose pizza
recipes and homemade pizza dough recipes
so one short tail and one long tail so
we enter those keywords in we're going
to click get results and what Google's
going to do is it's going to show us the
volume of those keywords so for pizza
recipe we could see the average monthly
search volume is
33,100 for pizza recipe so note that
pizza recipe and pizza recipes are
closely related keywords and so what
Google does is they consider that a
close variance so meaning if somebody
ties in pizza recipe then they're also
in Google's eyes looking for pizza
recipes so it's a close variance and so
for the keyword pizza recipe which is
short tail we could see on average over
the past 12 months this keyword received
33,100 queries and so if we hover over
the graph we could see basically the
volume the average volume per month so
here I could see for this particular
keyword here the volume per month is 33
1,000 and then I can see the actual
volume over the past 12 months and then
for the longtail keyword I can see
homemade pizza dough recipe again close
variance homemade pizza dough recipes I
can see over the past 12 months what the
search volume is for this on average
it's 2400 but I could see here in
December the volume went up to 3600 but
for example in May it was 1,00 so it's
going to fluctuate a bit over the past
12 months but on average it's about 2400
so shorter tail lot of more volume
longer tail not as much volume but
nonetheless there is volume here and so
these are the differences between a
short tail and a longer tail and so what
Google's Keyword Planner also does is
allow us to get a sense of what the comp
ition is and so here I can see the
competition is low for both of these
keywords fair enough so we now know that
if we want to optimize or choose the
keyword homemade pizza dough recipe for
our blog post we know for ranked on page
one of Google even in the top spot we
can expect about 2400 search queries for
that keyword now whether you get all
2400 clicks for that keyword remains to
be seen chances are you're not going to
get all 2400 you're going to get a lion
share of those clicks but you're going
to at least get some volume on it so
even the longer TI keywords have a lot
of Promise because there is some search
volume here for this keyword how to do a
proper keyword research so we looked at
Google's Keyword Planner tool in Google
ads and we typed in two keywords and we
were able to get a sense of what the
average volume is so we definitely want
to choose key words based on the
following factors we want to choose it
based on C volume search volume is a
good indicator of the potential traffic
we can obtain so again for the key word
homemade pizza dough recipe we know that
it averages 2400 a month in search
volume again we may not get all 2400 but
are we going to get a line share that we
also need to look at competition and so
Google's Keyword Planner gives us a high
medium or low in terms of the
competition but if you're somebody who
wants to get a better sense of what the
competition is and you should because
competition is a key component in
choosing keywords and so what I want to
do is get a sense of how many people are
actually optimizing for that keyword so
Google's Keyword Planner tool is going
to give me a low medium high really what
I want to do is get a better sense of
that numerically so what I can do is go
into Google search and I could type in
pizza recipes and I could see there's
about 1 billion results that's a lot of
results results however that means that
every potential web page out there on
the internet that mentions piz of
recipes is going to be included in this
number here and so I want to get a
better sense of who's optimizing for
pizza recipes so I'm going to put in the
all and tile syntax and so what that is
going to ask Google to do is tell me all
the websites that have pizza recipes the
keyword pizza recipes in the title tag
so if I do all enti tile colon space
than pizza recipes my result drops down
to 336,000 so what that tells me is that
there are 336,000 results with the
keyword pizza recipes in the title tag
now if I want to focus in on my other
keyword if I choose uh my other keyword
was a longer tail keyword homemade pizza
dough recipe so if I type that keyword
in the homemade pizza dough recipe or
recipes remember post variants and I
just click enter or type the keyword in
hit my enter key I'm going to get 35
Million results but again is that really
an indicator of the type of competition
I have no because every listing that
mentiones homade pizza dough recipes is
going to be included in the search
results so I'm going to type in my all
en tile colon space and then I'm going
to get a better sense of how many
websites have the keyword homemade pizza
dough recipes in the title tag and I get
2,160 different results so here I can
see the first result in the title tag
homemade pizza dough recipe second one
homemade pizza dough recipe so these are
sites or web pages that have that
keyword in the title tag so now I have a
numerical number to work with and so the
thing you have to understand about SEO
specifically about keyword research is
you need to do research on a few
different keywords not just one or two
so what we want to do is have a
spreadsheet the spreadsheet is going to
contain keywords that we can potentially
want to optimize for choose as keywords
to optimize for SEO and so my
recommendation is you come up with a
theme first so the theme for us in this
exercise is pizza recipes and so that's
our theme so we chose the keyword pizza
recipes so the close experience here is
pizza recipe what was the volume well we
know the volume was 33 3,100 for pizza
recipe so what are we going to do we're
going to put that number in in our
volume column what was the competition
well if we go back and type in pizza
recipes it was 683 th000 so I'm going to
type in
683 th000 what was our next keyword well
it was pizza or homemade pizza dough
recipes so if I go back for this
particular keyword is 2400 so I'm going
to put 2400 in under my volume column
and then what was my compet comption
well my competition was I type that
keyword back in 2,160 so I'm going to
put
2,160 so now I have an idea of what kind
of volume and what kind of competition I
have now you want to do this for a
number of different keywords and when
you do it for number keywords what you
do want to do is obviously choose a
relevant keyword that has high volume
and low competition so another way of
saying it is the volume or ratio of
volume to competition and so basically
what we could do is take volume divided
by competition if I make that a
percentage I can see it's 35% is the
ratio between volume and competition if
I do the same for my longer tail keyword
2400 / 2160 I can see that 111% so this
just kind of proves the point that yeah
I'm still going to get some volume but I
have a better chance of ranking for this
longer T ke word home made pizza dough
recipes so you want to be able to do
that for number keywords and examine the
volume the competition and the ratio
between volume and competition for your
themed keywords in this case pizza
recipes so relevancy you want to choose
keywords that are very relevant to the
content that you're writing and then
again commercial intent what keywords
are going to drive more conversions and
revenue for the business so when we talk
about commercial intent we're talking
about you know are you choosing keyword
that are going to get somebody to do
what you want them to do so we could say
You Know download pizza dough recipes so
somebody's typing in the keyword
download pizza dough recipes then
chances are they're going to find you
come to your side and take action by
downloading that pizza D recipe so you
want to be able to also think about the
intent of the keyword is it going to
help you drive conversions and revenue
if you're an e-commerce site so search
volume is the average month please
search volume made for a particular
keyword and phrase so we can get that
number using Google's Keyword Planner
tool in the Google ads platform we want
to Target keywords with high search
volume that will help bring traffic to
the website we want volume but we want
to take into account seasonality as well
so that's where the Google's Keyword
Planner tool comes in place because if
we go back again we can just hover over
we can get a sense of any particular
Trend going on or season
so for example if I saw large growth in
the winter months and not much volume
growth in the summer months then that
might indicate to me that this keyword
is more popular during the winter time
so pay attention to the graphs that you
know the Keyword Planner tool gives you
use them to your advantage to take into
account seasonality so a good example
would be funny Halloween costumes well
we know that for Halloween you're going
to have a spike probably towards the end
of September all the way through October
and then it's going to drop after
October 31st which is Halloween so
that's an example but in the case of
pizza recipes you know you may find that
more people are choosing to search for
pizza recipes during maybe the summer
months versus the winter months so pay
attention to seasonality it will affect
search volume so competition based on
our example it's one of the most
important key metrics you don't want to
choose a key word that's highly
competitive because if it's competitive
then it's going to be harder to rank
number one or even on page one of Google
depending on competitive it is so high
search volume low competition in other
words the ratio between the two is the
ideal combination so going back to the
spreadsheet recommend you have that
spreadsheet handy put your theme in
place okay theme pizza recipes we use
Google's Keyword Planner tool to find
the volume we use the all entitle syntax
to find the competition so we entered
both of those numbers in and we get our
ratio and so when you have these numbers
for a number different keywords you want
to be able to choose that ratio of high
volume low competition but always
relevancy always trumps ratio so always
go with a keyword that is going to be
relevant to your content don't choose a
keyword that's not relevant if you
choose a keyword that's not relevant
it's not going to bode well for user
engagement so the difficulty of a
keyword ranges from 0 to 100 in Google's
keyword tool so it's going to be easy
it's going to be medium it's going to be
hard but my recommendation is also to
get the numerical factor and that's the
all and title syntax and again relevancy
is what drives the traffic to your
website and keep the traffic there on
your website and also not only will it
keep the traffic on your website but
hopefully get that traffic to engage and
convert so that's the key about
relevancy you always want to choose
keywords that are relevant to your
content even if it's sacrificing volume
relevancy again trumps volume and
competition so always choose relevant
keywords first so when you do that
you're always almost guaranteeing that
at some point somebody's going to find
your content because somebody out there
might be looking for it and if they do
you're going to get found and then the
engagement is going to be better so
understand your business find keyword
that are relevant to your business and
then focus on those key words that'll
help you with getting the right traffic
to your site always keep in mind the
commercial intent so these keywords are
more specific and result in conversion
rate for example buying is a good
commercial intent keyword so if you
really want somebody to come to your
website and buy then focus on those
types of keywords in the case of the
pizza recipes maybe it's download could
be our commercial intent keyword again
there may be low search volume but those
are the type of keywords you want to
focus on because that's the type of
traffic you want to drive to your site
so some other examples of commercial
intent keywords or discount deal your
coupon shipping you don't don't be
afraid to use some of these keywords as
part of your longer tail keyword phrase
again the volume may not be high but the
traffic quality is probably going to be
better so keyword research is the
foundation for SEO so if you have chosen
your keywords properly then if you do
get ranked for those keywords then it's
going to lead to better engagement with
some conversions and so when we talk
about keywords we also want to talk
about our primary and secondary keyword
so every page should have at least a
primary keyword and then a secondary
keyword to work with so primary keywords
are really defining the nature of your
content the secondary keywords are
relevant to the primary keyword so why
do we choose a primary and secondary
keyword because you may choose a keyword
as a primary keyword that is relevant to
the content but may not necessarily rank
very high or have a lot of volume that
secondary keyword is also relevant to
the primary keyword but also relevant to
content and you may rank for that
secondary keyword so you always want to
go with two keywords versus just one
keyword you want to give your yourself a
chance to rank for at least two
different types of keywords of relevant
nature so for web page there can be
several secondary keywords but only one
primary keyword so your primary keyword
is always going to be relevant to your
content secondary keywords can be
relevant to the keyword but and you may
have multiple secondary keywords but
it's also going to be related to the
content and it gives you a better
opportunity to be found between both the
primary and secondary in search Okay so
let's take a look at another example of
how to use primary keywords and
secondary keywords when choosing
keywords so our primary keyword is
healthy diet plan remember healthy diet
plan is directly related to the content
so that's what we're talking about but
these secondary keywords are also
related to content and play off the
primary keyword and so what we want to
do is go to C Google's Keyword Planner
tool and get an idea of the volume for
healthy diet plan and then also the
volume and competition for some of these
secondary keywords like healthy diet for
weight loss healthy diet food low carb
diet healthy mail plans and diet plan
weight loss so if I go in to Google's
Keyword Planner and type those keywords
in I'm going to choose get results and
now here I can see healthy diet plan
keyword I'm focusing on as my primary
keyword has an average monthly search
volume of
99,900 and then some of my secondary
keywords healthy diet foods diet plan
weight loss low carb diet you know
Google will give me a number of
different keywords to work with so I'm
going going to look at the search volume
of those as well and so ideally what I
want to do is be able to then look at
the volume and then look at the
competition so healthy diet plan I go
into my keyword analysis here that's my
theme so that's my keyword what's my
volume for healthy diet plan
99,900 what's my competition so my
competition is
74,700 and that's going to give me a
ratio of volume to competition of 133%
so that's what my content's about that's
a considered a short tail keyword
because it has a lot of competition and
so my ratio is 133% and what I want to
do is I want to be able to put these
other secondary keywords in here as well
maybe even go to a little longer tail
because I want to be able to find two
key at least two keywords I want to be
able to find my primary keyword that's
relevant to my content and then I want
to be able to find my secondary keyword
which is again related to the primary
keyword which is also related to the
content and so I want to be able to
choose two keywords basically and I want
to choose two keywords that are relevant
that have good ratio between volume and
competition so that's the whole idea
again of how to do keyword research you
want to be able to find your keywords
use the tools available to you and get a
sense of what the volume is what the
competition is look at the ratio between
the volume and competition and then
based on the content choose that primary
keyword and then again based on the
keyword you chose choose some secondary
keywords as well because you want to be
found for not just one keyword but
multiple keywords okay let's look at
some alternative suggestions to keyword
research so for doing keyword research
we want to take into account LSI
keywords we could take into account
other platforms that host a lot of
content like Kora or Reddit we can use
Google suggestions in the keyword search
bar we can use popular platforms like
Wikipedia and we can use social media
bookmarking like Reddit so there are
lots of suggestions that we can obtain
from various sources so let's start with
LSI keywords and LSI stands for Laten
semantic insect indexing and so
basically what it is it's just keywords
that are linked to your primary keyword
and so when you're choosing keywords you
always want to choose that primary
keyword and then secondary keywords that
are similar to the primary keyword and
usually those are LSI or latent semantic
indexing type keywords so they're used
to drive relevant traffic to your page
so if you're focusing on one keyword we
want to have other keywords that are
similar to increase our visibility on
the search engine result pages so we
could find latent semantic indexing
right in search so if we use the term
healthy diet if we go to Google search
for example if I type in healthy diet in
Google search all I need to do is scroll
to the bottom of the page and I can see
searches related to healthy diet so
healthy diet menu healthy diet essay
what does a healthy diet look like
notice at the top Google's also given me
some other suggestions here so they're
saying lowfat diet veganism gluten-free
diet so there's lots of different
suggestions right in Google search bar
so all of these are LSI related keywords
so if you're optimizing a page for
healthy diet then you could choose
lowfat diet as a secondary keyword you
can use gluten-free diet as a secondary
keyword it really depends on what the
content is but you always want to
support your content with as much LSI
keywords as possible so you can be found
for as many different keywords as
possible in Google search so it's
important because if you have a Blog
that you know talks about python so how
do the search engines know if the
website python is about the programming
language or the snake so Google for
example uses LSI keywords to understand
what the page is specifically focusing
on so if you're just focusing on Python
and your content you want to support
that with LSI keywords and so that will
allow your web page to better
communicate with Google also to have the
visibility to show up on search so they
can certainly improve your search
positioning and featured Snippets as
well so if you have a keyword that
answers a question you can certainly
found for a featured snippet for example
maybe you know healthy diet recipes if I
type that in you could see here there's
a featured snippet so if I'm talking
about recipes that's a keyword I may
want to use and if I use that then
Google has an opportunity to see what my
content's about and place my information
at the top in this featured snippet you
can also again see what some of
questions are being asked what meals are
good for weight loss what is a good
healthy diet plan all of these could be
word phrases that you can use so the
answers are right here in Google so Kora
is a great platform because cor is a
platform that people go and ask
questions in a community responds with
answers or responses to that particular
question or topic and so the great thing
about cor is it's a good it's a good
place for you to go to get some ideas
about a specific topic so if we're
talking about healthy dieting so we can
find keywords with high search volume
writing Kora so the whole idea is you
can look at you know the top five
questions for specific topic like
healthy dieting and find relevant key
wordss to healthy dieting so if you just
type in that particular key word in Kora
you're going to probably get some
responses to questions or responses to
somebody else's question and so if we
take a look at core for example so if I
just type in healthy dieting what I'm
going to do is I'm going to get some
responses to the the topic healthy
dieting so what's the best diet for
Healthy Living what are the top five
tips for a healthy diet habit so all of
these could be keyword phrases that you
could take away with for your own
content and so the benefit here is
you're getting kind of an idea of what's
trending what people are talking about
and if you use tips for a healthy diet
habit for example and you optimize for
that well again that could turn around
and bode well for you because you could
be featured in Google as a feature
snippet at the top here you can also
turn around and use LSI related keywords
for healthy diet habits and you can
simply just look for those LSI keywords
right in Google remember at the bottom
or at the Top If I scroll down I can see
some related LSI keyword at the bottom
so writing Google as well you could see
in the Google search bar that Google
provides some LSI related keywords to
your query so if I go back here and type
in healthy diet recipes I can see here
Google suggesting some other related
keywords healthy diet menu healthy diet
for men healthy diet foods healthy diet
for women so these are all LSI related
keywords that you can use to support
your primary keyword and the content
you're writing about so we've talked
about LSI keywords where to find them so
they're found right here they could be
found at the top of Google and they
could be found at the bottom you can
also then go to core as well and get
some ideas for the types of questions
they're being asked as so if you ask a
question and use that as your keyword
phrase then again you have an
opportunity of showing up for a featured
snip it in Google just by doing some
additional research within Google itself
or on Coral so according to Google the
autocomplete predictions are
automatically generated by Google's
algorithm without any human intervention
it's based on a number of factors but
the primary factor is how often past
users have searched for term so Google
collects all the keyword queries that
somebody types in and they're suggesting
some of the most popular terms that
people have typed in so if I go back to
Google again if I start to type in
recipes I could see some of the other
queries that somebody else has typed in
or some of the most popular queries
related to that topic so if you enter
the keyword healthy diet Google's going
to suggest multiple keyword suggestions
that users have asked in the past and
you could certainly get the search
volume of those keywords just by looking
in Google itself I could see for healthy
diet recipes billions of pages related
to healthy diet recipes I can also get
the search volume by going into Google's
Keyword Planner so if I type in healthy
diet I'm going to be able to see what my
search volume is for that keyword and in
addition I can see the seasonality of
that particular keyword and in addition
to that Google's going to provide some
other related keywords to my search
query so if I'm looking for healthy diet
Google's going to going to suggest hey
maybe you should choose healthy food or
healthy eating or how to lose weight so
those are LSI related keywords that
Google provides in the keyword plan
which is built into the Google ads
platform another option for you is
Wikipedia so Wikipedia is a vast
platform of content so we could turn
Wikipedia into our own assets and use it
to our own Advantage by finding relevant
keywords in an easy fashion so Wikipedia
we can identify a list of keywords in
The Meta description itself we could
choose keywords from the P paragraph of
Wikipedia that has many relevant
keywords or we can take a look at
keywords from the Wikipedia content
section so we can also see additional
Pages like the C also section that gives
relevant keywords that you're looking
for we can also look at the references
section as they contain relevant
keywords so if we go to Wikipedia as an
example and I type in healthy diet and
into Wikipedia here I can get just in
the first paragraph alone I can see some
additional keywords that I might choose
to use like micronutrients I never knew
that micronutrients was related to
healthy diet but Wikipedia is providing
some information about what
micronutrients is and maybe I can use
that as a keyword an LSI related keyword
to my content so if I scroll down I can
the see also section so it might give me
some information food information
information to Consumers for example
dietary guidelines I can look at
categories like dietetics and diets I
can also look at the references section
so I can also see what information was
provided like health effects of
overweight and obesity I can look at
diet and physical activity so all of
these are related to my main keyword
healthy diet so the answers are right in
here in the platform they're just all
over the page so Wikipedia has an
abundance of information you just need
to know where to look so again with
Wikipedia you can look no further than
the first paragraph you can look no
further than the C also section the
referencing section category section
there's lots of information right on the
page itself to help you get ideas for
keywords so if you Google your keyword
with Wikipedia term in the search query
and get relevant keywords from the title
tags and the Ser so you can also do that
as well so if I type in healthy diet
Wikipedia and search I can also get some
information here as well so people also
search for healthy food advantages or
healthy food habits essay or information
about healthy food all of these are
related to my keyword healthy diet so
again another bit of information for you
to choose or look to choose some
additional keywords for it's a Reddit
it's a popular Community where people
post content discuss a variety of topics
so that's what Reddit is so with the
help of subreddit an individual can find
relevant keywords with with high search
volume so in Reddit there's an easy way
to find out keywords they have a keyword
tool called keyword it so keyword it
gives the average monthly searches for a
particular keyword so if we've typed a
word and key rdit and choose keywords
from the autogenerator list this tool
will extract the keywords and give us
those relevant terms to search volume so
if we go to the keyword it and Show an
example of that for example healthy food
I get keywords I can see what keywords
are relevant and the search volume of
that keyword so if I just type in
healthy food keyworded tool is going to
tell me some relevant keywords and what
the volume is so if you don't have the
Keyword Planner tool and Google ads
available to you this is a good
alternative solution to finding keywords
so it's free you just need to go to
keyword it.com type in your keyword
click get keywords and what it's going
to do is give you some relevant keywords
related to your primary keyword with the
search volume let's talk about keyword
clustering now so the whole idea about
keyword clustering is to really take
advantage of the keywords that we're
optimizing for to gain higher ranking so
if we can cluster keywords together in a
theme and that theme of keywords is
relevant to a specific page of a website
then we have a better opportunity to
rank so in other words why do we have to
Target just one keyword when we can
Target many so keep in mind you know LSI
keywords we want to group a bunch of
keywords together that are similar poor
content so for example after some
keyword research you can thematically
group keywords into a core topic so for
example we can cluster these group of
key wordss together like for example
what is SEO how does SEO work int to SEO
what are the basics of SEO all of those
are related to the court theme what is
SEO another cluster of keywords for
example could be SEO techniques SEO best
practices tips and tricks website
optimization on page of techniques Etc
so those are clusters of keywords okay
that we can group together in themes and
if we group keywords together in themes
we can apply that to a particular
content on our website so the whole idea
behind clustering keywords it's going to
provide more diversity more of an
opportunity for us to be found so that's
the whole idea behind clustering so some
additional steps remember stay up to
date on industry news so brainstorm your
ideas first and identify a list of
keywords I.E a theme of keywords that
you can cluster together and then you
could determine the keywords that your
competitors are already ranking for so
for example if we want to rank for the
keyword SEO best practices for example
we can use a tool called keyword MZ if I
go to keyword the keyword Explorer tool
in MZ and just type in SEO best
practices what it's going to do is it's
going to give me some volume related to
that particular keyword but more
importantly what it's also going to do
is going to show me what pages are
already ranked for that particular
keyword so therefore I can get a sense
of who is already ranking for that
keyword so here I can see mzmz
medium.com alexa.com so I can get a send
of what web pages are rank for a
particular keyword or group of keywords
I want to rank for myself greetings
everyone this is Rob Sanders and thank
you for joining me today we're going to
talk about SEO tools let's get started

right relevant keywords I mean that's
really key to SEO is finding keywords
that are relevant to your business
product or service that you want to rank
for so you want to be able to choose
keywords with high search volume and low
competition so where do you get those
numbers you get those from certain tools

certain targeted keywords you want to be
able to generate a list of latent
semantic indexing type keywords keywords
close to the keyword you're trying to
Target you want to be able to select
primary and secondary keywords wisely so
having a list of keywords with certain
data points will help you do that and

tool that you can lean on if so if we
look at Google Trends all you need to do
is trends. goole.com you could type in a
keyword I can look at the volume or
interest of that keyword over time here
I'm looking at football versus American
football and I could see how it's
trending then I could see you know how
it Trends in specific regions of say the
United States as my market I can also
look at other related quer series
similar to football or American football
and so Google Trends is a good tool
helps you look at the volume helps you
look at what specific regions help you
look at other keywords you know if you
want you can simply just do a keyword
search or you can actually just see
what's trending just by looking at the
latest stories and insights so we could
see International women's day you know
started to pick up steam is picking up
more steam Etc so it's certain keywords
that tend to Trend well and you could
pick up on what those keywords are using
Google Trends now you could also use
another Google tool called Google
Keyword Planner the only difference is
this one's paid you need a Google ads
account so if we go into Google ads hey
you'll need to go to tools and you'll
need to to Keyword Planner but when
you're in Keyword Planner you can find
new keywords so if I type in for example
you know online marketing and click get
started what the keyword tool is going
to do is give me the data that I need to
do appropriate keyword research it's
going to give me my keyword and similar
keywords it's going to give me the
average monthly volume and the great
thing here is I can actually see the
trend for that keyword over time just by
clicking on this little bar graph so for
digital marketing I could see what the
trend is over time I can see what the
competition is I could see you know if
I'm going to bid on this keyword I could
see what the bidding range is so more
important I can see the volume and I can
see the competition here's my volume for
this key word over the last 12 months on
average and here's my competition so
Google's Keyword Planner gives you the
necessary information you need to choose
relevant keywords wisely now there are
other tools out there that are paid that
help you look for Relevant keywords like
SCM rush or keyword finder that's a
premium tool so there are plenty of
tools available to you you know another
tool I use that's not listed here is MZ
so if you just type a keyword let's just
type in the same keyword like online
marketing for example okay so what Moz
is going to do is going to give me some
volume it's going to give me some other
keyword suggestions okay it's going to
tell me how difficult that keyword is
and it's going to tell me who else is
ranking for that keyword so it gives me
again all the relative information I
need including competitive information
so you can use these T these keyword
tools Moz is freemium some are paid some
are free there's plenty of tools out
there but these are the ones I would
recommend for keyword research now let's
turn our attention to technical SEO so
for technical SEO you're going to need
to use some tools there's no getting
around that because you want to be able
to monitor how your website's performing
I mean is it loading slow for example
does it have a lot of uh issues with the
website in terms of uh server side
rendering for example or server response
time what about four fours and redirects
so you want to be able to gather a lot
of the technical information that could
Aid or prohibit your site from ranking
so you want to be able to also you know
look at what the Bots are saying and how
they're viewing your website so if
Google goes to crawl your side are they
experiencing you know a slow server
response time or they experiencing Pages
not found you also want to see if you
have a sitemap you know what's the
sitemap are these Bots crawling your
site or getting the pages from a sitemap
again you want to be able to lean on
some of these tools to help you fix
errors that you may encounter like
metatags or fours or canonical so you
need a good tool to help you manage all
that and so I'm going to go back to M
starting out so if we go back to Moz MZ
is a good tool it's an all-in-one it's a
great SEO platform so if I go to MZ and
I log into an account I can just go to
site crawl and so what MZ is going to do
it's going to give me a lot of
information about how mz's bought is
seeing my site okay so if I go to the
site crawl I can look at all the
particular critical uh issues that have
experienced so I can see four forers
okay REITs related to that I can see
metad descriptions missing metad
descriptions duplicate content so
there's a lot of different issues that
Moz is detecting for this particular
site and the great thing about Ms and
this is why I use Moz as my SEO platform
I don't work for Mo I've just used them
a long time is if you do have issues
then they give you ways to fix it the
how to fix it section so if I see me
missing description here if I just click
on review I can get a more indepth
analysis as to what the issues are here
but I can also click on the why and how
to fix okay and they're going to give
you some information about how this is
impacting SEO and what you could do to
fix the issue they lay out the issues
pretty prominently here you can see for
all the metadata issues I have I have
you know 142 total metadata issues I
have 10 title tag to Longs I have 122
missing meta descriptions so they lay it
out nicely here up the top so you can
kind of get a sense of what to work on
and again they prioritize it based on
the severity of the issue and then they
break it down into several categories
for example I just looked at metadata
issues you could see if I click on
content issues I have some duplicate
content that Moz is recognizing or
missing or valid H Texs so M does a
really really great job laying all all
the issues out for you to recognize
there's another tool that I like to use
called screaming frog it's a pay tool so
if we go look here great thing I like
about uh a screaming frog it will crawl
your site and it will give you some list
of issues just like Maz does of you know
what it sees in your site is it
experiencing four fours broken links are
there any redirects it's picking up
duplicate content site Maps you know
their JavaScript issues how does it see
the site architecture so it really does
take a deep look at everything that
could impact your website from ranking
okay there are other tools out there
like you know deep crawl or woo rank
they're both paid and so pay tools are
really great as well it just depends on
you know your pricing structure what
your budget is but really when it comes
to all these tools they all more or less
overlap and do the same thing you just
need to rely on one of them to make sure
that you're able to see what the issues
are now there's nothing wrong with using
two of them just as a second reference
point to see if both are picking up the
same issue and of course I like to use
search console I always like to lean on
Google search console because that is
the source so search console will also
you know give you some feedback on how
Google's bot is crawling your site so
that's under the crawl error section
here so you can also you know use search
console to upload a sitemap so that's a
key to SEO you want Google to be able to
find your Pages quickly so you can
simply just uh signify to Google where
your site map is located so the search
console does a lot more gives you some
HTML improvements gives you some
backlinking uh and then the process of
updating the search console user
interface so there's a new user
interface that you can use with Google
search console the great thing is it's
free and it has everything you need to
know about your website and how it's
affected by SEO organic search the only
thing you have to to do with search
console is verify the site but once you
verify it it has all the relevant
information you need so let's talk about
backlink monitoring and Analysis okay so
this is related to off-page SEO so
you're going to need a good tool to help
your monitor your website backlinks and
backlinks are simply just links from
external sites pointing to your site and
you need to keep an eye on what sites
are linking to yours are they spammy
related sites are they good relevant
sites or anything in between so you need
to really be able to analyze what the
good links are and what the bad links
are pointing to your website you want to
identify and disavow Port pack links
okay so you want to be able to recognize
which sites are linking to yours that's
actually hurting you from an SEO
standpoint and you want to be able to do
something about that okay you want to
measure citation flow and Trust flow you
want to check the ratio of Link
distribution in terms of is it internal
or external or you know what kind of
sites are linking to my site are they
you know social related are they pure
content related and then you want to be
able to track the number of do follow
and no follow links you know how many
links pointing to our site are actually
telling Google and other Bots not to
follow the link or how many are actually
allowing the Bots to follow that link if
a bot follows a link it's going to pass
what we call link juice so you're going
to get credit for the backlink if it's a
no follow you're not going to get credit
for the backlink and we want to be able
to measure that and so we want to have
tools that will help us do that so what
are some of those tools well HRS is a
good tool it's a paint tool Majestic is
a premium tool MZ again Moz is the tool
I use sem rush and then again I got to
mention Google search console so let's
take a look at some of these tools in
terms of backlink monitoring and
Analysis so let's start with Google
search console again it's free you just
have to verify your site and so if I go
to Google Search console I can look at
link links and I could see what external
links I have pointing to my site okay so
I could see I have 177,000 in this
example pointing to the homepage of this
particular site okay so if I click on
that I can see all the the top sites
pointing to my homepage now from an
off-page SEO perspective do you want
every back link or external link
pointing to your homepage no so you want
links pointing to internal pages so you
want to be able to measure that so I
could see with the top linking ites are
and I can also see what the anchor text
is so do I want my anchor text always to
be my brand name no I want it to be you
know keyword we're trying to Target
search console also gives you some
internal links okay one of the top link
Pages for internal links so from an SEO
perspective you always want to have a
nice balance of internal linking so this
report helps you understand what pages
are getting links and are the links
evenly spread so this is Google search
console this is the links report this is
totally free this is provided by Google
all you have to do is verify your site
now if we go over to Moz we type in a
domain any domain so I just typed in
simply and learn okay MZ has some
metrics that are important to off-page
SEO including domain Authority so the
higher your domain Authority the better
off you are and so what helps a domain
Authority grow is how many quality links
are pointing to that domain and so here
we could see over
7,500 linking domains to simply learn so
what's important is we just don't want
any site we want quality relevant sites
pointing okay so we could see how many
total inbound links and then how many
ranking keywords we have okay so here
Moz is going to give me kind of an idea
of what my domain Authority has been
over time they're going to tell me the
top fold links to the site so they're
going to tell me you know what are those
links pointing to my site and what's the
page authority of those sites okay here
I can get a nice graphical breakdown of
the linking domains by domain Authority
so you want pages with high domain
Authority pointing to your site so here
I can see 69 linking domains between 91
and 100 so that's really good we want
High relevant domains linking to our
site so just like search console I can
see the top anchor text being used okay
and I can see the top pages that have
you know good page Authority on the site
I could see following versus no follow
on internal and external links so this
is just the overview so Moz really
really does break down for you you know
what those pages and linking domains are
so if I just click on linking domains
now I could get a detailed look for my
homepage what domains are pointing to
our domain so I can see microsoft.com
has a domain authority of 100 YouTube 99
and so not only does moss provide you
with the domains it also provides you
with their domain auth score and spam
score so you want to keep an eye on any
particular site that has a high spam
score so having a site with a high spam
score and a low domain Authority will
hurt your domain and Page Authority for
that page so MZ does a great job of
breaking it out and this is for any page
it doesn't necessarily have to be the
homepage okay if I take a look at
another example here Majestic so
Majestic again I can use a free version
of the tool they have their own metrics
citation flow trust flow so when they
say trust flow what's the link quality
all about okay citation flow what's the
link volume okay they can get an idea of
how many external backlinks are pointing
to the site and what's the trend on that
referring domains so Majestic does a
really good job again some of the same
metrics that we could see here except
they go into detail about languages as
well so this is majestic and you got
search console you got a lot of other
tools and then I'm going to just revert
back to Mo because you want to be able
to compare link profiles if you're in a
competitive space and you're doing
off-page SEO you know Moz will help you
compare how your site stands against
maybe another competitive site or
relevant site so just doing this
analysis I can compare my domain
Authority spam score how many total
links you know how many external
followed links or external no followed
links got breakdown of linking domains
so it does a nice job of comparing one
site versus another that's going back to
Moz and that's what you want you want a
good tool that's going to help you do
that I mean there's other tools out
there're not listed like bright Edge
that will also help you compare linking
profiles so at the end of the day if
you're doing off-page SEO you want to
get a sense of what sites are linking to
yours are they quality sites are they
spammy what anchor text are they using
are they no follow are they do follow
you know are they top domains how do you
compare against your competitors I mean
all these metrics are related to
off-page SEO so you want a good tool
that's going to help you measure this
okay so let's talk about rank tracking
so when we do keyword research we're
looking for Relevant keywords we find
our relevant keywords we sign primary
and secondary keywords to Pages we
optimize those pages we do off-page SEO
and we do an all this work for SEO okay
we want to be able to measure the fruits
of our labor we want to be able to
measure how we perform for on and off
page SEO for the key keywords we cover
in the pages they're related to and so
that's where rank tracking comes into
play so we want to be able to track our
website's ranking and not just our
website all the pages we've optimized we
want to be able to measure our
clickthrough rates and Impressions we
want to be able to track the ranking for
both desktop and mobile for specific
locations and we want to identify top
performing gaining and losing keywords
so in other words we want to look at
Trends is a keyword ranking is it going
up and rank is it going down in ranking
if it's going down in ranking then you
need to take action so you need a tool a
good tool for rank tracking so we can
look no further than again Google search
console it's free it's right from the
source so let's take a look at what
Google search console has to offer in
terms of rank tracking so if I go to
Google Search console and I put in a URL
what it's going to do is it's going to
give me and this is the search queries
report it's going to give me what
queries people used to actually type
into google.com and it's going to be
able to tell me how many times my pages
show Pages showed up for that query it
could be more than one page so that's an
impression and if I did receive an
impression meaning did my page show up
in the organic listing then did I get a
click as a result and so in this case if
I got 68 Impressions and 10 clicks for
keyword somebody typed in that's a 14.7%
clickr rate and so what search console
will also do is say hey look for that
particular particular keyword you
appeared on average in position 4.1 so
it gives you really good insight as to
you know what people are typing in and
how you're being found for those
keywords it breaks it down by Pages it
breaks it down by country breaks it down
by device so I could see you know mobile
I've had
899 Impressions over the last 3 months
on mobile and I received 33 clicks as a
result my average position on mobile was
2.6 so search console does a really good
job again this is free information of
providing you the actual keyword
somebody's using on Google search as a
query and how many Impressions you're
receiving for that keyword how many
clicks click the rate and then average
position so in theory the higher you are
positioned on Google the more clicks
you're going to receive so if I'm not
positioned properly for keyword let's
say say page two then I'm probably not
going to receive as many clicks as I
would like so that's search console
there are other tools out there like HRS
again does a good job of tracking AMZ
tracker we look at winter so there's
some good tools out there I'm just going
to show you another one again I'm going
to go back to MZ for example so MZ has a
tool called so if I go back into the
account so MOS has a a rankings tool
that you can look at to see where your
keywords are ranking so if you've
already chosen keywords and optimized
Pages for those keywords then you want
to be able to load those keywords in a
Moz and so Moz allows you to do that and
so what Moz does they do a crawl once a
week and they'll be able tell you where
you rank for all your keywords are we
moving up in the rankings are we moving
down how many keywords do we have ranked
between positions one and three 11
through 20 4 through 10 21- 50 so we'll
be able to see where our keywords Rank
and so it gives you a break down here of
nationally in the United States where
this keyword is ranked and if it's moved
up or down and for what URL is it ranked
for and so you can label so the keywords
and and this is what you want to look
for in a good tool you want to be able
to organize your keywords and label them
so for all our branded keywords we want
to be able to label them branded because
ideally you don't want to optimize for
your brand keyword so maybe we want to
exclude our brand keywords and look at
our non-brand keywords in terms of
ranking and so you can certainly add
locations and look at specific locations
the whole idea between find a good
ranking tool is to be able to measure
you know if a keyword is trending up or
down okay so I can simply look at a
particular keyword and I can see the
trend of that keyword and then you know
if a keyword's not ranking then we want
to wonder why it's not ranking well is
it difficult is it not ranking because
of its difficulty or can we do a better
job of optimizing for that keyword and
so Moz also has a page optimization tool
so if you're not ranking for keyword you
can flip over the the page optimization
tool then put in the keyword put in the
URL and mod will give you some idea as
to what you can further do to optimize
the page okay so that's Moz you know
this is HRS so you can see HRS does the
same thing they provide you some
visibility average position how much
traffic you know where you're ranking in
terms of positions 1 through 3 4 through
10 11 through 50 and so you want to be
able to get a sense of where my track
keywords are trending are they trending
up or they trending down and the whole
idea again behind a ranking tools if
you're trending down you want to be able
to address why it's trending now so you
want to start with on page SEO can we do
a better job of optimizing or off page
does that page need more backlink so
that's why you need a backlink tool to
support your ranking and HRS does offer
up some competitor information as well
so you can see how your competitors are
performing so these are some good
examples of ranking tools that you could
take advantage of now there are also a
few important SEO tools that can be
helpful in different ways for example if
you're doing video so there are some
tools to help you measure how you're
performing via video for example vid IQ
so let's take a look at vid IQ so if I
load in say a video in YouTube in this
example how to rank YouTube videos I
have a vid IQ extension loaded into my
browser in Chrome and so now I can get a
good I sense of how many views the
duration the engagement rate the like
ratio how many people shared it on
Reddit but further I can look at how the
video was optimized so they're telling
me the title's too long here maybe
shorten it up but we have tags we have
descriptions we have cards we have end
screens it's been shared on Facebook it
hasn't been shared on Twitter okay it is
public we do have pinned comments and we
do have hearted comments and so this
gives me an idea of how we did in terms
of optimizing this particular video okay
so if we wanted to tweak it we could
tweak the title tag make it a little bit
shorter to help it rank better on
YouTube so you want to be able to use a
tool like this because if you have
videos then you want those videos to
rank and so you can certainly watch this
video on how to rank your YouTube videos
and in that video we do allude to vid IQ
so you want to be able to use a tool
like this because you know YouTube it is
a video portal but it's the second
largest search engine behind Google so
if you do have videos you want to be
able to rank for them and you want a
tool that's going to help you measure
and help you understand if you are
ranking if you're not ranking why are
you not ranking now for Content
optimization there are tools you can use
like sea site checkup or site analyzer
are some good tools if you already have
MZ as an example just going back to MZ
as you already know I use Moz a lot so
they have a page optimization so you
could check the content how you're
optimized your content so it's going to
give me some good feedback on you know
is your page title meta description are
they in line okay so it's going to give
you some good feedback on that you also
have again I have to allude to search
console you can always look at a
particular page and search console see
if it has any errors as well so is it
duplicated meta description is it a
duplicated title tag is it any Pages
missing title tags your Meda
descriptions so when it comes to content
you can look at search console you can
lean on MZ or you can lean on some of
these other paid versions like site
analyzer when it comes to traffic and
metrics look no further than Google
analytics there is a free version of
Google analytics as well as a paid
version so if I go into Google analytics
it's going to tell me all of my website
Behavior okay who's coming to my site
how they got to my site how they behaved
once they went to my site and are they
achieving the goals I set out for them
to achieve via conversions and so you
want to look at first in Google
analytics how much traffic you're
getting so if I go to Google analytics
if I go to acquisition all traffic
channels I should be able to see how
much traffic organic search is driving
over a period of time so I can see how
many users how many sessions then if I
click on landing pages I could see what
landing page they went to so I could see
the homepage over a particular time had
over thousand sessions I can also see
engagement from organic search are they
balancing how many pages are they
looking at in this session after they
landed on a particular page are they
staying on the site a long time what's
their duration or are they achieving any
goals so analytics will provide me all
that information about how organic
search as a channel is performing the
other thing about Google analytics I
like and that goes back to the technical
aspect of SEO and that's sight speed so
if you go to behavior and you go to S
speed overview you'll be able to see how
my pages are loading what's the average
load time so they'll break it down for
you by browser by country and by
specific page so if I look at page
timings I'll be able to see what page is
loading slow what page is loading quick
compared to site average and so the
great thing about analytics is if I have
a page that's loading slow compared to
site average they'll actually provide me
with some suggestions so if I go to site
speed speed suggestions what they're
going to do is they're going to have a
link in the report that's going to allow
me to click on it and I'm going to be
able to see what suggestions they can
provide so when this report loads I'll
be able to see what the speed
suggestions are for my pages so here I
could see the page I could see what the
average load time is of that page so for
example this particular page is loading
at 6 seconds ideally we want to have you
know 3 seconds or under maximum so if I
just click on this link here they're
giving me six page speed suggestions so
if I click on that I'm going to go to
another Google tool called page speed
insights and then page speeed insights
is going to run for both mobile and
desktop for this particular page and
then this page speed insights report is
going to give me feedback as to what I
need to do to speed up the load time of
that page so here you can see for
desktop and mobile they're going to give
me some suggestions and opportunities so
reduce the server response time properly
size images serve images in next CH
formats so all these will shave off time
off my page lad time and so that's
what's going to help me speed up the
page load and that's page speed insights
you can get to from the speed
suggestions report and analytics so in
theory the higher page load time your
chances of ranking on Google organic
search diminish so Google wants pages
that have very low page load time that
load quickly so Google anal is a great
tool for Speed suggestions it's a great
tool for finding out what the traffic is
doing on your site how they're engaging
and are they achieving goals now there
are other tools out there from an
organic perspective like keyword it
that's a good keyword research tool for
Reddit so if you go to keyword it you'll
be able to see from a Reddit perspective
what keywords are driving volume these
are just the results but you can put any
keyword in there and get the results of
that keyword
AO is an important part of the marketing
strategy in case your website doesn't
show up on the first page of the search
engine then you need to work on it to
solve all your SEO related problems
we've come up with a solution welcome to
Simply learns YouTube channel and today
we will be discussing the top 10 tips
that every marketer needs to know so
let's get started and see the first step
the first step is voice search now voice
search will impact search queries in
2021 according to dialog tech.com
in the United States of America 55% of
the households will have their own smart
speaker by
2022 well that's a lot so if you're
planning to optimize your voice search
consider choosing wise
keywords find out longer phrases that
searchers Us in daily life
conversation voice search is a more
suitable way for searching long and more
natural sounding phrases creating
detailed and relevant answers are
essential when optimizing for voice
search so always remember to create
Persona based content next create web
pages that can answer FAQ use because
when Searchers ask a question they begin
their question with words like who when
what however there are many reasons for
using voice search such as dictating

business profile so are you ready let's
first talk about what is Google business
profile it used to be called Google my
business Google has renamed Google my
business to Google business profile to
make it more simple yeah to bring more
of the business profile management
functions out of the Google my business
app directly into Google search and the
Google
Map yep so now the history of the name
it's you currently called Google
business profile you may remember Google
my business before that it was Google
places before that it was Google Plus
local remember those gole days and when
it officially started it was just Google
local but to keep things simple it has
now been renamed as Google business
profile that you can access through the
Google search or through Google Maps so
how would you define it Google business
profile is a tool that enables you to
manage and optimize your business
profile on Google yeah so you can create
a free business profile on Google for
your shop or your service area so you
can turn people who find you on Google
Search and on Google Maps into new
customers and once you've created your
Google business profile you can then
personalize it with photos with offers

profile is Google term for your Google
Business listing yeah they appear in
Google maps and in the local results of
Google search and that's very important
you can access it through Google Maps
and Google search in the local search
results and you can also see it on the
right side of the search engine results
page so let me show you an example if I
open up a new frame and I search for
Indian
restaurant yep then here you see the
search results yep you
see restaurants and here you see a map
where you can find those places yeah so
that is in the first place where your
restaurant will show up yes so if I go
then click on one of the restaurants I
can get more details of different
restaurants but also more details about
the restaurant that I
picked yeah and this is what you specify
in Google my business profile so I could
also access them through the map yeah so
if I click on that that opens up the
same window which more details about the
restaurant as specified in Google
business profile now what is all in
there I'll share that with you in a
minute so that is the power of Google
business
profile so how can you use this for your
local marketing why is it good to use it
to set up your business
profile Google has reported that 46% of
all searches done on Google have a local
intent and that business location is the
main P of information sought by local
Searchers yeah so it's the easiest way
and the fastest way for you to show up
in the search feed so Google business
profile gives you the ability to
incorporate your search engine results
into your marketing and that is a huge
Advantage for local businesses it's not
just an ordinary business listing but
it's a robust tool that gives you
benefits from appearing in the Google
search results so if I would summarize
the benefits of Google business profile
they are as follows they will give you
customer engagement they will help you
highlighting your business in Google you
can gain insights from the people that
visit your website and you can optimize
your online presence for local
SEO so let's dive into these a little
bit deeper let's start with the customer
engagement so through Google business
profile customers and Prospects can
contact you and in your business profile
you can specify your telephone number
your address and directions to your
business so people can contact you they
can find you and they can engage with
you say for example a potential lead
comes across your business in the search
results but he wants something special
so how will he reach out to you directly
from the search list Google business
profile has a messaging feature that
lets you directly chat with potential
customers who will find your profile on
the search results page it enables you
to quickly answer questions in real time
and help your current and potential
customers Google gives you the option to
activate this yes so when you activate
it users visiting your page will see a
clickable message icon on top of that
they can call you or you can add posts
to your business profile to promote
special offers or events and updates to
keep your customers in the loop you can
also reply to public customer reviews to
build trust with new returning customers
and of course you can post answers to
frequently ask questions by your
customers the second Advantage is that
Google business profile offers you the
opportunity to highlight your business
yes so it gives you a ton of
opportunities to specify a lot of things
about your business when you sign up and
sign in you get to your dashboard and
that's where you can add items like
showcasing what makes your store special
show photos of your latest products and
your store to stand out to customers who
find your profile yeah you show whether
you offer options like a pickup or a
delivery you can give people who find
you online a warm welcome with posts
about discounts new products upcoming
events so lots of things that you can
highlight about your business again let
me show you an example if I go to Google
and I search for instance for Disney
Paris
yeah you will see I find or let's say
Disneyland
Paris yeah so when I click here on
Disneyland Paris then here I get all the
details I can see the description I can
see the address the rights that you can
do the hours of opening you can see who
is owned by you see events that they
have
there's questions and answers there's
reviews yep and there's more information
there's links to social media so lots of
stuff that you can find here as long as
you specify at all on your dashboard
when you highlight your
business so the third benefit is that
you can gain a lot of insights with
people or from people that visit your um
and that find you on Google yeah so you
can gain data about your target market
and your local search
performance you can track your
performance over a given time period and
it will give you insights how people
interact with your business on Google
you can check how often your profile has
been viewed you can use profile views
insight to track how popular your
business is with current and potential
customers yeah now OB obviously only the
owner um of the business profile can
view the profile insights you will get
metrics like the queries people used to
find your business the number of unique
visitors to your profile number of
unique customers who request directions
to your business the number of clicks on
the call to action button on your
business profile number of clicks on the
website link number of unique
conversations through messages
yeah number of completed bookings by
customers a summary of all your
interactions number of views on products
over a selected period And if you are a
restaurant you can get food orders
placed for pickup or delivery and you
get a number of clicks on the menu
content per user per day so you gain a
lot of knowledge about who what and when
people are accessing and finding you on
on Google and finally one of the biggest
advantages that you can get with Google
business profile is that it improves
your local search rankings leading to a
higher visibility of your business on
the web so when you search for a product
or service on Google the first three
listings are usually Google
ads yeah followed by a map with local
three pack as we call this and then you
will see the organic search results so
let's show you an example of this local
three pack on Google if I go to search
and I search for Sho shop near
me yeah I'm getting ads yeah that's the
first part and then I'm getting three
places and here is your Google three
pack your local three pack with the map
and then I have the organic search
results yes so one of the biggest
benefit then I get the search results so
for local businesses prior to this local
pack yeah there were two main ways to
show up on the first page of Google
through local paperclick and through
local
SEO now with the addition of this Google
local pack you now have three potential
ways that you could show up on the first
page of Google for Relevant local
searches and that's something that
cannot be ignored now what is this local
three pack it consists of the top three
local businesses based on the Searcher
location yeah the best part of it is
that customers now end up at your shops
Front without even having to visit your
website
so remember this used to be a seven pack
and it's now limited to only three local
listings hence the title The Local thre
pack now many many businesses have been
trying different SEO tricks to get into
this special category of three listings
yeah but what most of them don't know is
that by creating a Google business
profile listing you can significantly
increase the chances of making it onto
this list now there's more that you can
do to make it in this threek it's
important to get reviews on your Google
my business profile yeah so that helps
you increase the chances of showing up
in this local pack and it's also good
for your reputation which is very
important for your business and Google
will reward you for that with giving you
higher search rankings and additionally
all the SEO rules and guidelines that
apply to standard search engine
optimization they apply to your local
listing as well so think about your
keywords your website SEO getting
backlinks these will all contribute to
your local search listing and whether or
not you will appear in the threek now
also consider that paid advertising can
help you in getting your business listed
here yeah through local search ads on
Google there is an opportunity for your
business to serve a local payperclick ad
in the three
peg yep and remember just a few tips in
order to show up in the Google three
pack with your payperclick ads there's a
few steps that you need to take yeah
enable local extensions or location
extensions as we call them in Google ads
bid the location and use Lo sorry bid by
location and use location targeting and
optimize your keywords to include your
location as well so having your business
appear in the local three pack can help
you tap into potential Revenue
opportunities as Google not only shows
customers your business on Google Maps
but it also places it before organic
search results and let's look at the
final topic before we go into a demo of
Google business profile let's look at a
bit more detail about how Google
business profile can help you with your
SEO and what you need to do to optimize
it for
SEO there are three aspects in using
Google business profile for SEO you need
to Target your information by including
your SEO keywords relevant to your
business you need to make sure you
maintain information quality by ensuring
all information is accurate consistent
and correct and you need to build trust
by engaging with your
customers so to achieve this here is
what you need to do you need to verify
your business you need to fill out your
profile
completely you you need to make sure
your profile information is and stays
accurate you must ensure that your
nap name address place is consistent
across the web which is very important
yeah your address is unique across all
your places where you are on the web you
pick the most relevant categories for
your
business make sure that your pictures
your photos are of the highest quality f
focus on getting
reviews create posts on your business
profile to drive engagement with your
customers and when customers ask
questions on your business profile make
sure you answer those
questions yeah here you see the
importance when you fill in all the data
of the various Fields you see the most
important yeah there is name address
phone number website link but don't for
get the all the other items as well so
for determining your local ranking
Google takes three factors into
consideration there's the relevance of
your listing is how well your business
matches the user search intent and to
increase the chances that your local
business appears in the search results
you should feed Google with as much
information as
possible Google will also look at the
distance yeah so the distance refers to
how close your business location is to
the location of the user who
searches and finally prominence yeah
Google determines your local ranking by
checking out how well known your
business is and whether or not you have
a good

is it a service business let's say it is
a local store customers can visit the
business in person click on that and it

LT so spine Road E which is the
watermarks spine Road East I don't mind

will be be able to find this on the
internet yes so I'm going to click
next what contact details do I want to
show my customers I want to show them
the phone number and that could be
07545 and then
328
999 is United Kingdom and I can also say
I'm going to skip this step actually for
now I'm going to skip skip this
step put your business on the map yes
start connecting with your customers
across Google all in one place so here
are the details that you've learned
earlier in today's presentation get
discovered respond to review manage your
business details yep and now I'm going
to click uh do I want get tips and
alerts I'm not interested in that I just
click
continue and here I am in my
dashboard now here comes the process of
verification which is an important
element of Google business profile yeah
so we talked a bit about businesses
using it for spam purposes yeah so the
verification is very important for
Google there are various ways that you
can get verification Google has made it
fairly simple you can verify through a u
through a phone number you can also
verify by getting a card sent to your
physical business address your listing
will not show on Google until you have
verified your
business okay but for now I'm going to
click next and I'm going to actually I'm
going to click verify later because I
don't want to do the verification
yet so now I can add business hours I'm
going to skip that yeah remember we
talked about messaging I'm going to skip
the messaging and now I can add photos
of my business so let's grab a photo
from the internet yep so let's say Isis
Lake South
Cy and I'm going to go to
images so here is the park where you see
images so I am going
to uh take any random image let's say
we'll
take this
image yep I'm going to rightclick I'm
going to click save image as and I'm
going to do Isis Lodge
o1 all right so I'm going to complete my
profile I'm going to add a photo I'm
going to select photo from the computer
I'm going to YouTube and then desktop
and here is the Isis
Lodge yep there's the photo and I can
obviously add a lot more photos there's
the next do I want to start advertising
on Google ads I can actually claim a
400 free advertising credit of course
that is really good what they do here
just to get you to start using
advertising and then get a customer
domain name for a website I haven't got
a website yet but I'm not interested in
that at the
moment yeah so remember your edits will
be visible once you're verified I so my
listing will not be visible yet but here
is basically my bising list business
listing as it stands at the moment but
it is not publicly visible but at least
I have set up my business profile yeah
so now I'm in my dashboards
in
Google um my business I had to go into a
separate app for this but now I can
actually edit it all through the search
so that is very useful so here is edit
profile read reviews read a messages uh
add photos what is the performance do we
want to go advertising all the things we
discussed in our earlier session so edit
profile and here I can get information
about contact information location
information hours of opening my business
name of my Lodge the opening date
contact
information yes so location I can
specify here so all the details that I
need and if I do this properly is where
it will show up in Google and if I
really got my reputation sorted and
everything I may show up in the Google
three pack as well so that is the
process of setting up your Google
business profile so let's now look at an
existing business profile let's switch
my account so I'm going
to sign out of this account and I'm
going to sign in again into my own
account
so now I'm in my own Google account and
I'm going to I'm switching to Chrome I
say no just leave it as it is okay well
we can do that yeah so now I'm in my
Google Chrome my my personal account and
I'm going to show you an
existing um Google business profile that
I have which is for a webs for another
house in Marakesh which is Riyad
Faria yeah so you see here it is already
on Google my business or sorry it's
already on Google business profile but I
haven't really populated it yet with
information okay so here you can see I
can access this through the Google
search to manage my profile yep so I can
edit a profile I can read to reviews all
the things that I want to do I can add
an update I can see the photo
yep so here I have access to it and then
here you see the side panel with a
summary of all the things that you've
done okay I could also access this
through Google Maps again if I go to
Google
Maps and I search in Google maps for
riat for
Russia yeah here here it is RI Russia d
it will take me here's the basic details
in Google Maps yeah and it will take me
here to Riad for Russia but it is empty
I haven't added any information in it
yet so I can now click here on manage my
business profile or I can see where um
the uh all the details that I have added
so far I get some basic data so 55
people feuded it this month and without
actually having done any effort in
optimizing it or populating it with
information so if I here click on manage
your business profile that takes me back
to the Google search screen where I can
add all the data so let's add a photo I
can click here for add a photo or I can
click here to add a photo I'm clicking
here add a photo I'm doing a photo click
here and then select photo or video and
that is from the
YouTube desktop it's here faria1 is the
photo that I'm going to
add yep so now I can see the
photo let's see if I can do here you see
the
photo got it yeah and of course I can
add a lot more I can do a logo a cover a
video photo of the Interior here's a
photo that I've done so far so I can now
go back to my business
profile yeah I think it will take a bit
of time before the photo shows up on the
uh on the
profile yeah so click add
photo yes so the photos don't show up
yet yeah but that's how you can optimize
your profile making sure all the
information is relevant yep so that is
basically all there is to managing your
profile on uh on Google business profile
so remember you can access it directly
by searching for your business name in
Google search or you can exit it addit
um access it directly by entering for
searching for your business name on
Google Maps
both show the the results and then they
also give you access to your dashboard
where you can add all the information
that needs to be
added yeah performance we talked about
that as well yeah so here you can check
by month you can see I've uh I started
the um the created the the business
profile sort of the beginning of October
so here you can see I can check from OCT
October
[Music]
to December
apply so I see I had 18 business profile
interactions I can check people that
called me people that messag me with the
directions people that look at website
clicks booking clicks so you can get a
lot of
information of people that visited your
business
profile okay okay so that concludes the
demo of the uh Google business profile
and now let's go back to the slides to
give you a summary of the Google
business profile and the positives and
the negatives of
it okay hope you found that useful so
let's finish today's presentation with a
few more facts about the pros and the
cons of your Google business profile we
talked about all the pros all the
benefits that you can get yeah and to
summarize Google business profile can
help you with reaching your
customers it can help you responding to
customer interests it can help you get
respond to customer feedbacks Y and you
can get into engagement with your
customers and most important of all it
can help you in a very easy way to get a
presence on Google search results page
without actually having a
website yeah so it is a extremely
powerful tool and it's a free tool for
your business to get yourself an online
presence where your customers can find
you and where they can engage with you
but there are some cons as well yeah I
have to think hard about cons but as
most things in digital marketing one con
you could say yeah it takes time yeah of
course you need to set up your business
profile yeah and it takes time to do
that it takes time to maintain this but
I don't see this a considerable serious
drawback because people that are
prepared to put the time and effort into
it they will be rewarded
accordingly one potential negative of
Google business pro profile can be that
fake businesses can use it as well
because it's a free service yeah and
although you do there is a verification
process in the Google uh business
profile yeah there may be businesses who
take advantage of this um of this free
service yeah so anyone can realistically
set up a profile to promote their
business so there was an example a few
years ago that fake locksmiths were
committing fraud through local listings
on Google business profile with bogus
profiles so while the majority of the
profiles are genuine businesses trying
to promote themselves in a very
competitive World there are some to see
this as a feature and an opportunity for
scams yeah so people believe that
reviews photos and verifying a business
by mail would be enough to deter
scammers however in this age of fake
news as well as misleading e-commerce
reviews Google must take action to
constantly optimize their verification
process of Google business
profile welcome to today's session I am
Sachin seel and I'm here to talk about a
very important tool Google ads what is
Google ads Google ads is a online
platform or an interface or a tool we
can say or a software which is developed
by Google to help the advertisers to run
different kind of ads on different
publishing sites or publishing platforms
if I make it more simple for you suppose
you are an Advertiser and you sell a
digital marketing codes so you know that
the bulk of the traffic would come from
Google because this is the most used
search engine in the world so when we
type this we see lot of results here and
when we start a website it is very
difficult to rank organically or free or
through the SEO on the very first few
pages with the help of Google ads in a
very starting days we can rank on the
top like this this this or this
Advertiser so these are the four top
positions which right now has been given
to the advertisers who are playing or
who are running their ad using Google
ads on a first page we see seven of such
ads four on the top I've shown you and
three on the
bottom so these are the maximum
placements which we see on a Google
search page this is the first kind of AD
which can be created under the Google
ads tool which we would definitely going
to learn today how to create such
beautiful ad copy second ad which
generally we see on different sites like
if I'll open any new site if I'll open
any blog site if I'll open a site like a
speed
test.net then you would see a beautiful
banner or a responsive uh ad like these
these and these okay how come I'm able
to say that these are ads so if you'll
just hover on this this would say ads by
Google ads by Google so a different
Advertiser this is a Paramount this is
from goad and the publishing site which
has been selected by these advertisers
is speed
test.net the Third Kind of AD which we
generally see on Google itself but in a
different colors and shape is called
shopping ad so if I just search suppose
I want black
formal
shoes
then the add copy is changed it is not
like a text ad which we have seen
earlier though there is no text ad in
this search but we have just seen in the
case of digital marketing course but it
is an ad we can see from here
okay so this is called a shopping
ad then if I go and if I'll
open
YouTube and if I'll search a term maybe
I'm in a search of
email for beginner
course and if I just play any of the
videos a random one
and before the video
plays certainly we can skip after 5 to 6
seconds and sometimes we see a ad with
streams but cannot be skipped so these
are video ads which again created by
this beautiful tool Google ads one more
ad Mobile Installation but I cannot show
you as I'm from the desktop though I
would able to show you the screenshot of
the same now coming to the part why
Google ad is so important okay so I'll
be just quick now because we have to be
making the account today and also the
campaign Google ad is important in many
ways because Google ad helps us to
increase the visibility of our products
increase the visibility of our brand
because you can just imagine you were
there on Google but you were somewhere
on Sixth page or probably you know in
the next page ination if I'll just go
and uh not be on that there are results
but suppose you are you were on the
sixth page so we can just assume that
nobody goes beyond first or second I
don't know if you go or not but I don't
go okay and that's how the survey says
97% of people doesn't go beyond first to
second page so that means we have to be
on a first page if we really want to
sell our products so increasing that
visibility of our brand would take time
if we just keep waiting for Su results
to come or to give us the first page or
a second page ranking so for that reason
for a quick results by making a relevant
ad copy and by targeting the right
keywords we can increase the visibility
we can increase the brand awareness we
can increase the traffic
okay we can also use a beautiful way of
retargeting or a remarketing where
people are able to recall our brand or
able to make the decisions if at a first
time they were not actually taken
suppose I say they went to my site or
any of the sites but in a very first
time they have not given me a result so
for me as this website the result is
getting the lead form filled this is a
lead form and this is the page where we
have reached and where wherever you know
you would see a relevant page connected
to the particular ad that page is called
a landing page okay so this landing page
has a Content this landing page has a
objective to get the form filled and
this landing page has a CTA which is
called a call to action okay so for me
as an Advertiser or as a digital
marketer or as a campaign manager of
this brand dig perform it's very
important to get as many as people to
this page plus it is the most important
part that I get lot of form filled and
lot of CPA clicks or this call to action
clicks but every time I cannot assume I
have to be realistic as well if even 100
or thousand users have landed to my
website from the ad I I cannot expect
more than 3 to 5% conversions okay so if
I say suppose 100 users have reached my
page today since morning so I can only
expect 3 to 5% of leads or 3 to five
users would have filled the data but
when we talk about a remarketing then it
is about retargeting those guys who have
reached here but did not filled up the
data or did not convert it or in the
same case if I have taken them to the
black formal shoes site they reached to
the uh landing page or product page but
did not bought the product so for that
reason we can always retarget them using
the website data so all these things are
very important once we start learning
Google ads deeply then you would know
how these works like you know how the uh
functionality of of these works like
okay so they are talking about the same
thing rlsa is retargeting list of search
ads we are able to Target people who uh
have not converted okay who have not
converted okay then it is also used for
um I think I talked about branding now
they're talking about how the strategies
work like so we generally work on the
different bid uh strategies like how you
pay to Google so the most important one
when it comes to Google search ad this
is called search ad or text ad is CPC so
CPC is cost per click okay now I'm
talking about a very important technical
term the very first technical term
probably we have just talked uh about
the broadness of of the Google ads how
that is you know important to increase
The Branding visibility and traffic we
did talked about the remarketing a bit
but now I'm getting into the uh campaign
terms which is going to be very
important if you want to learn today how
to create a search campaign or search
child so the very first thing is bidding
strategy so we pay CPC or it is also
called PPC when we running this sort of
an ad which is called text ad this means
cost per click or pay per click so when
somebody clicks on this clicks on this
clicks on this as a user as a Searcher
as a viewer then only a Advertiser would
pay to Google this is what PPC means pay
per click marketing so Advertiser is
getting an advantage that till the time
the ad is only been shown he is not
paying any Penny to Google but the
moment a very first user comes and
clicks on it then the amount of certain
bid value starts deducting from the
advertisers Google ads account which we
certainly going to be creating for you
guys as well in a while
okay so you create a Google ads account
you put some money into it you start
running the ad of different sort text ad
Banner ad video ad shopping ad and the
moment somebody clicks or somebody
watches a video or somebody takes any
action on your ads then only you pay
most of the times okay that is what the
CPC strategy works like then also it is
a very important part that we should
know how we are measuring the result
so in anywhere in the digital marketing
if you talk from my experience I know we
are only able to get better results or
we are only able to get more conversions
if we are just not earning the ad we
have to be first researching how the ads
should be created we have to be working
on the areas which should not be filled
uh we should not be left unfilled and it
should be focused on the audience it
should be f focused on certain uh
parameters and after running the ad also
it is very important to keep measuring
the performance and optimizing
optimizing and optimizing further or
otherwise taking care in the next
campaign okay so I think superficially
we have talked about a lot of things uh
on a go why not just to get into the
Google ads now see how the account is
created for free and then let's make a c
campaign first and we'll come back and
we understand we'll try to understand
some of the important things like you
know there are metrics which we have to
be seeing there are formats okay so
formats I've already talked about okay
so this is the text that I've already
shown then there is a banner ad which
I've shown you on the uh you know speed
test.net there is another kind of an ad
image that again you know you see on a
different platforms like websites and
apps then there is a app ad which I
could not show you practically because I
am logged in from my desk stop so this
was the fifth kind of an ad which I was
talking about a Mobile Installation ad
so this probably you see only on most of
the time on a mobile because as an
Advertiser he would want that
installation Button as a CTA should be
directly placed under the ad so that if
person searches for something on a
mobile then the ad is directly showing
them the installation button and the app
can be downloaded into their mobile
gadgets okay so now then there is a
video ad which we already seen and a
shopping ad I've already shown you okay
then there's another ad which is just a
call only though it is again you know
created by the Google ads only we will
see now coming to create the Google ads
okay so first of all creating the
campaign we need to be having a Google
ads account that's a very first
requirement so I'll just help you now
how you create a Google ad ads account
for free by using your Gmail ID okay so
we go to
Google let me just search for here
itself and we type Google ads just
ensure that you are logged in with any
of your Gmail
ID and then we see Google
ads on the top then we just need to
click
this and once once you reach to this
page you have to click get
started after get started probably in my
case you would see a different screen
because I have lot of accounts created
lot of clients accounts are there but in
your case it will show new Google ads
account like this so I will repeat my
steps so that you're not
confused so you go on
Google you type Google ads
you click Google ads the very first
result or either if it is not showing in
your country in your location then you
have to just find ads.
google.com and you click get started
okay the moment you click get
started you would directly reach to this
page okay that's why I just repeated my
steps because I've been taken to some
other page where my already created
accounts were showing but in your case
after just clicking get started it will
directly going to take you to this page
now here you have to ensure that you are
not clicking anything why because this
has brought us to the express mode
Express mode is more of the kind like
automated or a smart mode which is
created by Google for uh making the
quick ads you know it is not going to be
showing you all the exhaustive settings
or um you know advanced settings inside
so so for that reason what we do we go
down we just you know I've just I've
just scroll down okay and then switch to
expert
mode okay I'll again repeat when we
click this get started we reach to this
page where it takes us to the smart or
Express mode where we don't have to be
doing anything we scroll down and we
click on a switch to export
mode once we click that then you would
see few things which you have just seen
in the PPD probably that what is your
objective why you have come here you
have come here to increase your sales
leads website traffic and XYZ things but
because right now I'm just teaching you
or just letting you know how the account
is created then we can ignore these tabs
for a moment of course in a while we'll
talk about these as well so we'll just
scroll down and we'll create account
without a campaign as I said we are
going in a sequence so we are not
creating the campaign first I'm
considering most of the users would not
have the Google ad account as of now so
I am going that way so you create the
account first without a campaign so when
you click this then you see there are
few basic questions been asked like from
which country your billing would be
which time zone you want to follow or
which currency you would be paying in
okay once this is done just click
submit okay just click submit
once this is done congrats you're all
done okay then you just need to click on
explore your
account and this takes you to the
dashboard of this beautiful tool Google
ads from where we can start our journey
of making the very first
campaign okay so now let's again come
back to the PPD because our account is
created now before making the campaign
what all things should be cleared let's
discuss okay so you can create all these
kind of campaigns or with all these
goals inside the Google ads which we
have just learned how to be uh creating
the account okay how the account is
created we can create the campaign to
increase the sales we can in we can
increase the leads by running the ads we
can increase a website traffic we can
work for the product branding or a
consideration we can also work for brand
awareness and app promotion okay these
are the sub defined goals or predefined
goals before we jump into the campaign
making of a search or a display or a
video okay I I hope these all these all
are very much defined or self-defined
ones so I don't have to be you know
telling you what is sales and what is
branding and what is awareness but still
if you feel so in a in a while I will
just going to throw some light on it
okay then setting up the ad group so
I'll be just making all this practically
with you so we don't again you know have
to be understanding all this now coming
to some of the metrics which you would
see inside the campaign once that is
created so let's just go back and see
one of the ads from any of my clients so
that we can learn better
I'll just open in a different
tab okay so if I just have to show
you probably I can just use right now
the demo cont of a simply learn where
important metrics
we can discuss which which has already
been given in the PPT but of course I
will just show you how they look like
inside the campaigns or inside the
Google ads account so if we move to the
dashboard when we have created and if we
have already been running any campaigns
and we want to see results or any of the
metrics then what we do we go into all
campaigns and from here we can see all
sort of campaigns created in the past
okay because I want to see only the
results from the search campaigns
because there are all kind of campaigns
being created here like video campaigns
and display and all so what I can do I
can click this this Lo U uh navigation
menu on the top left and then I can just
select the search
campaigns once this is
selected only these search campaigns
would be visible
now if I just go on any of the campaign
suppose
inside then this breadcrumbs changes
earlier I was only in the all campaigns
then I just selected search campaigns
and now inside the search campaigns I
have selected a specific campaign okay
so considering suppose this was the
campaign I have run in the January for
any of my digital marketing sales okay
or any of my product sales or any of my
services reg generation XYZ objectives
could have been okay now coming to the
main
part from the metrics point of view so
we see here that there
are results being shown of course
because this is a demo account so you
don't see numbers we can always change
the dates like suppose I want to see the
uh result of last 30 days so I would
just go here and this would show these
many Impressions have come Impressions
like how many times the ad is just been
seen okay impression means just how many
times the ad been seen okay then it
would show how many times the ad
actually been clicked okay how many
times the ad been clicked assuming 100
times The Impressions have come and two
clicks have come so the percentage which
is basically a ratio of a clicks to
impression is called CTR The Click
through rate which is the next one
clicks impression and CTR okay so click
through rate is the ratio of impression
to clicks your ad been shown 100 of
times or 100 times probably but only
click today for three times so your CTR
is 3% your ad been
shown 100 times but been clicked seven
times so your CTR is 7% which is a very
good number okay anything around 5 to 10
is good okay we don't get to see lot of
uh Clicks in our initial days because
people do trust the brands which are
already established but slowly gradually
with the right branding with the right
awareness our click rate increases our
CTR increases okay then comes your
average CPC which certainly you would
see here as well so average CPC is a
price which you actually end up in
paying for every click okay so there is
a bid value bid value means when you
started to create your account or with a
campaign of a search then you decide for
certain keywords that how much money you
would pay for every click okay that is
called a bid price which we certainly
see here okay and once you start getting
the clicks after running your campaign
then the exact pricing being shown as a
average CPC price okay then comes the
cost cost is basically going to be your
multiplication of number of clicks
you've got with the average CPC you have
paid suppose you have got 100 clicks
today and for every click you paid 5
rupees so 100 into 5 going to be 500 or
if you uh understand by the dollars so
suppose for every click you have paid
one USD so for 100 clicks you will pay
100 USD by the end of a day okay that is
going to be your day cost or a average
cost you have paid for particular ad on
a particular day that is also understood
by saying daily budget you have spent
okay so if I have alloted that I would
pay 900 rupees a day and 9 900 rupees a
day in the average of the CPC if I would
have probably 10 Rupees so I will get 90
clicks okay because 90 clicks into 10
Rupees for a click going to exhaust my
900 per day budget if this would have
been $100
then 100 clicks multiplied by $1 will
going to exhaust my $100 per day okay
this is how Google calculates like for
how much uh budget you want to run the
ad for and on various factors your
average cost per trick is decided okay
this is the uh understanding of all
these terms cost per conversion and
conversion depends that how
your next step actually being designed
so by Next Step I mean suppose if I talk
about this particular ad only a person
clicks and person reaches here okay so
we can Define the conversions like
suppose 100 people have reached here on
the landing page this means 100 clicks
would have happened okay so the
dashboard would
say 1,000 Impressions 100 clicks one 1
rupee 100 rupee okay one rupee being the
aage CPC 100 clicks we have received and
we have spent 100 rupees but it doesn't
mean that all those 100 clicks which
actually took the users to the landing
page would have been converted okay so
when the conversion code is been placed
on the confirmation page which opens
after the conversion happens or after
the goal completes so that actually
tells us how many people got converted
or how many people actually uh fulfilled
or completed our objective of goal
whatever it was regeneration sales uh
download brocher any of the
subscriptions any of the CTS you talk
about okay so uh talking about the
numbers suppose only three people or two
people or two users have filled this
data okay so the numbers in my dashboard
would be like 1,000 Impressions have
been shown 100 clicks have come means
100 people have reached to the landing
page but only two conversions have
happened okay and the cost for all the
clicks would be like 100 rupees because
average CPC was 1 rupee okay so when the
conversion is two then we can say that
our conversion rate was 2% why because
out of 100 clicks I was only able to get
two people across the confirmation page
or across that CTA which was a call to
action of buy now shop now or sign up or
download whatever it was that is called
a conversion and conversion rate 2% cost
per conversion can only also be divided
like two conversions I've got in 100
rupees so my cost per conversion would
be 50 rupees okay my average CPC is one
my clicks been 100 my Impressions been
th000 my CTA been 10% how 100 divided by
1,000 CT are 10% a a cc 1 cost becomes
100 rupes my conversions been two that's
why conversion rate is 2% and my cost
per conversion comes like 50 why because
I've got two conversions on the spent of
100 that brings 50 rupees here I hope
this is clear if I have
to just
demonstrate just wait so that this is
basically you know uh being captured in
your heads with more clarity so I'm just
going to
use a normal
example
Impressions the same numbers which I've
just
explained so that you
know okay so this is cost per conversion
suppose your ad received th000
impressions today 100 clicks have come
so your CTR becomes 10% because that is
how this is calculated clicks by
Impressions where I CPC was 1
rupee or it has bilon dollars so your
cost would be 100
rupees or
$100 you've got two conversions means
two people or two users have uh bought
anything or have subscribed or have just
you know completed that call to action
and the conversion rate for that would
be 2 divided 100 so
2% and cost per conversion in this case
would be 50 rupees because you have paid
100 rupes for two conversions and in
this case it would be
$50 just a hypothetical number do not be
very much worried about the numbers okay
with the high priced okay this would
change certainly when we do the research
of our keywords
okay now coming to the part how now
these ads been created that's the most
important part how we create a beautiful
ad copies and all that okay so we go
into the campaign making by all
campaign and then we click on a
campaign we click on a new campaign
Google ads most of the time works slow
nowadays so you have to be a bit patient
with this and then we click on a create
campaign without a goal guidance or we
can always click website traffic lead
sales okay these all four can be created
uh for the Google ad search campaign you
know we can only use these four for the
search ad because if I just click this
this will not allow me to create search
ad this only allows video ad if I'll
click this this only allows display and
video ad this only allows mobile ad and
this is for the local so if I have to
create a search ad like this or a text
ad like this so I have to be either
creating through sales leads or website
or either without a guidance so I'll
just going to be teaching you all the
settings inside so that you know the
Google ads uh you know search ad
settings in advanced level so I'm just
taking without a gole then you click
search
ads our focus is just to create search
ad you can leave this part right now
because your conversions are not being
created we'll do in maybe in a next
session when we'll talk about the
advanced settings and website visit is
my Premier goal and suppose I'm running
the ad for any of these sites probably
I'm running the ad
for let me just see if I can get the
simply learn landing page so this Mark
search
marketing just a minute guys
digal
marketing
course click on
continue and then the very first thing
you see bidding which we have just
learned that we pay on a cost per click
basis so
clicks and you can always set up your
bid limit that I do not want to pay more
than suppose one rupee a click or two
rupe a click or 5 rupe a click okay and
there is another thing which we have to
be discussing before we talk about the
bid limit so let me just take you to
the Keyword Planner so this comes from
here tool settings Keyword Planner so
that we get an overview that how much
actually we should be paying for every
keyword we are running the ad for
suppose my keyword for which I want to
run the ad is digital marketing Cod that
is the Premier keyword or the most
searched keyword by which the ads of a
competitors also are showing and also I
want to show my ad for okay so what I
would do I would just go into this
beautiful tool I again repeat my steps I
can just go tool in settings Keyword
Planner open in a right tab why so that
your existing campaign settings are not
Disturbed okay you come here you click
this and you click discover new keywords
and you search your term like digital
marketing course click get
results and then you are able to see
digital marketing course in the period
of last one year in India of course you
can change the country to US Canada
Australia anywhere and you would see in
the last one year how many search
queries on a monthly basis have come for
this particular keyword in addition you
see lot of suggestions as well suppose
we just sticking around one keyword
right now to understand the bid part and
all so we see that we got around 1
million searches in India for this
particular keyword with the competition
of medium competition medium means that
most of the advertisers who are selling
this digital marketing course been
running the ad for the This this term or
not if this competition would have been
high then I should have ignored this
would have changed the keyword but this
is medium so I would take this and this
you know talks about the bid value this
is the low term and this is the high
term like low price means this is the
lowest price any of the advertisers
would have paid this year for this
particular term to show the ad and this
is the highest bid price which any of
the advertisers would have paid in this
year for this term so they doesn't tell
which part of year it was which
Advertiser it was but at least we get a
fair idea that our bid value would be be
around 46 to 195 so we go bit smart we
go on the average price suppose a bit 46
so I'll just go 30 40% over this price
so suppose I take 30% around 12 rupes or
13 rupees so that makes it 15 and around
60 rupees so this is the bid value I'm
aiming 60 rupees plus what I do I take
some of the keywords which I feel like
for my naked eye at this moment are very
important for my campaign just like I
take this I take this I take
this you know you can just take any of
them you can download this data into
Excel and copy paste as well so there
are lot of ways to do
this okay and then you can
certainly just name the new ad group and
they would be added to it or otherwise
it is very easy that we just copy them
from here okay there are ways to do it
so this is the simplest of the way
suppose I just liked all these keywords
from my product point of view and I like
the pricing as well so what I would do I
would just copy this copying
this and then putting into maybe
here so when there would be a space you
know when the campaign would ask me
please tell me for which keyword you
want to run the ad certainly it would
come here when we are done with these
two settings then I don't have to waste
time I will just go here and copy these
keyword and paste bed in here under the
keywords okay I can take more but before
uh you know uh the time exhaust because
I have a uh you know in my head that I
have to complete all the campaign
settings and everything within 1 hour so
that you're not bored of this and I want
that energy level to be on a high side
so uh you can do this research probably
and you can also you know add a lot of
keywords you know dependent on how much
uh you know you want to actually
leverage from them and as well more
keywords means you end up in paying your
budget you know in a very quick basis so
it's important that we segregate them
from the monthly searches High monthly
searches keywords are always important
because the demand is high and then we
always check the competition should not
be higher okay so I probably would not
take these you know because these are
high ones okay I can delete and I can
always aim the low ones like medium
medium medium and medium so I can just
take this okay so copy and probably
replacing
these because I got the better keywords
now as compared to the other ones
because they had the high competition
keywords as well so I'm just now aiming
the medium keywords with the higher
searches and I have just decided that I
would give the bid value or a highest
bid cap of a 60 rups because I have just
seen the average that if I have to rank
for this particular one or probably this
one or probably this one you know which
are on the higher side then I should be
paying 40 50% extra as uh you know
compared to the low priced okay so that
is how the bid value is calculated
roughly okay anyhow you would only pay
to uh you know outrank your competitor
that's how the algorithm works like you
will not going to pay high amount it is
like uh if three advertisers are bidding
on a certain term then if the next one
to you is paying 2 rup or $2 so just to
outrank him you would end up in paying
some amount over it like 2.1 or 2.2 it
is not like that you would be paying 40
rupees so that's how the algorithm
calculates okay you you put anything as
an account as a bid value but it will
only going to take have a CPC dependent
on how the competitors are working and
how their pricing is being given okay so
just on a safer side we give a average
price but moreover to save the cost of
the CPC we work on the quality score or
on the quality of our content and on the
ad which certainly is a very important
part okay so coming back to the campaign
making we come here and we give a bid
value suppose of 50 because this is what
we have seen or rather 60 from that
particular uh you know keyword sheet
from here 30 40% over this particular uh
keyword which is the most important one
for me and then I click
next once this is done then I just
select my Google search Network I don't
have to select the Display Network
because this will going to put my text
ad on the different websites and apps
Display Network are good when we are
running the banner ad because we just
running the search ad so we're just
going to keep it around the Google
search result and Google sites like
Google News Google Maps Google shop
Google uh YouTube so all the text add
wherever the placements can be given so
it will going to take directly we don't
put on our search Partners too because
that is again going to lose the
visibility search partners are like
ask.com AOL New York times.com okay so
again you know it is my strategy that I
don't want to increase the visibility
outside Google I'm very happy in showing
my most of the Impressions around Google
only okay or either on a Google widget
SL like this wherever the text ad has a
possibility just like you might be
wondering how come I said YouTube so if
I just go here and if I just type again
this so probably you would see text ads
on the top okay nowadays there are lot
of text ads been running so this is a
text ad okay this is not a video ad this
is not a banner ad this is the banner ad
this is the text ad okay so this is
coming from here
only Google sites okay then comes your
location you can run the ad on different
locations by you know sitting anywhere
suppose I want to run ad for the
worldwide then I'll select all countries
and territories if I want to select
particular country like India or I want
to select multiple countries like
suppose United
States or I want to
select uh
Canada or I want to select India too so
I can do this way okay then if I want to
exclude any of these states probably
suppose I want to exclude Texas from
here so I'll click Texas and I'll click
exclude I want to exclude
probably uh
Mumbai so Mumbai as a city can be
excluded and probably I want to exclude
Ontario from Canada because of XYZ
reasons just to explain the settings I'm
doing this so this is also done okay
then we also can use advaned search
where a beautiful setting of radius can
be worked and the second advantage of
Advan search tab is that you're able to
see the map so whatever you have
selected like we have selected Canada
and us and whatever you have deselected
or excluded will come in red blue part
included red part excluded the same way
you would see in India as well blue part
included and this small dot Mumbai
excluded okay plus we can do the radius
targeting here suppose I sell something
within the radius of 1 or 2 kilm or or 1
or two miles so I have to just select
that part suppose if I just deselect
India right
now and deselect the Mumbai exclusion as
well and consider that I have a
restaurant or a cake shop in
Delhi and probably I will also add this
keyword into my keywords so that that
matches the term if anybody body
searches this I have to be seeing the
character limits that's why you have to
be always checking and changing things
accordingly okay then digital marketing
Google then simply learn
till
[Music]
marketing digital
marketing on course probably if we can
get that
space
okay then going down and we can always
see where we are lacking right now so we
have uh not very good headlines been
added including popular keywords been
there description works well so let's
see what they give us the idea like so
they
say we are not given any online
availability brand call to actions okay
I'll just going to play with some of the
terms
now let's just see
CTA using the CT
now you can see the strength has
improved learn
I don't know it is
actually pausing my recording again and
again and that could be a disturbance
for you guys so I'm just taking some
time so that this comes back to
normal yes
okay so this is how you can add up to
headlines 10 headlines and that would
improve your ad strength and last not
least you can add the descriptions which
are very relevant to the add copy
okay try to get some headlines or
descriptions here from the landing page
okay once this is done you can just
click done
here and your ad copy is prepared you
can see here very much and click
next and then you can set up your budget
so the budget which we were talking
earlier in the Excel if I have to show
you so you got 100 clicks you have paid
1 rupe for every click so you have given
100 rupes per day so this is your daily
budget which you have spent okay so you
can always decide your daily budget by
setting or customizing it you can put
anything though it is showing dollars
but this is INR you can see here this is
kind of a bug which we are seeing since
almost a month now so your average daily
cost which they say like a weekly cost
rather after 41 multiplying by 33 for
aage CPC price would come to 13 get to
but we are giving a daily price so we
can always divide this by seven or you
know by 10 probably so I'm just giving a
rough number 100 okay or 1,000 could
have been given or 500 also could been
given okay so every day I would spend
500 and accordingly my clicks you know
would come and then you click
next and your ad goes to review like
they would going to be checking your
landing page they will be checking your
uh uh you know uh what else the ad copy
everything can be checked and would take
some time I think I just need to change
that let me just keep
it 5
a.m. so this is simpler
and then just click
next and publish the campaign from
here
publish so once this is done then your
add which can be checked from
here would go into a review part and it
would say under review Once this is
approved then your ad start showing and
you start seeing the results like
impression clicks and CD PC whatever we
have talked about okay so this is all
about the hard making now we can see
some of the important things here like
metrix we have
discussed all these we have discussed
CPC
conversions cost per
conversions CTR the only thing which we
have not discussed the quality score so
quality score is you know
completely um the part at at the back
endend which works like to improve our
ranking so quality score is something
which has been given out of 10 and when
we see a ad which is already been
created like suppose for this campaign
if I'll take you so if I just go to the
keywords so every keyword been given
quality score out of
10 okay so if any of the keyword has got
10 out of 10 it means there are three
important elements like their CTR like
how many have come their landing page
and their add copy is relevant or not
okay they see three elements how
relevant the landing pages how relevant
is the ad copy and certainly they see
how relevant being the ad copy with the
search then only your CTR increases
somebody searches something and the art
shows and if the clicks are high then
only CTR goes high so that's why the CTR
the landing page and the ad relevance
has to be above average that's how you
know they Define they don't give Marks
here they give total marks out of 10
here the quality score so above average
is going to be the highest average going
to be the middle one and the below
average going to be the lowest one okay
so if you have any issues uh in any of
these elements then your overall quality
score impacts okay this is all the
quality score so high quality score
means you end up in paying less and you
get a better value for your money okay
that's I think the last part of it so
Google ad ratings of quality of your ads
keyword and landing pages I think this
is what been given here as well then you
check I have already shown you you check
the keyword you check the timing which
which were the best timing you have
shown the ad which were the best
locations your ad has actually got the
result from and then accordingly your ad
can be optimized and can be changed you
change your budget you change your bid
price you change your location you
change your timing you change your
headline it all depends after your ad
actually been shown and then you
research or you do the analysis like you
know we are seeing which keyword is
working better which keyword is having
the best of the cost which keyword is
giving you the good impression to
interaction rate like a CTR then we
check the ad copy you know how the ad is
working suppose if I have multiple ads
to just compare if this ad works better
or this ad works better or this ad works
better so I was just going to be
comparing these three ads which one has
given me the better of the clicks as
compared to the other one which has
given me the better CTR who CPC was
lesser who CPC was higher that is how I
will be checking it okay I can always
have number of ads created under the
campaign just like AB right now we have
created one campaign one ad we can
always test with the another ad copy by
clicking this so that we can see which
ads performs better okay that's why in
this existing account you can see
multiple ads so because we were testing
which one works better so this is how
you can also make one another ad copy
and you can just click done and that
would be added to the list of ads okay
you can see now one more ad actually
been added so out of these two which one
works better would be only uh diagnosed
or checked if the ad starts running okay
you can always add your account the you
know money the the the building part
into this tool and settings building
summary and from here you just need to
add
your mode payment okay you have to
select your country you have to select
the currency you know you're are paying
in and then of course you would have
options to pay like debit money transfer
net banking and India PTM wallet is also
available very much
available okay hey guys welcome to
today's session my name is Sachin seel
and I'm here to talk about a very
important tool Google ads and out of all
the ads we can create under Google ads
today we would be talking about a very
important one Google search ad so this
is going to be very exciting this is
going to be very deep from my experience
I can say I will going to take you
through a lot of technical aspects and
lot of uh optimization strategies where
you can really bring down the cost down
if you're really paying high for your
clicks and conversion so please be with
me and I would try to give you the best
from my site great so let's just start
guys is Google ads is something which we
have discussed in the last class if you
have seen my last session if you have
not we will leave the link in the
description where we talked about the
basics of Google ads and we also talked
about how to create this beautiful ad
account or a tool with a free Gmail ID
okay we did talked about few more things
that how many types of ads you can
create just to give you the quick
Glimpse we are on Google and when we
type something like if I want to do a
data analytics
course so I would type few things like a
word or a keyword or a query into Google
search engine and then Google as a
search engine would show me few results
the results which we see on the top we
are talking about these today you know
this is the topic or this is the kind of
an ad which we would create today in
this session this is called text ad or
this is also called Google search ad
okay so this is the first type of an ad
you see or which you can create under
the Google ads there are few more just
like if you would go and search for any
of the e-commerce product probably by
winter
jacket
online so then there would be results
but in a different shape and color and
different structure there is an ad which
is a text ad but on the top we are able
to see some more ads but they are not
just text they have a pricing they have
a title they have a brand name they have
a image of the product so they are
called shopping ads or product listing
ads in addition to that sometimes you
know when you go to a product uh a
website like speed test and you see the
product ads
there but again in the different shape
and color so they are called display ads
because the been displayed on different
websites and different apps so why I'm
going so fast in explaining you
different type of ads because as I told
you we have another video created uh
with the name of uh Google ads uh for
beginners 2023 you can just check the
link in the description and you will
able to get all this type of ads and
whatever the uh you know bidding
strategies to be used in basic in that
particular tutorial or that demo just as
to show you if you can see that ads by
Google so this is the display ad or a
banner just quickly I have shown you
three types of the ads but our Focus as
I said today going to be on a very
specific ad which is the most important
ad from the Google ads family okay so
let's just begin
guys when I come to Google ads this is
how the Google ads structure looks
like we have a Google ads account
created again I repeat if you don't know
how how to create it please find the
link in the description to create the
Google ads account once a Google ads
account created then you would have a
dashboard like this okay in this
dashboard you can see there are
campaigns there are ad groups there are
ads there are videos there are landing
pages so a lot of things can be
confusing if you are just coming to this
account or to this beautiful tool for
the very first time so to just keep it
very simple or to explain in uh in a
very simpler way what I did is I just
drawn this structure for you okay so the
structure says that you have a Google
ads account imagine that I am a simply
learn Google ads manager so I running
the ads for all simply learn keywords
like data analytics course digital
marketing course or any machine learning
course python course so whenever
somebody types this so there's a ad
which shows like from Simply learn
probably we have to just assume because
currently I'm not able to see any simply
learn ad here
so data analytics course
India and then probably we can see if
there are any you can always change the
keywords but just to test I'm uh
randomly changing the words or I could
have just written simply Lear
specifically because I want to go with
simply Lear only I have researched a lot
and I feel like this is one of the best
okay so probably there is no ad
though still I will check
probably have to just change the
codes so I will go for the another
course which is by simply learn again
and then probably we can expect any of
the ads
running because this is not a very peak
time so we are probably you know saving
some of the cost not running the ads at
this odd hour anyhow so we can assume
that this is the ad you know I am
running for so how we can create this ad
how we can get the best of clicks as I
said it is not the very best time to run
the ad so this is also kind of a change
you know we can bring into our ads by
doing some research so how all these
things are done we're going to be
learning it okay so when we come here to
the dashboard and then we see our
dashboard looks like this a bit
complicated so we can be confused we can
be disheartened that I have created the
account by seeing uh the first video but
now I am all stuck okay so probably I
have to again wait so so the weight is
over now we are here to understand the
whole structure okay so let me just take
a very simple example suppose I uh I'm
someone who selling a shoes okay because
I have just said simply Lear probably
let's just convert it to any of the
Google ads account of a Sho seller
probably I'm Nike okay and I am making
the ad for Nike shoes and I am selling
uh two types of the Nike shoes today
probably formal or Canvas OR probably
I'm selling the casual or any sports
shoes and what I did I created the
campaign named it search ad uh any month
you know whatever the month you have
started with suppose November so
November 2022 that is the name which I'm
giving name can be changed name is
something which has been put it up for
my reference so that after creating lot
of campaigns I'm not confused in which
campaign I have to check the results
okay so I'm running the search chart for
shoes for the month of February or
November or December 22 23 whatever and
then I open two ad groups into it why
I'm opening two ad groups under one
campaign because I'm selling two kind of
products under the shoes only I'm
selling formal also under the shoes only
I'm selling casual also so what happens
suppose I would have just you know
created one ad group and would have
inserted or uh submitted all the
keywords of formal and Casual inside one
ad group then if somebody would have
searched a term called called formal
black shoes then this ad group would
have got confused that should I show
formal ad shoes or should I show casual
ad shoes because what I did I have just
got all my keywords like formal casual
Cricket shopping jogging party office
you know all the mixed of the keywords
from formal and Casual family into the
same ad group the moment any of these
six keywords been typed or being
searched on Google then this ad group
would have got triggered and then again
randomly it would have shown the ad of a
formal or add of a casual because both
of the ads would have been under this
okay but after doing uh this bif
foration or after doing this
segmentation what would happen all the
formal keywords like party shoes office
shoes formal shoes formal black shoes
would go here this ad group would
trigger if any of this keyword would
searched and accordingly this ad which
has everything related to only formal
shoes will be shown and of course with
that add the landing page is connected
which uh would be open you know when
somebody clicks the ad okay and WIA
Versa if somebody would have searched
for a casual term like a casual shoes
sports shoes jogging shoes running shoes
then this ad group would have triggered
and then the casual shoes ad with all
the headline related to that casual
keywords would have been shown and
accordingly if somebody would have
clicked then the landing page of casual
shows uh you know would have opened okay
so if this is clear actually you are
very much ready to uh dive into the
Google ads because many people takes a
lot of time to understand the structure
because uh you know maybe they are very
much confused at the ad group level but
I have just tried my level best by
bringing this example why I am creating
two different ad groups why I'm not just
going with the same ad group you know
mixing all the
keywords second scenario could have been
or a second permutation could have been
I would have just you know probably
created two different campaigns Al
together I would have named The Campaign
one with search ad formal shoes November
okay then only the only this part would
have belonged to the first campaign then
I would have created a different
campaign all together and I would have
named it campaign search ad casual shoes
November then this second campaign or a
second campaign can be assumed here with
you know with a green color would have
been drawn okay so this is how on the
structure it works like we can always
now create inside so let's just see few
things uh before we create the ad okay
very important uh requirement or rather
I would say uh if being the campaign
manager of any any any any any uh
company you name any startup you name or
any client you work with or probably for
yourself as well you have to be very
much sure how these terms works like
Okay so this terms when I talk about is
going to be bit inclined towards the
search at today only and when I talk
about the display in the next video then
I would you know take you through about
the terminologies and all the kpis of
display Banner or a video ads okay so
now if I talk about a search ad a very
important
um term which we should be aware of is
the maximum bid price okay because we
all know when we talking about this ad
which is called a text ad then we are
paying on every click okay that's why
this is also called PPC ad this is also
called PPC marketing or you can
understand in a very simpler words uh
Advertiser which uh is emiritus this in
this particular ad only has to pay when
somebody like such In This Moment
clicking this ad I click this ad I reach
to the landing page of this particular
University or this college and uh
certain amount is deducted from this
particular ad account and that certain
amount actually decides or decided on
the basis of the keyword helped to show
this ad okay so as an Advertiser must
have paid something to Google ads for
showing this ad for this keyword okay so
when I say a maximum bid price it means
it's a maximum bid price of a keyword
that's why now this would be easier to
understand by this example suppose I
want to run the ad on the term called
data analytics course
2022 what I did I have opened the Google
Keyword Planner you know I did talked
about this in the previous session but I
will take you through again how you use
a Keyword Planner smartly so I have got
this data from the keywords planner that
the average price I have to pay for this
key to show my ad is 5 to 10 Rupees so
what I did I just played a bit of maths
and I have bidded something over the
minimum bid price okay this is the
minimum bit price this is the maximum
bit price okay and this is what I've got
from the Keyword Planner so rather than
going for a very high price or the
maximum bit price to secure my position
I want to play safe and what I would do
I would just take um chance maybe 30 40%
over the minimum bid range and then I
will see if the Impressions or clicks
are coming or not if this starts coming
it means that my ad is accepted and my
keyword is you know winning in the
auction and I'm able to get the clicks
but if it is not picking then certainly
I have to increase my bit price but
coming back to the terminologies what we
talking here is once I have seted up my
maximum bit price of 7 rupees then my ad
would start showing suppose my ad shows
for thousand times today and and every
time when my ad being clicked you know
certain amount being deducted there is a
competition there are other advertisers
also you know who are running the ad and
after showing my ad for the whole day
Google in the dashboard just shown that
you have paid average CPC of 5 rupees
only so I bid it for seven but by seeing
different uh you know factors like the
competition the demand and how many
times the ads got clicked what was the
position where my ad was sh sh I ended
up in paying 5 rupees for every Click by
the end of a day so the average CPC
sometimes you know people get confused
they have a CPC and the maximum bid
price the same no so maximum bid price
is something which I uh you know submit
to Google that this is the maximum I can
pay for my ad to show on certain keyword
for every click and a a CPC is something
which actually you know I pay every day
or you know in that average of the
duration you had got displayed or got
clicks uh for every uh click on that
particular keyword okay or the number of
keywords if you have more than one
keyword uh submitted and suppose I got
100 clicks then you know it's a simple
math that my budget which I have spend
today is 5 rupees for one click 500
rupees for 100 click so daily budget
would be 500 rupees and tomorrow if
company says I need 300 clicks then of
course my uh average CPC which I have
from the historical data of yesterday
you know I would just do my maths and I
will going to submit the daily budget of
not 100 rather 300 today so that in
1,500 I can expect 300 clicks at the
cost of 5 rupees per click okay so this
is a very simple of the example to just
make you explain how things works you
know you submit something then on the
basis of a lot of factors you know
Google calculates Google gives you
clicks and once you have the data then
you know you can just understand how
this all is working
okay last thing before we dive into the
tool is Keyword Planner so I just told
you we have done in the last class how
this works like so we go into tool and
setting and then we go into Keyword
Planner I'll show you in the account
also the Google ads account just after
30 seconds uh the screenshots over so
your Keyword Planner opens and then you
discover the keyword suppose I am
selling data analytics course so I would
just put my search term data analytics
codes and then I'll click the get result
and then accordingly it will show me lot
of options and this is the pricing I was
talking about it gives me the low price
and the high price so I would take the
30 40% over the low bit price or the
average price between these both and
that would be my maximum bid price and
after checking all the permutations
Google would show my ad or either it
would not show my ad also there can be a
chance so I have to just wait for my
impression and clicks and the results by
the end of a day and I would you know I
would know uh how much the average CPC
actually I'm paying for each keyword
okay so I'll show you all those reports
in a while uh that's it right now let's
just go and see few things so the
Keyword Planner will start with suppose
I start um you know in researching all
these things my campaign is about data
analytics course I'm making it for
simply and probably and I would go and I
would just try to you know search into
the planning my Keyword Planner and then
I will write a term quickly here you
know whatever I want to show my ad for
suppose data analytics course as I
said okay probably let's say digital
marketing because we would have
more uh results so it's easy to
understand with lot of results because I
would able to tell you how to sort and
filter them down uh disal marketing
course and you can just test it with any
of the keywords I'm just doing a random
check so once we are here we have lot of
keywords in addition to what we have
submitted so the keyword which I have
provided is this and the result shows
that it had over 100k uh you know um
monthly searches and uh of course in the
range of 1 million in the in the you
know in the month of 2021 to September
2022 so this is actually the average
monthly searches happened in between
this period and uh the advertise is
actually paid as low as 44 Rupees to as
high uh 224 rupees okay that can easily
be uh you know converted to dollars uh
half a dollar or maybe more than half a
dollar uh 6070 cents probably and uh
this is like going to be a $3 cost okay
so what we can do is we can see now
there are a lot of keyword been given
and we can easily sort them down here on
certain you know uh basis like you know
suppose the monthly searches are high or
the bid is low and all that stuff but
this is quite you know difficult when we
have to sort down here in the Keyword
Planner so what I do is I'm just going
to talk about the same you know like hi
how I actually go when I am working for
my clients okay I have clients here a
lot of clients I don't want to show you
but yeah I have and um suppose I just go
and download this data from here and
then this would be you know uh download
in the Excel format and we can just save
it anywhere suppose I just bring it here
and then now I would open the keyword
sheet and I would have a data in my
Excel okay so I need this this one so
this is the most important colum because
I have to highlight uh which column is
important and what is not required right
now so whatever is required I'm just
I'll be keeping with me and what I feel
like is not very important as of now I'm
just not going to be taking them so now
there are are five column which I have
kept with myself like these four where
we talk about the
results and the keyword okay uh this is
not required this is not required I'm
just going to be deleting or hiding them
okay so when we talk about a competition
index value so this actually tells us
that a particular keyword is how much um
you know from the competition point of
view is difficult to to rank suppose I
talk about two key ones right now let me
just take um one with a lower score
suppose this one and I would take the
higher or the highest one probably is
this one okay so now when I talk about a
comparison you know probably uh or or
probably let's say this this one because
this has monthly searches which are
equivalent uh you know from the uh
competition point of view they are very
different but the search has been same
so if I would stuck to something of this
sort that if I have to finalize between
these two so what I would do you know
that that's something which we are
talking here you know if we have a kind
of a combination where we have to decide
out of these two so both of uh the
keywords mean very important if I would
just check from my naked eye a quick
Scan they look very promising they look
very great to me suppose and they have a
equivalent number of searches in the
last you know one year on the average
monthly basis but there is a difference
between the competition okay now people
can be confused what is this competition
so I would just make you explain in a
very simpler way Suppose there are 100
companies or there are 100 you knowtech
institutes or probably physical
institutes who teaches uh digital
marketing because we are doing online
marketing or you know digital marketing
course online so so let's keep it uh
online uh institutes like simply learn
and all okay so what they have done is
in the last one here they all have used
these keywords to run their ads you know
to show their advertisement or their
digital ad on a Google space okay when
this data has been given so this is
telling me that out of those 100
advertisers or my 100
competitors 66 or a
66% advertisers have used this ad okay
or have used this keyword to show their
ad okay and out of 100
33% or if it is 100 uh then 33
advertisers have used this keyword to
show their ad okay so it brings you know
kind of a uh comparison to US that
probably these two keywords are very
much in demand you know like uh equally
from the searches point of view because
both have been searched equally but
whenever this has been searched then
there has been a competition where where
66 people or 66 advertisers or 66%
advertisers are fighting to show their
ad okay and when this keyword being
searched as equally then only 33% or 33
people or 33 advertisers are fighting to
show their ad on Google space okay when
I talk about 100 then that seems to be
okay where my ad would look like you
where my ad would show because if I just
go on a Google space you know that only
seven ads are shown when you know when
we go on a Google search engine 1 2 3
and four and then the rest three would
be at the bottom if they are shown at
this moment or not I'm not very sure so
three would be here somewhere so total
seven ads placement on the first page
nobody goes beyond first we know that 97
of the worldwide audience don't go
beyond the first page ination okay so we
have to be on our first page so if I
talk about from the first page seven
positions point of view it would make
more sense so let's imagine there are
only 10 advertisers of digital marketing
course so out of 10 if I take out 66 66%
then it means almost like six to seven
advertisers are fighting or have bided
or probably are trying to outrank each
other to show their ad on the top or on
the first four positions of Google but
when I talk about this then only three
to four advertisers are fighting or have
bided for this keyword to show the ad on
the first page so this actually is a
very important data sometimes we just
you know Miss it because uh it has not
been uh I think explained anywhere else
that what exactly this value is we only
go by the low medium high which is the
very first column I delete nowadays you
know I don't you know go by this because
they both come under the medium but
there's a big difference you know 7 out
of 10 would have been bided for and only
three to four would have been bided for
this keyword so never go by the high Med
medium or low just go by the index value
because that's a percentage of The
Advertiser who are actually trying to
fight for the same keyword to show their
ad on the top okay this is how we you
know shorten or we get the best keywords
we try to get the best search keyword
with the you know kind of a index value
between 50 to 60 less than that and then
we of course you know go for the bid
value or a bid uh price which is also on
a very lower side not a very high price
keyword we go with so this is the
criteria you know I actually follow and
that's something which you know you can
see I have also mentioned here you can
see that much uh you know we go for the
high search keyword and then we try to
get the low medium competition keywords
which of course less than 60 index value
and then I put a price you know kind of
a price of my price you know which is
like if the low bid price is 10 Rupees
then I just make it 13 by adding 30% to
it so if the pricing is 10 so I would
add 30% % over it that makes my price 13
and then I check you know uh if the
first day if the Impressions has come it
means my price actually been accepted
but if any of the keyword my price is
not accepted then I would again revise
the price by 20 30% and then would wait
for the second day report and that's how
you know I keep changing for the first 2
3 days and keep seeing the results and
once the you know every keyword gets
pick up and I get the you know starts
getting the stable results then I uh
just just allow the campaign to work uh
you know on the algorithm and uh you
know I I see uh results actually moves
in the positive direction when you give
some time to campaigns to read and to
learn uh you know from the audience
Behavior okay so this is about the
keyword planning which we have just seen
now moving to again a very important
aspect because campaign making is
something which I've already given you
the you know Glimpse in the last class
so I would again give you today but
before that I really you know wanted
today to speak on all these technical
aspects you know which works at the back
end so that's why my focus is more on
this uh presentation par I would keep
showing you the uh you know uh the uh
Google ads uh the demo and everything
okay so now when we move to the next
part next part is very important from
the um ad algorithm point of view so
what happens or what used to happen uh
when when the quality score you know
which I'm just trying to speak now was
not there uh what used to happen the one
who used to pay the highest bid price
used to get the first position and the
second one used to get the second
position and the third bidder used to
get the third position so I have just
brought into this table suppose a
Advertiser has bid at 8 rupe B 10 C 15
and D 20 and when the quality score
concept was not there so they actually
been given the very direct position this
one first this one second this one third
and this one fourth
but they have realized or Google has
realized that the one who is paying the
most is not having a very good quality
of the ad uh his uh landing page or the
website it's is not working or probably
the pages which is which are connected
are not very relevant and the keywords
on which the ads been shown is nowhere
near uh you know when the landing page
is opened so it it was like a very
negative impact on Google when the
reviews been checked and people or the
user who were clicking on those ads were
not happy so what Google did Google
brought us you know kind of um uh test
score or a check uh which is called
quality score for every keyword we bid
okay and this is only for the search ads
that's why I said all the keywords we
bid okay I'll just show you the result
on a client site so when we submit our
ad on the basis of you know different
keyword we bid and the and the strategy
we use and the landing page we connected
the back end so what the system does is
system starts analyzing and starts
checking everything from top till you
know bottom from the start till the end
and I would just talk about the factors
and what impact it brings is so the
quality score the score which has been
given out of 10 is then been given to
every Advertiser on the basis of the
keyword suppose every uh Advertiser here
is bidding on the same keyword you know
let's let let's um assume that they all
are running the ad for the digital
marketing course so what would happen
they would check and and on the basis of
the you know factors they would give us
score out of 10 suppose the a Advertiser
who bid it for the least had the best of
the quality score because of the reasons
we're just going to talk about B got8
out of 10 four out of 10 and two out of
10 so the one who have bided the most
got the very least quality score
probably the reasons you know would be
more clear once we talk so how this now
we're going to impact the whole position
system is that their Google rank not
Google position okay there is a Google
rank kind of a uh kPa can be understood
or a metrix which is um a product or a
multiplication of what you bid and how
much quality score you were able to get
so 8 into 9 brings 72 10 into 8 brings
80 15 into 4 brings 60 and 22 is 40 okay
so the combination of a good pricing and
a good quality score got B bidder as a
first position okay and the one who got
the best quality score but still paying
very less from the average pricing
probably is you know brought the Google
position or art position to Second and
then the one who was spraying very high
but the quality score was below average
which is of course 56 is average price
average score they've got into third
position and the one who was paying so
high probably would not get a position
because this is the maths from the maths
point of view I've got these numbers if
the quality score would have been below
five then the ad would not have got any
position rather because Google always
tries to you know show the ads which are
the best uh for the users you know
because Google always pays very
importance to the users behavior and
users um uh you know expectations so and
when I said that I think you would able
to understand more now how the factors
you know which which actually results in
these quality score is um like relevance
score like by relevance score means when
you type A quiry or a person would come
here would type A quiry so he doesn't
know that this is called a keyword we as
a digital marketers know this is called
a keyword for them it is a normal query
because they are about to start a course
where they would be taught about all
these things but right now to they are
not very aware you know very much aware
of these things so they are putting a
query when they put a query they want to
see the ad or add extensions or a add
description relevant to what they have
searched and when they see all these
three things here with the search uh you
know what they made they would
definitely going to click more and
Google only earns when somebody clicks
so it means Google making Revenue only
when somebody's clicking so from that
perspective also Google always tries to
pay you know or rather give more score
and I give a better position to the ads
where all the components of the ads are
perfect are relevant and the ones who
starts getting more clicks in the very
first hour or a first day okay so the
important factor which after the click
is the landing page so when somebody
opens this so it has to be very relevant
to the query and to whatever being shown
outside they cannot just show anything
here uh which is not relevant to the ad
which has actually been shown outside so
all these uh you know uh factors uh in
combination gives the quality score very
important factor is
CTR which you must have understood when
you know we uh I I did you know explain
the last session the basic one but if
you do not aware of it so CTR is called
click through rate okay and a click-
through rate is a ratio of clicks to
impression okay it is a ratio of clicks
to
impression just spell check okay so
suppose
today uh when we are saying AB BCD so
let's see this are this is a or this is
B and this is C and they've got you know
equivalent quality score on the basis of
all what they have done okay their
landing page their uh ad their
description everything is very much
common so Google in the starting of the
day you know when the ad actually
started to show for everyone uh you know
given them a very good quality score
probably of five okay and when this
quality score of five been given to them
then the other factor which actually
adds on you know to that algorithm is
the CTR so CTR is I just told you is the
ratio between click to impression so now
they all have a same quality score but
this got 100 clicks out of the th000
Impressions been given today this got 50
clicks out of the th000 Impressions
given today this got by any mean
probably 200 clicks out of the th000
Impressions given today okay every time
this this search is happening here
digital marketing course so these three
ads are very much visible equally so all
got th000 Impressions thousand
Impressions thousand Impressions but
this got 100 clicks this got 50 clicks
and this got 200 in the very first hour
or maybe in the next two hours okay so
this CTR you know when we are talking
about 100 out of, to 10% This Is 50 out
of th000 it means this is going to be 5%
and 20 uh sorry 200 out of th000 means
20% of the CTR so Google was actually
benefited or made the most of the
revenue when know clicks have come from
here because it is almost like a double
or a four times of this so because of
the high CTR the quality score of of
course you know every every Advertiser
would improve but this one would be
improved from probably from 5 to 7 and
this would you know probably from 5 to
5.5 and this probably from 5 to six so
because of that quality score has
improved and uh you know because of the
high CTR this ad has got so this
position will be changed and this would
know probably would get the first
position the second position and at the
end of a day this ad has to pay or
Advertiser has to pay lesser because its
quality score increase we have just seen
it is you know almost like the uh you
know inversely proportional the ones who
are actually paying or the ones who are
having the best of the quality score are
paying the least or has to pay the least
okay so this is all basically you know
can be checked once your ad starts
running so I would just open the
client's account uh where you can just
see this
with you know bit
better understanding you would be able
to get out of
this hopefully I able to show you from
okay I'll just see because I have
multiple advertisers you know but I
canot just show for all so let me just
check if I can show you from any of the
older
one just wait it is actually asking me
some
verification it's taking too much
time yeah it's is done now
okay so once this is done
so I will just take you to one of the
accounts where my main focus would be to
just show you how the quality score
report look like and then you know you
would get a fair idea what all the
factors you have to be focusing to bring
your qualty score high or to take your
qualty score high
okay so I'm just going to open the
search ads because we talking about a
search ad here only and suppose if I
just go into this uh Campaign which is
of course you know not running right now
but I just want to show you how to check
the report and all suppose this is the
campaign you have run for and you got 75
clicks at a you know um average CPC
price of 40 PESA and you have just given
this much pricing and I have bided for
many keywords but I want to see which
keyword had got the best of the quality
score and how the quality score been
given and all okay so once you reach to
the keyword report here you know at this
level then you see
um uh you know uh the kpis or metrics
here which gives equality score out of
10 okay you can see here very well and
every keyword being given you know if if
there are 10 keywords I don't know how
many keywords we bided for we bided 50
keywords okay and um you know you can
see all the keywords here and every
keyword been given the quality score out
of 10 okay because their CTR which was
the last part which I've explained you
the ratio between the impression two
clicks got the above average so they
below average average and above average
so above average is best actually for
any of the factors so the CTR is above
average the landing page is above
average and their add is above average
means all are perfect then they got the
10 the moment anything goes below
average or probably to the average
suppose you can see this is above
average for them this is above average
for them but their landing page
experience from this keyword point of
view is only average their quality score
has come to eight okay if you go further
down uh let's see anything where two of
them uh yeah so here the kids ride on is
a keyword where CTR is also not as high
or as great in know to as compared to
the other keywords which we have seen
and also the landing page is not as
relevant to the keyword so there uh two
factors like CTR and landing page has
come to average as compared to the ad
relevance which is above average so
their whole quality score got impact
which actually came down from 10 to 8
and then 7 for this particular keyword
and last not t i just take you to
somewhere where something is below
average has come now one is above
average one is okay they are getting
clicks but probably the ad is still not
very much relevant to the keyword okay
so they are below average above average
average has brought the quality score to
6 out of 10 which certainly would have
you know impacted on the cost and also
to the position okay so this is
something which you would see when you
come here also you can check one more
thing here suppose you have bided for
your keyword and your bid price where
you are paying for is maximum bid price
let me just see where that column is so
otherwise I would just add that column
so that you can learn that part as
well
[Music]
okay just wait okay so this is basically
CPC price is being given in the average
cost 2.50 is the cost for every click
and we got 249 clicks so got 623 you can
just check the mats it's always good to
cross check so 249 clicks multiplied by
the CPC price which is 2.50 rupe would
give you 6 22.5 which is the cost you
know or the keywords uh
you know we bid it for and the total
clicks we have paid okay and the maximum
bid price suppose you know you have got
uh the maximum bid price of uh 1 rupe
and you paid 17 PESA 1.66 and all and
then what happens you want to secure
your position suppose the very first
page bid you're seeing that you're
getting the position but you're not
getting on a first page then here
because this campaign is not running so
I'm just giving you the hypothetic
example so whatever the pricing you
would have given for the particular
keyword suppose we talk about these
three keywords right now or particular
one keyword I suppose so this is
something which I'm know trying to show
on a one rupe cost but to show on the
first page it is saying that you have to
pay 1.5 okay to show on the uh first
four positions here 1 2 3 4 it is saying
that probably you have to pay 2.5 and to
get the absolute Lo first position which
is going to be the topmost it would tell
you that you have to probably pay 5 rup
you know you're paying one it is asking
1.5 the first four it can be paid for
2.53 or this has to be five so you can
always go and change your you know bid
price for the particular keyword okay so
there are ways to do it suppose if I'll
just go here and I just go to the edit I
can change my maximum CPC bid price for
this particular
or a keyword like to 5 rupe okay because
I'm not changing for all the keywords so
I have selected that particular keyword
and I have made the change to this
particular keyword to 5 rupe so if you
know the average price was one and I was
not getting the keyword uh from this
keyword the position secured on the
first page or first absolute position
and I want because this is the most
important keyword for me then I would
just come here and would check the
pricing okay this says 5 rupees you have
to pay for the top position so I will
just go here edit and would change the
bid price or a maximum CPC bid price of
this particular keyword you can do for
all you know you have to just of course
you know select all of course but if you
would do for all then it it can really
impact your whole budget okay so try to
go for the keywords where you really
feel like it is required and always go
by the quality score it has you know it
has a very good quality score so I
should be paying or I should be ready in
paying uh the maximum price which
actually Google is asking me to pay to
secure my first absolute position and
certainly that would increase the
chances of clicks and certainly if
clicks are there so conversion can be
expected to okay so this is all from
what I've just taught you as of now now
I would just move to the campaign making
though we have done as I told you last
time but I will try to make it again so
that we can quickly see how the Google
ad search ads or the search Google ad
created okay so if I just go to the
campaign uh My Demo account so I have
just go to the Google ads account the
dashboard and then I would come to the
campaigns I will just click
plus new
campaign and whatever the you know um
objective is you can always go for
website traffic or without a guidance
because this would have all the settings
inside the same more important part is
what we select next so we select search
campaign because we are making the ad
for the search Network you can always
test for website traffic that would not
make much difference and click continue
I will talk about the conversions and
remarketing in a separate uh session all
together so we are not doing the
conversion and remarketing today we
making a normal search ad with all the
strategies we have just understood and
with uh adding the extensions to the ad
as well today okay okay website visit
and suppose my website is um just open
safy
learns uh landing
page so that I can make the ad for
simply addal marketing as a demo ad of
course not a main ad so copying and just
putting in here I have to just put a uh
you know website domain that's it I
don't have to bring the whole landing
page here and then I can just name it
probably no
search
add and then I would just go and
continue start
new and then I'll just select my bidding
strategy which is going to be clicks and
of course from my Excel I would learn
that okay my bid price which I'm going
to be paying uh you know uh is certainly
in the range of something like probably
50 60 and I have just told you that I
bring my price kind of a thing into this
like I always bring like this and then
let me just delete all the other column
which are not
required so this is the sheet which I
did explain you earlier with the index
value and all so my price what is my
price like so I always pay 30% 40% extra
to the low bit price so I can you know
just get the formula here like
this Plus
this
30% okay so that is just going to make
it 57 so you can just understand 44 + 13
going to bring 57 and I can just drag it
and now I've got the average suppose
these are the you know keywords which I
have finalized just assuming so these
are the keywords which I have finalized
probably because of X YZ factors suchar
as an index value and all that and I see
that my pricing is very in from 35 to 89
so maximum paying 89 so what I would do
keeping that in my head I would going to
give the limit to my bid price that I
don't want to pay anything extra or more
than 90 okay so this is something which
you can do on this particular level and
then you move ahead and you remove this
because you just want to keep your ad on
the Google search and then you go down
you select your countries you select
your location if you want to show the ad
in all the location ations then you
certainly can just go uh and keep the
very first option open which is all
countries and territories if you want to
just show your ad um uh in a particular
country like you know right now if I
just go India so the whole India would
see your ad and if you want to go for a
manual locations like suppose I want to
select any of the states or cities then
what I would do I would just probably
take Delhi so Delhi would be targeted
like this okay or probably I just want
to Target the state of Texas here so I
just would go and Target the whole state
or if I want to Target any of the
provinces of Canada so I would just go
and take the uh provinces of Ontario
Canada and I would just Target the whole
Province and now if I also want to go
for any of the uh PIN codes suppose I
want Target to a certain pin code then I
can just go and Target the PIN codes
like this so it is up to us that we want
to go worldwide or if you want to go for
a country specific if you want to go for
a state specific or if you want to go as
a province or a pin code specific okay
otherwise uh if you suppose um a
restaurant or if you are a you know
somebody who only delivers into certain
radius then you can just leave all these
options and you can go and advance
search and then you can go into radius
and you can just bring this uh whatever
you understand better in India we
understand kilometers better maybe the
person in us would understand miles
better so we just go and take that 2
kilomet radius and probably I am the
cake shop in Delhi so I was just going
to search my location this is my
location and I was just going to Target
people around 2 km because I don't
deliver outside 2 km
so it's all up to us how we want to go
uh this is called radius targeting or
Geo fencing when we go to the location
we can also learn one thing suppose I
want to show the art to the um whole
country India I've targeted at the same
time I am not delivering in um uh in in
in Mumbai okay or probably in uh
Karnataka you know bangaluru where the
city is okay probably I'm not delivering
in any of the uh Northern States like
harana Himachal Punjab so what I would
do I would just take Punjab suppose for
example and I'm just going to exclude
that okay so what would happen now my ad
would show in all the states and all the
cities of India but just not in Punjab
okay so I can save it that's how you go
about the location language is you know
in which language the users probably
uses the search engine and all so you
can keep it all languages that's the
best and audience we don't cater here
much because we are doing the search ad
which actually shows the ad on the basis
of keywords and location only so in the
display ad we're going to talk about
this uh one and that would be the next
video I would create so we're going to
learn a lot of things from the audience
segment in the next display ad and then
the more settings comes where you talk
about the ad rotation so ad rotation is
uh already default being selected as the
perform best ad uh if uh because the
nowadays the ad actually been created uh
responsive and dynamic so when we'll
reach to the ad level I'll show you uh
the headline changes for every user the
description some sometimes changes for
the user what I mean is if such is
selecting or you know writing this
keyword so probably this headline is
shown to me and after 1 hour if I'll
come again and put search the same term
so the headline from the same Advertiser
could be different or the description
could be different so that's how the
dynamic ADS works like okay so once you
are done with this okay the start and
dat is important you know the basics
from the previous chapter so I'm just
going a bit faster in here so you would
select the date and then if you want to
schedule this campaign for a certain
period like suppose you don't want to
run on the weekends so you can just
select Monday to Fridays and you know
our timing whichever suits you suppose
just like a very common time of 8:00
a.m. to uh you know the late nights like
23:45 and you don't want to run the
weekends if you want um Saturday Sunday
to be you know 24 hours then you don't
have to put any timing so that goes like
24 hours for Saturday Sundays and then
you click next and you reach to the next
level where it will just going to ask
you for certain things like keywords you
want to submit and the ad you want to
run for and the add copy you know you
have to create okay so once you come
here it uh is the you know work you have
done so you can just copy paste them and
you know bring in there uh and otherwise
these all keywords are the ones which
Google has suggested you from you know
the page which you have submitted okay
so the landing page is this so I'll try
to change the landing page first so that
I can get more appropriate keywords and
then it would going to search again or
scan again for us update keyword
suggestions of course we can always
click on and now the keywords would be
more digital marketing oriented because
this landing page will be scanned by
Google and this would show us certain
results which would of course going to
be digital marketing oriented but why we
don't just uh you know use them because
we don't know uh what is the pricing of
these keywords is what is the
competition of these keywords is how
much the monthly search has been so we
go by our own maths we we calculate we
do all this pre- homework on the Keyword
Planner sheet just like we did today and
then we bring them here by deleting all
what they have actually submitted or
suggested us okay and once this is done
then we ensure that our keyword uh uh
you know in the headlines and everything
being used how the copy is created I'll
just show uh you some you know strategic
part of it ensure that your landing page
is correct and it is opening there you
know otherwise your ad would not be
approved secondly always give a display
path display path is something which is
added after the ad or the landing page
link suppose I'm selling
online digital marketing so I would just
going to write whatever I want to show
okay probably I'll just keep it
here
marting okay so that works okay so now
it has come Ral marketing and then the
part comes where you know you have to
be I'll just going to tell you the call
extension once the art is created so
headlines and all so the headline is
something which
shows you know you know the basics so
I'll be fast again under the landing
page link this blue which actually uh
you know brings the most of the
engagement or which actually appeals the
user to click it is something in blue
which is you know going to be the
headline so we have to be focusing very
much on bringing the best of the
headlines here so that we can get the
best of the clicks because you know once
the click increases the CTR increases
CTR increases the quality score would
increase quality score would increase
your costing would come down and your
position would rise so you have to
ensure that your headlines your clicks
everything is in you know in a line
whatever we have learned so your
headlines right now has been given these
of course they are not very relevant so
we're going to just bring the headlines
which we feel like are more relevant to
the ad we are showing okay and I'm just
going to get the headlines as a
suggestion being given okay and um we
can have more ideas from here by
clicking this so they are not giving any
so we can always have from the keywords
which we have submitted so probably
digital marketing course
online try to get your best keywords
here this is okay this is nice this can
be
changed
digital marketing
course online is not taking so Marketing
Online probably I'll just take because
course are already submitted and then I
can take few more more like social media
marketing I just
seen whatever the length it would accept
I'll take otherwise I'll delete the
rest this is the one and I should ensure
that I have at least 10 headlines or 12
headlines so six been given and headline
section actually you know being given
like a half blue and then I would see
headlines which are unique so unique you
should have a uh you know online
availability benefits and offers and all
or call to action so
enroll
register
today for free
demo then we'll talk
about you can see the moment I've added
the headline this the strength has
changed 100 uh
plus tools for
free
job
assistance
program okay so I'm just adding few
random things I'm just not paying much
attention but yeah of course we would
have seen these headlines in any of the
atank companies ads uh include some
popular keywords keywords could be your
brand name as well so
simply learn
courses
online hopefully the spelling is fine
and
um
weekend batch
for professionals
um just a batch for
professionals and that's it you know
because I already added a lot of
keywords lot of headlines probably 11 so
I would just not work on the headlines
anymore uh and I'll see you know if
description doesn't takes it high then
I'll I'll just add one more but right
now the description is also not giving
me the full uh tick like in the headline
unique and the headlines been given so
I'll just try to bring the description
so simpl online online that's great
that's great I would just try to get
something from Google itself let's see
what they have given so I'll just going
to bring this one okay so that it is
been taken from the landing page itself
so that would make a difference
to uh the quality score simp digital
marketing courses focus on so we're just
going to
put our courses focus on skills
focus
on else
like PC
analytics this one here so that has been
picked up so now you can see this is
also been picked up and the last thing I
would do is now going to bring some
headline again you know I'll just check
probably uh digital marketing
certification I'm not sure if this
headline I have summed earlier or not
but I'm just going to test it out okay
so
training so now it has you know come
down to good and uh that's the best you
know right now we can do of course so
you can take it further but yeah that
doesn't um
uh matter if you are just stuffing it to
get this one completed you have to just
ensure that all the keywords or all the
headlines are relevant just do not
overdue 10 to 12 are okay okay once this
is done your ad is created you can just
click done and you can click
next and then your budget so we just
discussed about the budget when I was
explaining we'll just take you back so
because you know that your a CPC price
would be around 80 you know whatever the
pricing you have just got from here if
you know the sheet when I was explaining
you so the the the bid price which you
have submitted for you know when I told
you is like something which is in this
range uh 80 90 whatever it is so you
know that bid price would come down to
90 and you need um at least 100 clicks
today so 90 into 100 going to be your
9,000 daily budget so because you know
that you know you would end up in paying
maximum 90 rupees per click because
that's the maximum bid price you have
submitted if that comes down to 70 80 60
then of course your clicks would
increase but right now to being very uh
you know hypothe hypothetically thinking
that okay I would pay 90 rupees per
click at Max because that is what I
submitted so to get 100 clicks I have to
pay 90 into 100 it would be 9,000 your
you know daily budget has to be so you
would come here and you were just going
to change it set a custom budget and you
would going to bring down 9,000 rups
here okay so on that aage CPC whatever
it would be you would get the number of
FS if your a CPC goes down from 90 to 45
then of course you are not going to get
only 100 you'd rather get double amount
which is going to be 200 okay when that
is done then you just click next and
your budget goes uh you know your
campaign goes for a
review and then you can add the
extensions from outside okay so they're
just giving you some of the uh you know
kind of uh suggestions so let's see uh
there is one issue in the ad
let me just check that
first let me just
see you can always fix
it but that would again you're not going
to give you the option of um publishing
you know till you fix it but it is not
clickable I don't
know uh what is the
problem I'll just go from here you know
sometimes those links doesn't work so
let's see what is
iue one contains
and okay so we just to do that
the the limit part I have not given the
space so that is something which is not
acceptable by them just going to put
like skills like this
and now so these all small things you
know they
do take uh care of so here only because
we have come down so why not just to see
the extension here itself because that
would uh going to save our efforts by
going from outside so when you see the
ad you see some extensions here like you
know when you have created the ad right
now so you have created only till this
limit okay this is the elements you have
put it up right now the landing page the
headlines the description but in this ad
by emulators you can see more links like
apply to IM learn how industry so one is
landing page and three different uh
Pages or sub pages also been shown in
this same ad how they are done so they
are done through the extension called
site link okay so you can see here if
you go down after the headline there's
an option to have the site links here
okay so you can just click plus here
itself I'm not submitting the ad because
I wanted just to show you from here
itself and then you can go down because
in your case these would not be given
because mine are already created yours
are not so you would go down and you
would create the new new site link from
here and you can just give a name
suppose
download
brocher and then you can give a URL of
that download brocher page right now I'm
using this URL and I'm just going to be
adding my own made page like this like
this has to be the landing page which is
workable for the downloading brocher of
course so this would be be added and
then I can just go and probably add um
uh
testy um
monals and
reviews okay so somebody wants to read
the uh you know um testings and reviews
of when when they see the ad so you can
see that on the desktop how that would
look like so they would have an ad and
then they would have these four links
and all which you have just seen in the
Google when I shown you so final URL of
reviews can be given which would
directly take them to the page where the
reviews been given and uh site two could
be anything you know we can just see um
industry ready modules or the fee
structure you know the fee structure is
something which people always wants to
just
know from the uh very first glimpse of
the art itself so I can just
maybe take them to the page where fee is
actually been you know talked about and
the last could be uh maybe
tools
provided now tools
and
certificates you would get so that can
also be one of the links which people
would very much interested in you know
clicking and checking okay so you would
see the the ad in certain shape you
would have a normal headline uh the
description which you have puted up and
then four links where people can
directly reach okay okay and then you
know this had to be saved here and you
can always see the preview which I've
already shown you but yeah this is how
that would look like so you add your add
and your four uh extra links which
actually been added okay so this is one
which you can apply
now and now your ad has the extensions
in addition to that you might have seen
somewhere that you know your add as uh
the number as well sometimes you see the
number being given here
I right now it is not showing uh any of
the ads with the number but they you
know uh generally have advertisers have
nowadays the numbers in addition to the
headline and everything okay so you can
add that as well by just going up and
you can see there is an option of calls
okay okay let me you can add from here
uh certainly I can show you but you know
you can just go down and add the number
by clicking your country and you know
giving your number here it will just be
cross checked by some verification and
all so that is done you can save it so
you can see what actually I was showing
you you know I would just show you um
from outside also that if by any of the
uh you know um that is done that we have
corrected so you don't have to be you
know uh worried about so if I just click
done so that should not be there if it
is still there I have to check now which
spacing it is actually talking about
um actually I have unacceptable spacing
contains comma I think I have just
corrected it but it is not taking maybe
I have to just U um delete the whole
description probably that would
something which and I would save our
time okay so you're not adding the
description
though done so this is actually you know
kind of a bug because that is something
which has been deleted rather in front
of you so this is not
um taking but I would just click next
and probably this would now be not the
error in which we would see so you go
for a review so what I was saying I did
shown you from outside the you know the
the campaign was created from the ad
itself how the S site link is connected
and how the uh call being added for now
the publish campaign you can see because
that ad error actually been rectified so
if by mistake you know you just
forgotten that you have to add the call
number or extension you know which we
just added so what you don't have to be
worried because once you back to the
dashboard you know where you would see
all your campaign so certainly you would
see your this campaign as well in which
you had just created then you can just
go inside the um ad group and then you
can see there is ADD and assets let just
click that
so there's an ad which you just created
and there's an assets you know where you
could see uh
the extensions and all like you know you
just have added today and we just added
this site link and this number so if I
want to add again or if I would have
forgotten then what I can do I can just
go and take from here suppose if uh that
call extension was not added there you
know when I just added you would come
here in the assets you would click that
plus button and then you would just go
to the call and you would see the same
kind of a preview which you have seen
inside the ad when we were creating okay
nothing different it just like the you
know way you do it you know either you
do when the ad was created or otherwise
you can just go uh let the campaign be
created published and you can come from
outside you can click the add in assets
you can go to plus and you can create
any of these uh extensions we'll talk
about more in the coming you know
tutorials and demos uh and the sessions
but today you know we'll wind up here I
just uh you know wanted to give you the
thorough uh learning on the Google
search chart with the extensions and
also the main uh agenda for today was to
make you understand how these you know
terms works like and how the keywords
can be researched how you can bring your
own pricing to the keywords how you can
save the cost and of course to
understand how the quality score works
like you can have a lot of videos on a
YouTube where you can find the quality
score of Google ads working though I
tried to you know bring everything under
this session but still if you want to go
for a deep learning you can always
search more and research more what is
email marketing well email has been
around for a very long time of course
and in the very early days there wasn't
an email marketing service that you
could use yeah you couldn't easily send
out hundreds of emails so what you did
you were actually using the BCC or the
blind carbon copy in your email system
to send out emails to many people of
course the IT department of companies in
those early days they didn't like that
because it would block the email system
of the company so they come up with
little marketing uh email Marketing
Solutions on the company's main frame
but it was all very inflexible you had
to take your email you had to take your
mailing list give that to the guy in the
IT department and if you're lucky then
maybe in a couple of days later your
email would be sent you wouldn't get any
data at all about those emails yeah you
knew how many emails were sent but you
didn't know who would have opened the
email or who would have clicked on the
email nowadays of course things are
completely different yeah now you have
email marketing where you can use email
service providers who offer you lots of
tools and lots of analytics to manage
and plan and measure your email
marketing campaigns so what actually is
email marketing it uses email addresses
from people to inform your email list
about your product or service we call
these commercial emails which is
completely different of course from the
billions of personal emails that are
being sent yeah around the uh the
internet every day so this is a
commercial email that you send to an
email list about your product your
service or a newsletter and what have
you Additionally you can integrate it
into your marketing automation so you
can and it can help your customers to
see your latest products and offers and
you can obviously use the email list to
and persuade them to buy your book a
demo or sign up for a trial or register
for an event yeah we call this email
nurturing where you can send a range of
emails to take people through that
journey to help them to make the
decision so what are the different uses
of email marketing it can be used in
relationship building with existing
customers who bought the product for
instance s them a thank you email it
could be to boost brand awareness it
could be about promoting various pieces
of content it can help you in generating
leads or to promote or Market your
products and very important you can use
it to nurture leads so what are the
types of email marketing there are a
whole range of different emails that you
can send through email Marketing Systems
we'll talk about welcome emails
newsletter emails could be a lead
nurturing email a confirmation email
specific emails to specific people
invitations promotional emails or an
email to do a survey or seasonal
marketing emails so a whole r of emails
you have available that you can use for
different marketing purposes so now that
you understand the basics of email let's
talk about how you get started with it
it's not that complicated first of all
like with many marketing activities you
need to Define your audience and
establish your goals why do you want to
use email marketing and then you start
with one of the most important aspects
of your email marketing that is about
building your email list and that is the
most important it's a very important
aspect because if your email list is not
up to date yeah there will be a lot of
bounces on your email and your email
service provider may get back to you say
hey your email list is not up to date so
we may actually block you because you
may be spamming your customers you then
choose the uh the email campaign type
that you want to run you make a schedule
when you want to send out the emails and
then of course you need to measure your
results so as I said a very important
part is creating your email list and how
do you go about that there's lots of
ways that you can create emails the
simplest ways is when you are at an
event just put a little box at your
reception desk and ask people to leave
their business card and that gives you
already um a lot of emails that you can
enter in your email list database yeah
there's other ways you can take your
existing customer list and upload that
in the email system or you can use two
very powerful methods which is a lead
magnet and an opt-in form now what is a
lead magnet a lead magnet is a document
or a piece of content like an ebook a
white paper infographic or a report or a
checklist or a template or a webinar or
a tool and you put it on your website
you promote it through your email or you
have those documents available on your
website through your marketing campaign
you drive traffic to your website where
people will see the tech the checklist
or the template they will click on the
link and before they download they have
to enter their email address yep and
then that email address will will
automatically be added to your mailing
list yeah now how do you design an
effective lead magnet usually it's done
by creating a landing page and on that
landing page you have only one message
and that is the solution that you offer
or the piece of content that you offer
you make sure that the asset is simple
to use yeah that it helps you in
promoting your offer you can use it as a
Cornerstone to your paid solution so
maybe you promote a freebie that will
lead to a paid solution and you make
offers that are relevant for the phase
that the customer is in in the buying
process yep now the next form that we
talked about was the optin form an opin
form is a form that can pop up on your
website where people just need to fill
in their name address email contact
number Etc you can specify what Fields
you want to capture yep and again they
can do that to register for something or
if they have a question or if they want
to have a conversation with you opin
forms are important that you make sure
that the header stands out visually and
people will see it when they are uh
visiting your website yeah often you see
websites when as soon as you get to the
homepage that form will pop up yeah and
then make sure that once people have
seen the form and they they clicked it
way or they filled it in that they won't
see it again there's nothing more
annoying than every time you get to a
homepage that form pops up make sure
that relevant copy is there to encourage
readers to take advantage of the offer
keep the form easy yeah make sure you
have double confirmation enabled yep and
make sure everything flows smoothly on
your form so having gone through those
basics of email marketing what we're
going to do now is giving you a short
demo of
MailChimp one of the leading email
Services now what started off as a
simple email Marketing System yeah so
you put in your email addresses you
create an email campaign you link the
campaign to the email addresses yep and
then you send it out MailChimp would
take care of that and then MailChimp
would also give you the reporting now
this mail the these email Marketing
Systems they be became more and more
advanced they knew that digital
marketing is not only email marketing
there is no payperclick marketing there
is social media there is um what's it
influencer marketing there is
advertising you name it so they had to
enrich their
services and you will see that when we
go into MailChimp that there is now a
whole range of additional Services even
down to developing your own website that
MailChimp can offer you but at the core
of MailChimp is its email system so
let's go and have a look into how to use
MailChimp and how to set up your first
email campaign so if you go to
mailchimp.com
yeah you can see here a little overview
of what it does yeah then um again we're
going to go into automations I'm going
to show you some of the analytics I'm
going to show you how you can segment
with um with MailChimp and how you can
synchronize with other applications in
MailChimp as well so lots of stuff that
you can do here is a little promotional
video um and here is the pricing so you
can see that a free version gives you
limited functionality but it does give
you all the functionality you need to
send emails to up to 500 contacts per
month
yep and then it goes up to £170 and then
the premium version gives you all the
Full Features
$299 but let's focus on the free version
again that's what I kind of like of um
of MailChimp so let's go into my account
yes so I go on
[Music]
to let's have a look I'm logged in yeah
so here is
my
audience so here you see the features
that MailChimp has to
offer so first of all there is create
you can create
campaigns yeah that is where you run
your email campaigns and where you
create your marketing campaigns a very
important part of your MailChimp is your
contacts or your audience of course if
you don't have any emails in your
database as it were then yeah then
there's not many people that you can
send stuff to so contacts are very
important that you get an email list
that you can connect with your campaigns
there are alterations that you can do
which basically means you can send
emails automatically there is analytics
there is website you can create your own
website and modules of it there is
content so that is sort of your library
of assets and then there are different
Integrations that you can do here you
see kind of your dashboard of the
campaigns and this is your audience
dashboard so the very first thing of
course that you need to do when you are
starting on MailChimp that is create an
audience yeah and that's where you go in
to your contacts so there is your
audience dashboard as you see here you
can have all an overview of all your
contacts you can create signup forms
that you can add to your website to
capture people's email addresses there
are tags that you can set to content you
can group your contents into segments
and you can do surveys and there is your
inbox if people send you
messages yeah so lots of functionality
but your first challenge will be how to
get your emails there's lots of ways to
do that first of all there may be your
existing customer database or your
existing customer list you probably have
them in a
spreadsheet yeah so what I'm going to
show you in a minute is how you can
enter or um import that spreadsheet into
uh MailChimp yeah so that is one way
second you can actually set up on your
website a form that people can fill in
to sign up for your newsletter for
instance or you can run a campaign where
people go to a landing page and if they
download a certain piece of uh
documentation then they need to give you
their um their email address yeah so
there's lots of ways another really
effective way if you're at an exhibition
for instance have a little box on your
uh your counter where people can leave
their
their um their their business cards yeah
and then you can take all of that
information and put them in your uh your
MailChimp so the question here then is
of course how do I bring contacts into
my MailChimp audience so let's go to all
contacts yep and then you see I already
have two contacts in my myo
that's the name of my audience yeah so
I'm going to add additional contacts I
can get an overview of my contacts I can
add context manually I can add a
subscriber yeah and then I can just put
in the name yeah so that is Mark at uh
simply
learn.com and then it's
Mark there is simply learn don't have to
put in address
I can get phone number I can get
birthday I can get company name that
would be simply
learn I can add a tag so that would be
training add or create a
tag yeah that could be
training there's my tag now very
important what simp what what a
MailChimp wants to know that your people
that you have in your
database that you that they gave you
permission to email them yeah there are
very strict requirements these days for
people yeah that you need to respect
your privacy you need to have permission
before you send them an email yep and
there's different ways that you can ask
the permission you can ask it on the
website before they fill in a form you
can ask it in your newsletter yeah so
make sure that you have those
permissions because if people get
unsolicited email through a commercial
email campaign yeah in principle that is
not allowed and you may be subject to a
fine the you may have heard of the gdps
regulations in uh in in Europe and and
there is also regulations in the United
States there's regulations in Asia yeah
there's a real tightening of those
privacy regulations when it comes to
email marketing if this person for some
reason is already in my audience then I
can update it will update their profile
so let's click
subscribe let's
see there probably one field I
forgot phone number that is
07 yeah so the phone number was a
required um item as well yep and then I
click
subscribe so if I now go back to all
contacts you will see that Mark ATS
simply learn.com is now has been added
to my database so that is one uh way to
get emails in your audience list the
next way is if you go to add contacts
you can import contacts
there are three ways how you can import
contacts you can import contact from
another service yes so way you connect
with another piece of software you can
upload a CSV file or a text file and you
can even copy and
paste yeah so if I import from another
service you can see you can import for
sales force from Squarespace from
Shopify and there's probably a lot more
integration that you can have if you
want to upload a file it will then
basically ask you to upload your file so
what we need to do we need to create a
spreadsheet that we save as a CSV file
so if I go
to Google
Drive and I'm going to actually I
already have a file here yeah so so
let's open this file so you
see that I have these names in there I'm
going to take them out very important
that you add first name last name
company email and all the fields that
are relevant for you yeah so let's say
telephone as well so then we're going to
say the first name is uh
Jacob uh last name is Jones
company
is
bco and email is Jacob at jones.com
telephone number is 012 3 4 5 6
7 yep then the second name is um n
Marie uh
Carol and that is Carol
and that is n
murder at
carol.com and that is 9 87654 telephone
number okay let's take out that dollar
sign right yes so now I have the file
and this name is MailChimp or whatever
mail in
one so the first thing I'm going to do
of course is to save this I am going to
download this file as a comma separated
values file which is a CSV
file and MailChimp wants me to upload
this CSV file
into this field yeah so that's how I can
upload my context so I'm going to my uh
uh
YouTube downloads here is my MailChimp
CSV file yep so there it is I'm going to
continue to organize now the first thing
that MailChimp is going to do now if
there were any existing context they
will be updated the first thing I can
add a tag yes so I'm going to let's say
a member and I'm going to continue to
match that is what MailChimp is going to
do now remember the first line of our
spreadsheet was sort of the field names
first name last name company name and
telephone MailChimp is going to match
those MailChimp thinks that the first
line was first name the second name was
last name so these are correct company
it has picked up it doesn't know what to
do with telephone yeah so what I can do
I can edit this column yeah and I can
look at the field stand that they have
yes so is telephone in here I don't see
yeah here phone number yeah and I'm
going to link it with phone
number so now it is okay and I can now
see here five columns will be imported
and I'm going to say finalize
import yep so now it has added two
contacts to the list so I'm going to say
complete import
and if I now want to view my contacts
you will see that my contacts have been
added to my email
list yes so now I have two additional
contacts in my list I could also add a
subscriber actually have done a copy and
paste go back add contacts import
contacts I could do a copy and paste so
I'll show you how that works
continue yeah so when I go back to the
spreadsheet and I would copy these just
copy it command copy go back to my
MailChimp and I can now just paste them
here just like this and now MailChimp is
going to analyze this yeah and it says
okay this is what I think it is and it
goes back into that same stage that we
saw in um when we up when we imported
the
spreadsheet yeah you see here first name
last name company name and then the
telephone yep now I'm not going to
import this again because we've already
imported these contacts but this is how
you import your
contacts
okay now a few tips on your database
yes very
important you sure you want to exit this
okay yeah so you may build up a list of
a couple of hundred contacts in your um
in your MailChimp and that is fantastic
yeah the bigger your list the more value
that you will get from it a very
important aspect of this is to make sure
that your database is
clean yeah people may ask to be removed
from your database people change
businesses yeah make sure your database
is clean when you run a
campaign and you use your email list and
there are a lot of emails that cannot be
sent because there are a lot of wrong
emails in your list yeah you will have
what we call a high bounds rate and if
you have a continuous High bounds rate
mil chimp may come back to you and say
hey why do you have such a high bound
rate and if you can't explain why you
have a high bound rate MailChimp may
actually block your account because
MailChimp want you to work with a clean
database that is also the risk if you
buy an email list that you don't know
the source from and if you import it and
then run your fa first campaign it if
you get a whole lot of bounces on your
emails yeah then um MailChimp May block
your account so be very careful make
sure that your emails are correct that
your bounce rate is low and never
buy email lists because you don't know
what the quality is of the list make
sure that you segment your mailing list
and then you can within one mailing list
you can send it to your different
segments could be customers could be
prospects could be uh suppliers um or
what have you yeah constantly work on
growing your database make sure you
don't spam people always get um people's
um approval yeah that they are happy for
you to send them um emails and of course
honor unsubscribed as well if people ask
you to unsubscribe them from the mailing
list make sure you do
that okay just a few tips when it comes
to managing your database so now that
you have your email audience set up your
contacts set up let's look at a
campaign let's when you go into the
campaigns here you have an overview of
all the campaigns that you've run now we
haven't run any campaigns here is a
draft campaign campign yeah but what
you're going to do you're going to
create a
campaign yes when you click here on the
top right on the create campaign button
you have then the different types of
campaigns that you can or can create you
can do a regular email you can actually
create a landing page or you can also
create an embedded form yeah that helps
you in capturing cont context that could
be part of your landing page campaign
but what we're going to look at is
regular emails yeah so when I click on
email I can just sign click here design
email yeah then there is a new email
Builder that you can use and since
you're probably new to uh simply learn
um and new to um to milim
I click straight onto the new Builder
because that is a lot easier to work
with yeah so here you see it's time to
design your email yeah I put this little
icon already in yesterday yeah
so there's different ways of doing that
here you see sort of your editor for
your email here you can preview the
email here you see your editing building
blocks the L layout The Heading
paragraph button Etc here you can
specify Styles and here you can specify
templates for your emails so here you
see a whole range of email
templates yeah if you click on the
creative assistant that is beautiful but
it will drive you to a
premium account yeah so I'm not going to
show that I want to show you the free
features of MailChimp so let's say we're
going to go for a little design here
we're going to go for this one we could
do preview that's how it will look like
yeah and then we're going to click
apply continue with start with a clean
template yes so this is how it will look
like so what you can then do start
optimizing the text and the
images so let's do that so here VI this
email in your browser that is always
good to have you can change your image
yeah so if I click on
that yeah you see here replace logo yeah
so if I click on replace logo I can
then go to uh the content studio and I
can just upload different files here and

subject line of course is very important
in email marketing because in the
subject line people will when they read
the subject line people will decide
whether or not they will open the
email yeah so the subject line always
has to be catchy so and it could be five
reasons why you should read our
latest email uh

line but they are they need to be short
and sweet yeah you could use emojis you
need to in that one line you need to
give people the reason why they should

the inbox after the subject line yeah so

talk
about social media and email
marketing for instance and you click

your
content yep and then here is part of
your content you can send yourself a
test
email that is always useful to send it
to yourself and check it on your desktop
and check it on your mobile so I send
myself a test email send a test to any
email yeah so let me quickly check here
my
[Music]
Gmail that is
uh to
me that is tube for
Mark okay so I'm going to send that
email to Cube for Mark okay I can send
it to multiple people and I'm going to
click send test
email has been
sent so let's check the email so here we
see the email test five reasons why you
should read our latest
newsletter and then here you see the
email and then you check it on tyos you
check it on the links that are in there
yeah make sure that your social media
buttons work
etc and if you're then happy with your
email
you can then publish it yeah and there's
two ways of publishing it you can
schedule it when you schedule it you can
set a delivery date and a specific
delivery time but in order to use that
feature you need to upgrade to
premium okay so you can send it directly
so when you click Send it will go
straight away
yep so very important or you can say
finish later if you don't want to share
your campaign you see here the link for
the
campaign yeah and you could change that
your defiled campaign URL yeah so
MailChimp generate randomly five reasons
why you should read our email if you
upgrade to premium you can turn this
MailChimp into your uh own
URL okay good and then you can track
your uh your Campa your email campaigns
but um we'll put they we'll use we'll
cover that in a in a next video on on
mil chimp and we go into more advanced
features okay so I'm just going to click
finish
later and if we're now having our list
of campaigns then here you see we have
our MailChimp demo as a draft ready to
be published
so that is
the so that is the campaign how to
create a campaign on MailChimp right now
let's have a look at a few more things
so first of all a new feature in
MailChimp is the analytics when you send
out an email campaign you will get basic
analytics here in your um campaigns
dashboard as well but MailChimp now also
has an analytics
dashboard and here you see the type of
data that you will get in MailChimp and
it is using sample data so we can
explore the dashboard so here you see
number of emails sent whether it's up or
down you see the number of people or the
percentage of people that opened the
email and very important the actual
percentage of people that clicked on the
email or clicked on the link in the
email and that is very important yeah so
that's where you can really follow
through on your email campaigns yeah on
who opened it who clicked it to the form
thees that needed to be filled in so
very useful information that you can get
out of your campaign and you can see
that from various periods yeah you can
even actually in the other reports you
can actually see who are the people in
my uh mailing list in my audience who
actually clicked on the email and who
are the people who opened the uh clicked
on the link yeah and then you can
approach them
separately yeah so here you see
engagement
email sent and the click
rate yep so here you see by email the
the number of recipients the open rate
The Click rate the revenue that you made
if you had that set up so lots of data
that you can get on your email campaigns
open rates are very important and they
differ by industry yeah and general and
the open
rate anywhere between up to 15% and
higher are usually good open
rates okay so that is the analytics that
you can get and then finally what I
really like in MailChimp is that you can
use MailChimp to create landing pages so
if I'm going back to my
campaigns and I'm going to click create
campaign then I can also decide to
create a landing page page name of the
landing page is
myo select an audience MCO and I'm going
to click
begin yeah and here you
see a number of templates that I can use
for my landing
page yeah so very simple templates so
let's take this
template
accept I'm going into the
editor yeah so here is the editor for
the landing pages I can add text I can
do box text I can add dividers images I
can change the text yeah you see here
band mates yeah that is the logo I can
change the
logo yeah so I can replace the logo and
I can uh edit the logo and what have you
I'm going to stick with this text for
the time being and here is my email
address form yeah and the beauty about
it when people fill in their email
address in this form it will
automatically be added to my mailing
list in MailChimp so that is a very
powerful feature I can also create this
as a separate
form Okay so
so here you see the available fields
that I have email I can add first name
if I want to yeah I can add last name
and I can add phone number as
well yep I can then go to the
settings I can do the style different
styles that I can have so this is my
sign up form yeah the button text is
subscribe I can then also send visitors
to a confirmation message I can preview
the confirmation message success you've
been added to the
audience yeah exit
preview yep and that is my sign up form
and again it will automatically be added
to my campaign uh email list and I click
save and
close yep and here is the full
campaign yeah and when I'm happy with it
I can click save and
close so here is my l landing
page and it's now here I have the page
title and site icon here's the social
share preview here is the URL of my C my
landing page here is the
content and I can then get
my finish it later or I can publish it
and as soon as I publish it this URL
will be
live yeah so click publish
so this landing page is now live so if I
now go to this landing
page yeah so here you see email address
I'm
saying
uh
Cherry
oh Cherry at h.com
com and that is
Cherry H and I say
subscribe so now let's check the litmus
test if I go to my contacts and I'm
going to all my
contacts and here we have cherry hry the
famous Arenal football player who has
just joined my mailing list so that is
the part of MailChimp imagine it's the
year
2004 this is Phil Phil's looking to
release a book and set up a Blog he's
sure that it'd be successful but he's
only worried about one thing he doesn't
know how to ensure that his book reaches
the right target audience who could
enjoy his book during that period of
time however there were only a few forms
of advertisement available like print
ads Billboards radio Direct Mail direct
sales and the television all of these
options were pretty expensive their
effectiveness couldn't be accurately
determined and they didn't let him
advertise his content to the appropriate
audience PHS book would never find the
audience it deserved now let's have a
look at the same scenario in the present
day alongside traditional forms of
advertising Phil would have access to
digital marketing a form of marketing
that's a lot more lucrative inexpensive
and configurable marketing that would
enable marketers to advertise Their
audience digitally using channels like
search engines websites social media
platforms emails Etc among these types
social media marketing C Phil's eye
social media marketing would give Phil
the opportunity to take advantage of
social media platforms to advertise his
content to a highly targeted audience it
would help more people learn about his
book increase the interaction with his
audience it's relatively inexpensive
unless he goes into advertising and will
help him get Marketplace insights that
might help in understanding his audience
preferences better Phil started by
taking up a certification to learn about
social media marketing since he was
already familiar with the concept of
social media marketing his next step was
to learn about the different types of
content he could post on social media
some of the most common forms of content
that Phil could post would be images
text posts polls and videos but over
time Phil began to notice that not a lot
of people were being exposed to his
content Phil needed to advertise his
content for for that he would need to
use the advertising options provided by
the social media platforms like Facebook
Instagram YouTube LinkedIn and Twitter
most advertising platforms offer users
with a number of different options like
image ads these ads involve the use of
single or multiple images that are
attractive and have the optimal amount
of text they also have a call to action
that encourages user interaction Phil
could use images from his book advertise
websites that sell his book and more
then there are our text and post ads
these ads could advertise posts or
excerpts from Phil's blog or his book
further garnering interest from an
interesting audience he could also use
video ads Phil could use video ads that
feature favorable reviews and customer
testimonials to advertise his books Phil
could also use lead ads through which he
could collect information from users who
are interested in a Weekly Newsletter or
regular updates from his blog but that
wasn't the only thing Phil could do with
social media platforms he could create a
brand for himself and drive audience
interests to it engage with them create
an identity engage with content finding
content that works for him social media
platforms also allowed him the
opportunity to Target audiences based on
demographics like their age location
gender and much more and in time Phil
began to see an increase in the number
of viewers coming to his social media
page and by extension his blog he also
saw an increase in the number of people
who bought his book great increasing his
audience here are some things he learned
one to set goals that were quantitative
smart and follow a constant deadline two
to understand his audience by engaging
and connecting with them three to set up
a social media calendar to plan
competitions polls surveys videos and
more four using tools like buzz Sumo ift
buffer and more for lead generation
creating email lists setting buyer
personas and more
five to perform visual storytelling with
the help of images and videos but how
did Phil get so good at Social Media
Marketing before we find the answer to
that question let's have a look at a
quiz what can you do with social media
marketing a create a brand for yourself
B engage with an audience C Target users
based on demographics D all of the above
choose the right answer and have a
chance to win an Amazon voucher
now back to our question how did Phil
get so good at Social Media Marketing
Phil had taken up simply learns digital
marketing course it was thanks to this
course that Phil had the skills and
training to get good at social media
marketing and now you can too by
clicking on the top right corner and
with that we've given you an
introduction to all the major concepts
of social media marketing what social
media marketing actually means what is
it yeah and we got to put this in the
context of the definition of
marketing yeah I studied Marketing in
the very early days in the 80s and um my
main sort of uh Guru in marketing was
Philip Cotler and over the years
marketing has sort of developed from
traditional marketing to online
marketing but the basic concept has not
changed if you look at the definition of
marketing it's the activity of creating
communicating delivering and exchanging
offerings that have value for
customers yeah so you supply you deliver
you exchange products or services that
have a value for your
customers so two very important aspects
here there is value
and there is customer and that is what
we capture in the marketing concept you
put the customer at the core of what you
do yeah because when you do that you
automatically will look at what value
are we giving to the
customer yep so take social media
marketing in that context then the
second part of the social media
marketing sort of term is the word
social media what is social media when I
explain social media I'm using the three
C's the three C's of social media
marketing and they are content they're
community and
campaigns content is the fuel of your
social media content is the um the
currency of social media if you have
really good content
that you can share on the
internet yeah using various multip
multiple social media channels like
Facebook like YouTube or like video or
like Instagram or blogging you name it
yeah people will engage with your
content and then when people start
engaging with your content they may come
back for more contents that you supply
and they will then become part of your
community so Community is a very
important aspect of your social media
definition with really good content you
can create
communities and then you can push that
process by running
campaigns yeah and a campaign makes it
relevant for
businesses because when you run a
campaign you have a goal for your
campaign you have an objective you have
a St date you have an end
date yep and that is what social media
marketing is it's all about running
campaigns to develop your communities
with really exciting
content and then you put it into the
marketing context you do that with a
customer at in the core of what you
do yes so if I then take that to to a
definition of social media
marketing is very basic it says the use
of social media to develop a company's
brand increase website traffic and boost
sales that is what we call social media
marketing yeah the most important aspect
here is that you need to have an outcome
you need to have a result which is
customer
related and that is where the sales
element comes in you do this to get the
customer to do something and in the end
that is buying your product or your
service yeah so social media marketing
is not the
Tactical combination of your social
media networks yeah to um to reach as
many people there needs to be a goal to
it and when we talk about marketing it
comes down to selling your product or
service with a
value yeah so that is the um kind of the
call to action as it were that comes out
of your social media marketing so keep
that in mind everything you do with your
social media marketing in the end comes
down to reaching your goals or achieving
your objectives of developing your
company's brand increasing website
traffic or growing your
sales now a big benefit that you're
getting these days in digital marketing
and social media marketing is
data is
intelligence is
knowledge in the early days of marketing
the big problem has always been how to
measure the success of your marketing
campaigns if I ran adverts in a magazine
how do I measure the effectiveness if I
do a PR campaign and they write about me
in the newspaper how do I measure the
effectiveness of that how can I track
that when somebody buys a product it
actually is as a result of the pr
campaign that I ran
so in the early pre- interet days yeah
we the only way to
measure customer engagement as it were
were through Loyalty cards or credit
cards yeah with a loyalty card you had
some basic customer data through credit
cards you could track transactions but
it's very difficult to relate that to
your marketing then the internet emerged
and all of a sudden I could track
traffic to my website
yeah I could see how many people visit
my website are these people that visit
my website for the first time are they
returning visitors what are the most
popular pages that they see how long do
they stay on my website and are they
actually buying my
product yeah so that was a major
advancement of marketing in the early
2000s and then when social media emerged
it all of a sudden became possible to
measure
engagement how many people are having
conversations with us I could even
measure sentiments are people positive
about my brand are they negative about
my Brands I could track the
effectiveness of my marketing
campaigns I could measure the
effectiveness of my advertising
campaigns that I ran online so today's
reality is that we can measure
everything we can measure clicks we can
measure transactions we can measure
engagements we can measure return on
investments yeah and we can now even
take that a step further through
artificial intelligence that we can
actually start making predictions how
people may respond to campaigns that
we're going to be running now Having
learned about these sort of fundamentals
of social media marketing let's now have
a look at how do you put together your
social media marketing strategy how do
you set it up how do you develop it now
with my over 40 years of experience in
marketing digital marketing and social
media I developed a simple fstep
methodology to set your business or to
set up yourself for social media and
it's called flirt
yeah and flirt is an acronym flirt the
first letter the f is for
Focus yeah and in the focus phase what
you do you look at various things the
first thing you do in developing your
social media marketing strategy is look
at what is your
Niche what Market are you targeting
and the more you focus in your Market
your targeting your Niche the easier it
will be to reach
them yes so it's very important that you
focus on a very particular
Niche once you've identified that Niche
you look at your
positioning why should they buy from you
what is is your unique value proposition
remember the definition of marketing
yeah the value for your customer is key
in this and you put it in what we call a
positioning
statement you also look at your
customers you create customer
personas where you look at your
customers and you kind of map their
interests their uh pain points the
typical questions that they would ask so
you get a good understanding of your um
your
customers yes so you look at your Niche
you look at your positioning you look at
your focus or sorry you look at your
customers yep and then you're going to
ask yourself why am I going to use
social
media yeah am I going to use it to build
awareness am I going to use it to drive
traffic to my website am I going to use
it to generate
sales am I going to use it to improve
customer service am I going to use it to
recruit new staff am I going to use it
to communicate with my um my
employees yeah so lots of reasons why
you could use social media and it's your
challenge to identify one or two
objectives for for your social
media and then a very important aspect
of your social media marketing strategy
even your overall digital marketing
strategy what are the keywords that you
will be focusing on in other words what
are the keywords that you want to be
recogn recognized for Google wants to
know Facebook wants to know LinkedIn
wants to know and it's all about rep
repetition the more often you use those
keywords the more those social media
platforms and Google will associate you
with those keywords when people search
for them they will then show you higher
up in the search results we call this
search engine optimization or search
engine
marketing yeah so keywords is like a
whole course in itself but it's very
important part of your Social Med media
marketing strategy in the focus phase so
that is the F for Focus think about your
Niche your positioning who is your
customers why are you on social media
and what are your main
keywords the next is the L for
listen listen is so
important yeah we tend to talk too much
yeah where social
media can give you fantastic listening
opportunities and when I say listen I
mean read articles
online listen on Facebook and on Twitter
on LinkedIn listen on
Google yeah watch videos listen to
podcasts there's dozens of ways that you
can listen online because when you
listen you learn and when you learn you
get better and you develop so what does
that mean from you some practical tips
when it comes to listening first you
need to listen to where your customers
hang out are your customers on Facebook
are they on Twitter are they on LinkedIn
and later in this session when we go
through the various social media
platforms I'll give you an overview of
what type of people are on the various
social media
platforms the next thing that you want
to know when you listen is who are your
top 10 bloggers or influencers in your
Niche do you know your top 10 bloggers
do you know your top Instagram
influences because you want to learn
from them but you may also want to build
relation with them to use them in your
marketing
Outreach you also want to look at the
trends in your Niche Google Trends is a
really useful tool that you can check to
find out what are the trends in your
Niche and you're looking at your
competitors and your customers what are
they doing what are they talking
about yeah so a very important stage and
if you're doing it properly you would
actually set up a social media listening
dashboard where you bring all your
listening channels together in one
dashboard and then instead of having to
go to all those social media networks or
websites you let them come to you Ino
reader is a very good dashboard online
dashboard a free dashboard that you can
use for
this we're then looking at the I for
integration yeah so you know your Str
strategy you know where your customers
are you know which social media Networks
you're going to focus on then you're
going to integrate them you're going to
set up your social media Networks you're
going to make sure the branding and the
profiles are consistent you're using
your keywords you're going to create
your content calendar and you're going
to set up your blog blogging is very
important in social media marketing
because it is is the easiest way to
start creating content on your website
and to start sharing that content
through your social media channels that
will then drive people back to your
website yes so that is part of the
integration stage and then once you've
got that all set up you're then going to
reach out it's very important that you
reach out because if you're not reaching
out then people won't find you people
won't see you yeah the whole essence of
social media marketing is that you
create as many touch points as possible
on the internet for people to find you
yeah where they start engaging with your
content going back to your website want
to know more about you want to know more
about your content and you start
building a relationship that may then
turn into a sale so reaching out you're
going to start sharing your content
you're going to repurpose your content
so turn your blog post into a video or
into a carousel or turn your video into
a podcast or what have you yeah you're
going to share other people's content
there's nothing wrong with sharing
content from other people and you're
going to run
campaigns campaigns to push your content
in the
channels yeah and campaigns nowadays are
no longer sort of just posts on social
media it is a combination of
organic posts yeah where you just share
your posts on social media could be paid
like payperclick advertising or it could
be influencer marketing style um
reaching out yeah so very important is
the reaching out stage and then of
course tracking is the icing on the cake
as it were when you track you measure
your online reputation you measure your
conversions you measure your social
media activity and engagement you're
meshing your Roi and you plan for your
next
quarter okay time to talk about the
social media marketing platforms let's
have a look at some of the most relevant
ones out there now but before that let's
make sure that you understand the
essence of the social media marketing
platforms how do they work very simple
they all work according the same concept
what you do you create an account on the
social platform like Facebook for
instance you fill in your profile on
Facebook you put in a lot of data about
yourself on Twitter a little yeah so you
fill in your profile and once your
profile is ready you're going to connect
with friends or follow and be
followed there are some platforms when
you send somebody a connection request
or a friend request request when they
accept your mutually connected like
Facebook and like LinkedIn other
platforms like Twitter and like
Instagram when you follow somebody
doesn't mean that that person follows
you yeah so we're talking about
followers and following as it were yep
and then when you've got that you're
going to start sharing updates and
you're going to check your news feed
where you will see the updates from your
friends now as a business every platform
enables you to create a Facebook page or
to create a page yeah and what you want
to do you create your page you put in
your company information you brand it to
your company branding guidelines and
then you get people to follow or like
your Facebook page or your LinkedIn page
yep and then you start sharing updates
and people that like your page they may
see your company updates in their
feeds and this is what we call organic
reach so you do a post as a business and
then the people that follow you will see
your posts on their person personal news
feed now in the early days of social
media this organic reach could be 40 to
50% which means that if you have
10,000 followers on Facebook so 10,000
people liked your Facebook page 5,000 of
those people would see your update on
their personal news feed which is
fantastic and that was in the early days
for social media many Brands they spent
lots of marketing building huge
communities because it was a fantastic
free way of reaching out to your
Market nowadays things have
changed Facebook has been driving this
yeah Facebook wants you to advertise on
Facebook all these social media and
platforms they have to make money so
they have advertising sort of on their
platform
and they want you to use advertising so
over the years Facebook has lowered
organic reach to less than
3% so again if you have 10,000 people
that like your Facebook page fewer than
300 people may see your updates in their
feet and Facebook says hey that's the
way it is we offer you a fantastic
marketing environment and we need to
make money as well so hey yeah St start
advertise on Facebook to reach your
entire audience and businesses Now
understand that they now know that
social media is pay to playay to reach
your audience it's no longer relying on
organic reach you have to pay to use
payperclick advertising or PPC but we're
going to talk about that in the next
videos all right so it's very important
that you understand this concept of how
social media marketing platforms work so
let's start with the first one the
biggest one Facebook with 1.9 billion
active users
worldwide fact is that over the years
the younger generation has left
Facebook yeah why have they left
Facebook because it's not cool anymore
yeah and their parents are on it yeah so
if you want to reach the young teens ear
late teens early 20s don't go to
Facebook you want to be on social
networks like Snapchat or Tik Tok if
that's available in your market now
there's still markets where Facebook is
enormous yes so they are the leading
social media Network in your Market if
that is the case then of course you have
to be on Facebook but in General we can
say that the audience for Facebook is
now a slightly older audience Generation
X or Millennials it's still a really
good Network to reach these people
particularly when you talk about
consumer type products now what does
Facebook offer you as a business to use
Facebook has the Facebook page that you
can create to reach your audience
nowadays Facebook really would like you
to use Facebook
groups Facebook groups is a fantastic
area in Facebook where you can get
really good
engagement and as a business you can
offer a group to your customers as a VIP
area or a product knowledge area or a
pre-launch area or just for your
customers yeah lots of reason of areas
where you can use a group to reach your
customers then there's Facebook
Messenger of course that you can use for
your business where you can set up Bots
yeah so you can have sort of automated
conversations with your customers on
Facebook messenger and there is Facebook
live don't ignore Facebook live Facebook
loves you to use Facebook live the
beauty about using the Facebook live it
gives you sort of Buzz and engagement
before the event during the event and
after the
event yeah we call this tent pole
marketing you can build up excitement
leading up to the event and after the
event as
well and then finally of course Facebook
is betting heavily on the metaphors yes
so it's Mark zuber's Vision that instead
of engaging with your friends in the
news feed you engage with in a virtual
world now the verdict is out if this is
going to work but fact is that although
we've been talking about virtual and
augmented reality for years it is here
now yeah there's more and more apps
becoming available on your mobile on
your desktop that use augmented
reality and virtual reality I can now
download Ikea place I think it's called
where you just open up the app you pick
a product from the catalog like a table
and then you can just position that
table in your living
room yeah and then you can move it
change the color of it or whatever yeah
using augmented reality through your um
your
camera okay so that is Facebook let's
look at the next one Instagram I love
Instagram yeah a lot of users from
Facebook have gone to Instagram
why because it is a visual social media
platform and it has inherently higher
engagement than Facebook it's easier to
reach the audience not just your
friends yeah so lots of cool features in
Instagram one of the coolest features is
the Instagram
stories yep and people now spend more
time on the stories than on the uh the
timeline where they see the posts so
Instagram started as a photo sharing app
very simple yeah you made a photo you
put a filter on top of it which almost
felt like you're a photographer and then
you share it with hashtags and you saw
immediately the likes coming in and
people loved it for its Simplicity and
now it has grown to a fully featured
social media Network that businesses can
use to make their brand come to life via
photos and Via
Stories the audience is slightly younger
than the Facebook um audience but a more
and more mature audience is coming on
there as well and it's it initially it
had very much a business to Consumer
Focus but nowadays it's not just photos
that you can share you can share visuals
I can turn a blog post into a carousel
of five
visuals yep and um in that way share
really good
content so very powerful and very useful
for businesses to reach the audience
that hangs out on on
Instagram all right so that is Instagram
let's look at the next one and that is
YouTube now YouTube of course is not
just for watching video YouTube is a
fantastic social media platform to build
an audience of
followers yeah it's a great platform to
monetize your video as well by enabling
advertising to be shown before or during
your videos a lot of video creators they
do that yeah and YouTube has a program
for that if you qualify by by um number
of views that you have on your video and
number of uh and and the size of your
audience you can participate in this
program and it is a really good way to
make money on you for many content
creators now check out our earlier check
out our earlier video on how to create a
YouTube channel to find out how you can
set up a YouTube channel and how you can
use YouTube as a social media platform
YouTube is great for brand awareness and
since it's owned by Google it's also
really helpful for your search rankings
both on YouTube and on Google Google and
there's lots of different videos of
course that you can make yeah videos
that do well are typical videos like
howto videos unpacking videos Vlogs
video blogs we call them review video
videos live videos lots and lots of ways
to reach the video your audience yeah on
um with video on YouTube so the typical
audience that uses YouTube are basically
everybody from young to old but very
important to understand with YouTube
that people are there for a reason they
search for something they may search for
entertainment they may also search for
answers to their questions which is
different than the videos you would have
on uh Facebook for instance yeah so
Facebook is very good for brand
awareness where YouTube videos are very
good for um for lead generation for
instance and for building relationship
with your your
audience good a very interesting so
social media platform that emerged
around 10 years ago is
Snapchat they have around 300 plus
million daily active
users and let me tell you a bit about
the history of Snapchat Snapchat was a
response to Facebook's problems about 10
years ago in
privacy and um not being
anymore and particularly the Privacy
issue where in those days a lot of
people said who is owning my photos on
uh on Facebook yeah um is it Facebook or
is it myself so a lot of people and that
there's always been a gray area yeah
combined with Facebook not being cool
anymore and you know how important being
cool is for the younger
generation yep so fa so two guys who
came up with the idea of doing something
radically different and they came up
with a social media platform Snapchat
where posts would delete themselves
within 24
hours they built a a user interface
around this which was fairly difficult
to use yeah but that was for a
reason kids they love to explain to each
other how it works and if it's
complicated enough then their parents
won't be able to get on it yeah so kids
love that idea it's too complicated to
use for my parents so I really have my
own social media world yeah in Snapchat
that nobody else has access to so
particularly the teens the Generation Z
yeah was very uh keen and they were very
hot on the uh on on Snapchat so it was
the new place for Facebook users to go
to and they grew ever since steadily not
huge but they are there and they are a
very powerful social network
particularly when you want to Target the
younger generation now there are two
major features that they sort of drove
into social media land which was the
stories and
the vertical videos so you all know the
concept of the story it self deletes in
24 hours but it turned um social media
instead of sort of scrolling through
your news feed you swipe from story to
story much more visual much more fun
much more
engaging yep and you would swipe those
stories vertically and that
automatically led to us using vertical
video and vertical video is a major
Trend in social media content yeah which
is picked up by um by Tik Tok as the
main format for uh for videos on Tik Tok
YouTube have shorts so all social media
now networks they now have stories and
they have vertical video as a key
element yeah so vertical video
particularly for short 10 12 second
videos which we call snackable content
is very important why would you tilt
your phone to watch a video why not just
use it vertical which is also a quite an
interesting um sort of form factor to
get a good engagement on your
videos finally Snapchat has very
Innovative advertising
features yeah they have lenses they have
stor they have filters you can put a
filter over your face BMW had a really
good campaign to launch a new car where
you could place the car through a lens
anywhere that you liked in augmented
reality and you could actually put a
filter where you gave yourself a golden
face yeah so very powerful advertising I
think the the WhatsApp advertising
platforms is one of the best advertising
platforms out there it's also probably
one of the most expensive um advertising
platforms of all social media
networks right so let's look at Twitter
I call Twitter SMS on
steroids yeah it was one of the first
besides Facebook one of the first social
media platforms that came out and it was
a very exciting platform when it
launched and Twitter relied heavily on C
celebrities using it to drive acceptance
on a global scale yeah and many music
stars rock stars actors they started
using Twitter and that drove the global
adoption of the uh the platform now what
makes Twitter so powerful there are
three aspects on Twitter first of all
you can retweet a tweet yeah so when you
send a tweet and I follow you I receive
your Tweet if I just click on retweet
it'll go to all my followers yeah if
somebody in my follower base retweets
that tweet your Tweet can go viral
without uh in in in in minutes Y and
there's various examples of tweets that
went viral um within minutes yeah like
the um which was it a selfie tweet
during the Oscar ceremony a few years
ago yes so it is um so the retweeting is
very powerful
it also makes it instant yeah because of
this retweeting aspect news goes on in
on Twitter instantly and it shares to a
global audience instantly so that makes
it very very powerful for news agencies
as well and for businesses a very
powerful feature of Twitter is the
Twitter search each tweet is indexed and
you can
search in all the tweets you can search
for the very first tweet that was ever
sent yeah so that makes it very powerful
for Brands to find content so Twitter is
really good for finding jobs for
instance because lots of businesses they
tweet about I'm looking for a marketing
manager or a web developer so if I
search for webdeveloper # jobs that
tweet will show up in my search
results one problem that Twitter had is
that they did not keep up with the
developments in social media platform
functionality yeah so most celebrities
went to Instagram because Instagram was
much more visual much better place for
celebrities to engage with their U their
fans so Twitter lagged behind and in the
last few years it clearly repositioned
itself so so it now is seen as a great
way for businesses to use as a
communication and service Channel with
their customers and for media companies
to share the latest news so if you want
to find out what is happening in the
world now or what businesses are doing
now or if you have a problem with a
product from a business Twitter is the
best place to be and for you individual
as I always say you don't need to be on
Twitter to tweet but you must be on
Twitter to find great content to
search whether you want to search for
jobs or whether you searching for
opportunities if you're a photographer
yeah and you in London for instance and
you go to Twitter and you search for
looking for wedding photographer London
you get a list of tweets of people who
are tweeting I'm looking for a wedding
photographer does anybody know
anybody yeah so extremely powerful to uh
to use for lead
generation right so what about Pinterest
pinest is a visual bookmarking
platform it's very cool the concept is
simple you see a photo on the website
that you like yeah what you can then do
you can pin that photo on Pinterest in a
board yeah and you're not copying the
photo you're just copying the link in
your board so by doing that you can
build fantastic collections of visuals
that you like and want to
organize so I bought a house in Marakesh
a number of years ago in Morocco and we
needed to design the interior so we had
a board with Morocco design we had a
board with Morocco riads we had a board
with um tying and what have you and we
just build up a whole collection of
ideas that we liked and then we got the
people that helped us in making the
things that we wanted and we could just
share them the links on Pinterest of the
ideas that we had worked really
well now because you can save those
Boards of course you can then share them
as well yeah so everybody can access
your boards which means that it becomes
a great tool for getting ideas and
Inspirations from boards from other
people so if you want ideas for home
design or your wedding or fashion
Pinterest is a fantastic place to get
inspiration another major benefit for
businesses is that you can put your
product catalog on Pinterest as visuals
organized in boards yep and then when
people find those products on in on
Pinterest and they click on them it will
take them to the catalog of your website
where they can buy your product so it's
a great way to drive additional traffic
to your website if you want to see a
good example for that go to the Ika UK
um Pinterest page and look at their
boards you see boards for small living
room ideas back to school Christmas
holiday celebrations and then you get
lots of ideas with um for instance for
small living rooms and then you click on
some of the products that you see and
that takes you to the page on the Ikea
catalog website where you can buy the
product now Pinterest is very popular
amongst women amongst Millennials and
and it also has very powerful
advertising
features and then LinkedIn LinkedIn is
serious yeah I call LinkedIn Facebook
with a tie where Facebook is fun
LinkedIn is serious in Facebook you can
get away with a funny profile photo in
LinkedIn your photo needs to be
professional now if you go to
linkedin.com
sales SL
SSI you get your Social selling index
and that is a score between one and 100
of how good you are on LinkedIn and you
will see in the score in the summary
that are four components that contribute
to your SSI score or four components
that contribute to how well you do on
LinkedIn so those four are your profile
yeah your activity level in connecting
with
people how much content you share and
your activity level in building
relationships with
people yeah so the better you do in
those four areas the higher your score
your profile of course is very important
make sure that your LinkedIn profile is
as complete as possible now linkedin's
biggest challenge as I mentioned earlier
is to get people to engage and share
content so how does LinkedIn make money
very simple there are four areas where
they make money first of all they allow
people to upgrade their LinkedIn account
to a premium account where they get more
features there is a whole section in
LinkedIn specifically for
recruiters yeah so a recruiting version
of LinkedIn there is a whole area for
sales we call this sales
Navigator yeah if you run a sales team
that use LinkedIn of course you want to
keep the customer data so you're getting
a sort of customer relationship
management system within LinkedIn when
you sign up for sales Navigator and then
there is LinkedIn
advertising LinkedIn of course is best
for business to business and it's really
good for developing your personal online
profile as long as you share content
through publishing articles and sharing
uh sharing posts so I've been
operational on LinkedIn from the very
beginning and I shared lots and lots of
content and articles on LinkedIn and I
got lots of business coming in through
Linkedin yeah we're talking about
serious amounts ofs business that I did
by being on LinkedIn so you got to be on
LinkedIn if you are in
business right now one thing that I will
not talk about here is is Tik Tok yeah
we haven't got a slide for that but bear
in mind Tik Tok although it's not
available in India um Tik Tok is a very
important social media Network these
days which drives a whole new format of
uh of of engaging and communication but
more about that that
later now let's go into the social media
marketing tips and
tricks number one set up your
goals now what good will your actions do
if you don't have a goal in mind the
goal of your marketing strategy may be
the driving force behind every decision
that you make and this is exactly why
setting up goals goal is very important
moreover your marketing efforts have to
align with the goals of the
organization here are some things that
you need to keep in mind while setting
up your goals first of all your goals
need to be quantitative for example you
need to have a th conversions by the end
of the quarter or 5,000 followers on
Instagram by the end of the month and so
on number two you need to stick to a
consistent deadline this gives weight
for each of your options and number
three make sure your goals are smart now
smart refers to specific measurable
attainable relevant and
time-based now let's go to number four
like I mentioned earlier your goals need
to be aligned with the marketing
strategy and alongside these goals there
also needs to be the Northstar metric
now what is the Northstar metric well
this represents a main goal or a fixed
refence reference point to ensure that
your team is on the right course this
Northstar metric will also give your
team Clarity and
focus now let's have a look at some
popular northstars there's increased
engagement greater conversion rates more
leads generated app downloads and so on
now let's go to number two understanding
your
audience social media allows you to
interact engage and build relationships
with your Audience by understanding what
they need want and desire you can
deliver content in a way that makes your
product or service the answer that
they're looking
for there are also other ways that you
can understand them better this could be
surveys to determine the issues that
bother them the age demographics of
Their audience by conversing with them
in forums responding to their comments
and blogs and social media taking up
their feedback of suggestions into
consideration and acting on them and so
on now here's an example of different
channels and the audiences that use them
now here well we've taken a personal
example here is simply learn now simply
learns audience is predominantly working
professionals and graduates an academy
has high school graduates and BYU app
has high school students as
users now let's go to number three
determining the right social media
platform now when performing social
media marketing choosing the right
platform is really
important When selecting them you need
to ask questions like why you're using
that particular platform who you will
reach with this platform what content
could work best on the platform and is
there any content that was unique to
that platform like for example YouTube
and then there's the
video answering these questions will
help you zero in on a platform for you
now while there are several platforms
available for you to choose from let me
tell you about some of the major ones
there's LinkedIn Facebook Instagram and
Pinterest now let's talk about the
purpose of each of these platforms
LinkedIn is a professional Network

news or entertainment usually finds
success on Facebook and then we have

Doesn't Really drive a lot of traffic to

static images however it's highly
effective at driving traffic to your
blog

the message you want to convey to your
audience it also consists of information

opportunities for engagement with the
audience and they can be used to

predefined hashtag and competitions help
grow your presence on social media then
we have polls and surveys polls can help
you if you need a collection that also
encourages followers to take action and
interact polls and surveys also provide
opportunities through which you can
learn from customers to understand what
they like about the product or service
or what they don't and to receive their
feedback and then we have videos and
live streams although we'll be covering

trying to get the attention of the
million of prospects out there in the

sure that when they are in the buying
mode that you are there to help them
it's a new economy out there it's a
service driven economy look at products
like Uber or um Airbnb where a whole new
ecosystem has developed of people
offering their products their services
to a global audience in marketing terms
we're using a term called solomo
standing for social local and
mobile yeah when you bring those three
elements together of social media local
marketing and mobile marketing you stand
a really good chance to connect with
your customers at the right time Google
has um summarize this in what we call
Google moments on average people have a
couple of hundred moments during a day
where they grab their mobile phone to do
a search on their mobile phone they
maybe want to buy something they want to
book something they want to share
something they want to learn something
all those little moments are
opportunities for you to connect with
your your customer or your prospect and
that's your opportunity but that's also
your challenge to make sure that you are
there when your customers are having
those moments when they scream I want
your products and there are plenty of
channels that you can use to reach those
customers yeah we know about social
media we know about your website there's

email marketing and there's more and
more competition out there that are
trying to use those channels to reach
your audience but fact is there is one
channel that really stands out of all
these channels and that is payperclick
advertising payperclick advertising is a
well established part of what we call
the digital marketing
Trifecta and this Trifecta consists as
the word Tri say of three components
owned paid and earned yes so the owned
is your own website are your own social
media profiles and your social media
pages but owned is no longer enough you
need to supplement your owned media with
paid media and this is what we call
payperclick
advertising and then the third element
of the digital marketing Trifecta is
what we call earned media and earned
media is where you can still use the
powerful um effects of public relations
in an online world or where you can work
with influencers yeah to help you
develop your online presence and connect
with your
audiences but one of the best ways to
start getting to your audiences is to
use
advertising yeah and there are various
platforms for advertising there is um
Google yeah there is Google search
advertising Google display advertising
and there is Facebook advertising now to
put these two in the context Google did
about $210 billion of Revenue in
advertising in
20121 Facebook is about half of that $15
billion do in
2021 and the most powerful models for
advertising are search ads and display
ads yeah so a search ads is in the
Google search which is what
Google offers the display ads and video
ads are offered by Google and by
Facebook and we call this payperclick
advertising which means you're not
paying for showing your ad but you're
paying when people click on your
ad okay so let's have a look between or
to this advertising in a bit more detail
yeah Facebook advertising was introduced
on around
2007 yeah so um in 2007 it was launched
by Facebook yep so but it has grown Dr
ically since then in
2011 ads were being shown in the news

sponsored stories in 2012 ads came on
the mobile yeah mobile ads are now
considered the most powerful um forms of
paperclick advertising in
2014 Facebook introduced a thre level
advertising structure which was very
much introduced by Google as well where
you have campaigns you have ad sets and
you have your ads and when you go in
setup and you'll see that later your fa
your ads in Facebook you will have to go
through these three ad elements yeah
campaigns ad sets and ads to set up your
advertising on Facebook in 2 in 26 sorry
in 2016 Facebook introduced chatbots and
ads in messenger which became a whole
new area for advertising for Facebook
yeah connecting with um customers on
Facebook messenger and offering that for
advertising as well and in 2018 there
was a whole range of AD formats
available on Facebook from videos
stories messenger Carousel slideshows
collections so a whole range of ads to
choose from when you start your face
setting up your Facebook ads now what is
the future yeah what does the future
hold for Facebook
advertising as you may have read um that
both Facebook and Google are having a
lower Revenue in their advertising given
the whole world economic uh situation
we're slowly moving towards a a
recession even yeah Facebook and Google
and Microsoft all the big Tech players
are are feeling the impact in that yes
so that is one Element now one of the
other reasons why Facebook's Revenue has
gone down in advertising is the tracking
uh
capabilities and um a lot of businesses
they track people when they visit their
website and then you can Target them
with ads we call this retargeting in
marketing terms now Apple has announced
um earlier this year that on iOS people
can say which is on the iPhone people
can decide to not being tracked yep so
that has put a whole sort of kind of a
um a a a um a uh a
different set of um Dynamics in Facebook
advertising on the iPhone and it is not
as effective as it was before that
announcement from um from Apple so the
future of advertising is all about
security it's about privacy and of
course in the end it all comes down to
how good are your ads how what is the
quality of the content in your ads are
you able to stand out from the crowd
yeah so those are the big challenges in
Facebook advertising now you have to be
aware that Facebook advertising is
completely different than Google search
advertising yeah to put it into a
context Google search advertising is
what we call intent based yes so when I
have a question or I'm looking for
something or I need a plumber I go to
Google Search yeah and I search for
plumber near me and Google will give me
some ads with plumber near me that is
not the way Facebook advertising Works
Facebook advertising yeah is not intent
based it is basically it is your
challenge when you advertise on Facebook
is to stop the user from browsing and
click on your ads so it's more
interruptive you need to make sure that
they stop what they're doing which is
much more difficult yeah so you'll see
that face Facebook is therefore slightly
more challenging to actually generate
leads yeah to get new
customers Google advertising is much
better for that but Facebook advertising
is much better to reach a global
audience very targeted yeah and work on
awareness developing your proposition
helping your prospects to go through the
buying cycle
yeah so Facebook ads they help spread
product and brand awareness in the news
feed or on Instagram or on messenger to
a very specific targeted
audience now another element which is
important to understand when it comes to
Facebook advertising is to do with
Organic reach when I have a Facebook
post and I do uh sorry when I have a
Facebook page and I do a post on my page
the people that will like my that have
liked my page will see my post on their
news feed that's how the
theory is yeah of course not everybody
will see those posts because that
wouldn't work because then you would get
way too much advertising in your feet
yeah so Facebook is very selective in
the number of post posts from
advertising from businesses or sorry
yeah from businesses that will show on
your news
feed yeah and in fact that percentage of
people that will see your post your
business post on their personal news
feed is less than
3% so again if you have a Facebook page
let's say with 10,000 followers and you
do a post on your Facebook page less
than 300 people will see your
post now businesses are not happy with
that yeah they said hey Facebook why are
you doing that I want to reach my entire
audience and Facebook says well hey you
you still can yeah but it's going to
cost you some money and Facebook says
you have to go and advertise on Facebook
to reach your audiences so businesses
Now understand that Facebook is what we
call pay to play you to reach your
audiences you have
to supplement your organic reach with
advertising and the beauty about
Facebook advertising is that it is a
fantastic way to reach your target
audience and that is the biggest benefit
that Facebook advertising can give you
it's all about the targeting there is so
many targeting options in Facebook and
I'll show you when we go into the short
demo on how to set up your ads so what
are the reasons why businesses go into
Facebook yeah what are the reasons what
are the benefits that they will get from
it and the first big benefit that they
get is that they get access to an
audience which is out there yeah and it
is not just a small audience we're
talking about Facebook at as of today as
close to three billion active monthly
users that is a massive numbers and most
of these people they check their
profiles at least once daily so it is a
huge audience to reach and there is no
better social media Network to reach a
global audience than on Facebook yeah so
that is one of the reasons why you want
to start advertising on Facebook the
second reason one why you want to start
advertising on Facebook is that Facebook
gives you a fantastic platform to
advertise your products to People based
on their demographics based on their
interests based on their location based
on their um their history of browsing
based on so many different segmentation
factors which means
that you can make sure that your ads
reach the Right audience which is a
really good benefit that you will get
from Facebook
advertising the next benefit that you
get from Facebook advertising it is that
it is very cost
effective yeah you can just start with a
small budget you can slowly inrease your
budget you can relate your B budget to
the returns that you're getting from it
so it helps you spend less and achieve
more it is one of the advertising
platforms with the highest return on
investment of your um on your money so
very coste effective to advertise on
Facebook here are some other reasons why
businesses use advertising on Facebook
it really helps them with increasing
brand awareness I said earlier the
difference with Google search
advertising Facebook is not intent based
people are not searching in Facebook
looking for Content which could include
your ads they are actually browsing on
Facebook and it is your challenge yeah
to um to be creative enough to make them
stop browsing and pay uh attention to
your ads so it really helps in
increasing brand awareness it's let it's
an opportunity for you to Showcase your
brand and to help them add value to
their lives so by doing that you
establish trust you establish
credibility yeah and you provide recall
value for your brand so it is all about
taking the customer by the hand and
helping them in going through the buying
cycle yeah so when the buying cycle is
about awareness is about building
interest yeah then building that trust
that they then will turn into buying
your
product the second big benefit that
you're getting from Facebook is to
Target people that have already
expressed an interest in your service we
call this retargeting
you may also have heard about pixel
targeting or pixel marketing it
basically means that if somebody visits
your
website yeah you can then retarget those
people with an
ad from a technical ele as a perspective
it means that you need to put Facebook
will give you a piece of code that you
need to put on your website and then as
soon as some somebody visits that
website that triggers that code it
automatically connects with Facebook and
then Facebook will capture that user
data that you can then use to Target
them with a specific
ad so a big opportunity there for the
retargeting but things will be changing
here in the near future yeah Google has
announced that by 2023 24 it will stop
an abling third parties to leave cookies
on the um on on on website it sites yeah
to Target people so that whole
retargeting area will go and will
undergo some big changes in the near
future and then of course Facebook
advertising can really help you increase
Revenue as I said earlier it is a
fantastic way to to connect with people
and take them by the hand through the
buying cycle you can educate your
audiences about what your product has to
offer yeah and the more people know
about your product the more likely they
are prepared to make a purchase and to
share their
experiences so lots of benefits that you
get now let's dive a bit deeper into
this and let's look at the different
type of ads that Facebook has available
so first there is the single image ad
these are single ads single image ads
that have an option uh optional text on
the top and a link description that
links to your website and a call to
action that is very important to have a
good call to action in your ad the ad
images they need to be 1,200 by 628
pixels so that's where you have an
opportunity individual to stand out in
the news feed and make people stop and
then click on the link as you see here
for instance sign
up the next ads are the
multiproduct ads they are usually
carousels so it enables you allow
consumers to see all the products or the
services that you have available they're
very efficient they're very um Visual
and they have lots of creative options
um in them so they're very popular and
they're Lots being being used lot by uh
by businesses so that's your
multiproduct ads usually via a
carousel then of course you have your
video
ads Now video ads are 30 second to two
minute ads and they are amongst
Facebook's most engaging most popular
ads they get about 10 to 30% more views
than other ads and not only views also
and engagement why because people love
to engage with video when you engage
with video you have the opportunity to
touch emotions of people which is much
stronger in building trust building
relationships with your
audience and particularly video on
mobile yeah works really well so it's a
high growth area of video advertising
and one area that you definitely need to
look at if you want to be successful
with Facebook
advertising then you have the lead ads
lead ads they offer a slightly different
way to advertise your products they let
you get usernames emails phone numbers
actually without leaving
Facebook yeah and that's what makes them
really powerful within Facebook
advertising you can actually create a
sign up form or you could even drive
them through Messenger and have a
communication with them to get their
details through a
chatbot so people don't leave Facebook
you do the whole process of lead
generation and lead capture within
Facebook and it can be easily
synchronized with your existing CRM
system and then you have collection ads
collection ads blend video and product
catalog photos so they um are really
good if you want to advertise multiple
products at once yeah if you want to do
this so collection ads work really
well okay so that's a short introduction
of Facebook advertising the benefits
that you get why people would use them
why businesses would use them and the
different type of ads so in the next
section let's go and have a look at how
do you create an ad what are the steps
to create a Facebook
ad so here you see I am on a Facebook
page and this is the page for Riad
farasha which is a um a hotel u in
Marakesh and I am the admin for this
page and what I'm going to show you on
this page is how to access the
advertising platform and how to set up
your ads yeah so let me first before I
do this show you what Facebook is trying
to do everywhere whether it's your
desktop or your mobile to make sure that
you go into advertise creation mode yeah
so you'll see it everywhere
promote ad Center create ads create all
automated ads boost post wherever you
are you will come to sections like boost
post or go please create an ad on the
mobile it's even more obvious yeah here
is the same page but then on the mobile
device and if I scroll down you see on
the first post immediately boost the
post so you'll see that Facebook is
trying everything to get you to
advertise yeah and I think it is a bit
annoying yeah but it's also you need to
be aware that all the various places
that Facebook will try to to hook you
into advertising they lead to various
subsections of the advertising platform
yeah so if I click here on Boost the
post it will take me to a what I call a
quick and dirty boost uh advertising
module yeah so I say I'm going to good
morning from our rooftop I'm going to
turn that post into an ad yeah and I can
immediately decide what goal do I want
for my ad do I want to add a button what
is the URL yeah do I want to edit the
image who is my
audience yeah and then what is the
budget what is the duration where am I
going to show these and how am I going
to pay bang bang bang boost post
now yeah so it looks very interesting
and very effective to do this but what
you see here is you will only get a
subsection of what Facebook advertising
can do for you yeah and if you think hey
if that's okay with you that's fine but
you're missing 90% of the other features
to to make your ad as effective as
possible in other words my advice to you
would be don't click on the Boost post
button on your mobile yeah or your
desktop because again it leads you to a
limited functionality of the advertising
module and the advertising capabilities
that Facebook can offer you so back to
the desktop
the same applies here if I click here on
Boost
Post Yeah there's nothing wrong with
advertising for a post you can take one
of your most successful posts or for a
video and you can create additional
reach for that post through advertising
but don't do it through the limited
advertising functionality again this is
a quick and dirty module everything on
one page and it will um you can click
boost post now and it's an easy way to
start spending your money yeah so that
is if you click the Boost post the same
applies if you go to
the create ads or create automated ads
yeah so let me show you the create
automated ads it takes you through a
very automated process of creating ads
which is great when you're a beginner
but again it will only give you limited
functionality of what Facebook
advertising has to offer you so again my
advice would be don't go to the
automated ads click on create ads that
again gives you limited functionality
gives it all in one page again you don't
want to do
that yep and then you click on the ad
Center that gives you again a summary of
the advertising slightly more
tools yeah but it's all to lure you into
spend money in a very quick way so then
where do I go for my
advertising the place where you go is to
the Facebook or how do you know called
meta The Meta business Suite The Meta
business Suite gives you everything you
need for your advertising it allows you
to manage multiple advertising
accounts yep and it gives you access to
the full functionality of what Facebook
has to offer you so let's go there The
Meta business
Suite so here you
see everything you need for your
advertising yes so here you see it's
your read for Russia and it's not only
for your
advertising you can manage your posts
here you can schedule your posts manage
your inbox your notification manage your
content manage your shop plan your post
now we'll cover all these areas in
future videos but for now we want to
focus on the
advertising again even here they have
ads as a quick and dirty method to
create your ads again where I want you
to go click here on all tools and now
finally this is where you want to go it
gives you access to the full advertising
functionality to create your ads to
manage your ads to manage your audiences
to set up events when you want to
connect get get data from your website
and where you can create your form
this is where you want to go yeah so if
I click here on the ads
manager that takes me to the full
advertising
platform now here you see by the way
turn off ad blocker yeah which is
important
because in your creation of your ads
Facebook will obviously
simulate your uh your ads yeah but if
you have your ad blocker on the ads will
not show in the preview so it is
important that you switch off the ads
blocker so you create your browser
environment exactly as users will have
in um when they they see your ads so let
me go into switching that off which is
is more tools
extensions and you see here my ad
blocker is on so I'm going to switch
that
off yeah let me do a
review yeah so here you have your
account overview you have your uh your
dash your sort of your dashboard now you
see I haven't run any campaigns yeah so
I'm not going to so there's not much to
see here in this um this this tool so
let's go here under my
campaigns yeah and this gives me the
basic sort of structure of your
advertising on Facebook yeah remember we
talked about campaigns ad sets and
ads yeah those are the three
elements of
your advertising campaign on Facebook
you create a campaign and I'll show you
what you need to set up in the campaigns
then within a campaign you can have
multiple adets and those adets within a
campaign inherit the settings of the
campaign and then within adets you have
ads yep and Those ads they inherit the
settings of the adsets and the settings
of the
campaign all right so you see here we
have three or two campaigns or three
campaigns there is a new leads campaign
there is a page likes and there is a
traffic campaign so now I'm not going to
show you these campaigns I'm actually
going to show you how to create a
campaign so let's go into that here is
create if you have experience with
advertising in payperclick advertising
you will recognize this approach Google
ads has it as well it is what we call gu
Ed campaign
creation yeah so when you start your
Facebook ads and when you start your
Google ads you can select do you want an
awareness campaign do you want a traffic
engagement leads promote your apps or a
sales campaign yeah and basically once
the the campaign objective that you
select
will set a number of the settings yeah
sort of specific Al for that campaign
objective so it makes it easier to align
it with your business goals and the
whole setup will be done easier yes so
here you see an awareness objective so
that is to good for reach for brand
awareness for video views yes so it's
showing the ad to the to as many people
as possible who are likely to remember
them traffic is to send people to a
destination like your website this is
really good to get link clicks to get
views on a landing page or get people
get into conversations with people on
Messenger or Whatsapp engagement ads is
get more messages videos views post
engagements is good for Instagram for
messaging apps good for video views
engagement on posts lead ads are collect
leads for your business or brand they're
good for instant forms on messenger good
for conversions and to get calls here is
to promote your apps like in app
installs app events and here is sales
that is for your catalog sales for
instance yeah we're going to do a simple
one I'm going to set up a traffic I want
to drive people to a landing page yeah
so here I'm going to click on traffic
yeah and I'm going to click
continue so now I'm going into the
campaign cign settings so here you see
the three structures again the new
traffic campaign new traffic adet New
traffic ads that I'm going to
use okay so here is my traffic campaign
I'm going to create a name which is I'm
going to stick with new traffic campaign
am I going to use any AD are there any
AD categories yes so is it about
elections is it about politics is it
about employment about social issues
yeah remember a few years ago there was
this Scandal when there was brexit and
the Trump elections or the in
2018 I believe it was there was a lot of
data being sold by this Cambridge
analytica that they data they took from
Facebook and they sold that to the
campaign teams of the US election and of
the brexit yeah that had a big impact on
privacy on Facebook and on um
advertising for for elections and
politics so and now Facebook has set
some extra sort of security guidelines
for specific ad
categories now what are the campaign
details here you see by default it is
set as an auction paperclick works on an
auction base and this is not a paper
click course but basically it means you
will do a bit on your ad how much you're
prepar prepare to pay for a click yeah
and that will then go into an auction
and that will determine the position of
your ad we want to get more
traffic do you want to do ab testing yes
and we want Facebook to do that yeah or
you switch that off and what is your
budget do you want to create distribute
your budet across add sets yeah if you
want to do that you can switch that on
and then you have your campaign budget
so we're going to set a daily budget
of2 yes so go back to
the F setting yeah and then what is your
campaign bit strategy I just want the
highest volume and there's more options
you can schedule your ads so you can set
it at specific times my advice is to run
the ads all the time yeah particularly
in the learning phase when Facebook
launches your camp campaign it goes into
learning mode and then Facebook will see
by itself when your audience will um uh
will um will respond and they will
adjust the ad scheduling accordingly so
there is your traffic
campaign details then we're going to
your traffic ad set where do you want to
drive your traffic to your website to an
app to messenger we want to drive it to
the
website now Dynamic creative is an
important one yeah do you want to want
Facebook to create your ads or do you
want to do it yourself when you want
Facebook to do it you provide creative
elements like images and headlines and
then Facebook will automatically
generate the best ads for you yeah so I
kind of like that yeah so I always
switch that on on here you see the
schedule when do you want to start yes
so do you want to send an end as well so
that would be then let's say November
the
22nd and then here is some more options
you can set at spend limits and here is
where the real
meaty sort of stuff happens in Facebook
advertising this is where you can select
your audience you can save specific
audiences in the audience manager yeah
so you can have a number of audience if
you have an office in one country or
another country you can just here select
select the audience for that particular
country or you can just create a new
audience okay so you can exclude
audiences you can set a location you can
set the age location let's look at that
if I click here on edit people people
living in or recently in this location
people living people recently people
traveling in this location so this is
really powerful if you want to Target
people who are visiting a an event like
a football match or what have you and
you can include and this is where you
can search location you can search by
City let's say
London yeah so London England or I can
say let's do for instance reading in
England yeah and I can even say uh give
me yeah so I can search location give me
uh
rg7 I can do by post code yeah so I can
actually people doing in the reading
area by postcode and I really like this
so if I say for instance RG
76 yeah so here you can see how you can
talk Market a specific area yeah and
this is particularly for your local
marketing is very
important yep so that is the uh the
local targeting is really good so you
can and then by the way here you see
your estimated audience size and when
your audience get bigger you see
estimated daily results as well and then
you can do more you can search by um
where was the is you can search by
detailed targeting by demographics by
interests and behaviors yes so if I want
to people who like
Reading Football Club yeah so here is
the reading FC soccer team yeah so here
are I can now sent an ad targeting
specifically people in that particular
area who and we have the UK as well yeah
so uh in reading and that particular
area who like football who like Reading
Football Club yeah or I can um at other
areas as well there's also the
suggestions if people like reading they
may also like these type of things nyar
soccer or maybe they like Manchester
United yeah so this is just a tip of the
iceberg the whole segmentation in
Facebook advertising and the targeting
is extremely
powerful okay here are your placements
for your Facebook ads best is to let
Facebook decide where to place your ads
but to show you where your ads can be
shown on Facebook if you click on the
manual placements you see here they can
show on Facebook they can show on
Instagram on messenger and on the
Audience Network now what is the
Audience Network Google has that as well
yeah in the display ads which are ads
that show on millions of websites that
Facebook has an agree or that Google or
in this case Facebook has an agreement
with so it shows your Facebook ad
outside Facebook on millions of websites
okay so that's the Audience Network then
if you look at the here's the feeds
where your ad can sh can show your ads
can show in stories and
reals your ad can show instream
videos overlay and post Loop ads on
reals on Facebook search on messaging in
article apps andite so there is tons of
places where your ads can show but the
best thing is to let Facebook decide
where your ads are going to show okay so
these are your ad set settings so let's
now look at the
ad so here you see the Facebook page and
in our case it is the riat
[Music]
Faria
page there you go yeah we'll make it you
can opt in for Branded content tools you
can look at the ad setup we can do men
manual upload you can get data from your
product catalog and here you specify
what type of AD you want to show is it a
single image or a video or is it a
carousel yep and then here you have your
add
creative and your media and then select
images select videos and then here you
have your primary text headline
description your website URL
this is where you can do your url
parameters when you want to track your
campaigns yeah here you see the ad
preview at preview is off and now it's
on yeah but of course I need to select
media so let's
see find images so here we're going to
say go to my
website and create an image for me
approve yeah so now it will actually
show me some
images select images yeah so here you
see images from my
rat yeah that it picks up from my riat
or from my website here's the website
yeah so let's take uh
let's take this image and we'll say
continue yeah
so select a destination link for your ad
let me see where we're going to put that
one
there you go yes so now because I put in
the destination link you will see how
the ad start building but this is the
photo that I selected yeah now I'm not
going to show you the details of and I'm
not going to use as an example here I
just want you to show you the fields
where you can play and create your ads
yeah and then you see here in the
preview whether you see it in the feeds
there is a mobile preview as well yep so
you see here the feeds you see here the
stories and the reals how they would
look on Instagram the
instream yep and here in the search in
article and on
apps yes so there you have it that is
your traffic ad so we've now done our
campaign we've done our ad set we've
done our traffic ads and then basically
what you're going to do is you're going
to publish your
ads now when you're going into
publish yeah you can then go back to
view the
details and then you see that the ad is
um done and it is actually in review by
Facebook so if I now go back to my
campaigns yeah let's close this one
you see here is the new traffic ad yeah
and you see here it's processing and
then here you see immediately the
details that you can get from your
campaign yes so you see the processing
you see the ad set name the bit strategy
the budget you see attribution setting
so basically attribution is how you
track the results of your
ads um and then you see here results in
number of Link clicks how many people
reached how many Impressions what is the
cost per result what is the quality
ranking the engagement ranking the
conversion ranking the higher these
rankings the better Facebook considers
your ads and the more and the better the
positions for your ads here you see your
amount spent and here you see the end
date of the
campaign yes so that is how how you set
up your Facebook ads as a kind of
introduction to the Facebook
advertising yeah so if I now go back to
all my
campaigns campaigns yeah so you see here
let me see if I have some no you see
there's no none of these ads actually
run or did run in the past yeah so I
can't show you the the results but we'll
go into more details at a later um the
later session on uh on Facebook
advertising for now this is I think the
best overview I can give you yeah and um
if you want to get more than details
then we'll go in a more in-depth session
of uh the Facebook
advertising okay now that is all clear
let's look at the dos and don'ts of
Facebook
advertising what should you do and what
shouldn't you do with your
ads so there are various dos the first
of all make sure you continuously test
your
ads and the good thing is that Facebook
will do this for you yeah you can tell
Facebook please test my ads you can give
Facebook a collection of creative
materials a collection of headlines yeah
and it will actually mix and match those
those headlines and it will use the ones
that will give the best um the best
conversions so it's very important that
you continuously look yeah at your
performance and see if minor changes to
your ads will lead to a better
performance second make sure that your
images and that your videos are engaging
remember there is no int
in Facebook advertising you have to be
very creative to stand out from the
crowd and you can only do that by making
your ads engagement or then by making
your ads
engaging in images and
videos so the not only the images or the
videos but it's also the messaging that
you use use a message that will stay
with your audience
yeah so it's the combination of the
visuals and the key message of your ad
that will make people stop if by looking
in a split second at your ad yeah they
get it then they will stop and they
will click on the call to action so make
sure you use a message that
is powerful and
effective also keep it simple what we
say kiss keep it simple and stupid make
sure that people easily understand the
message that you're trying to convey
with your ad don't make it too
complicated don't use complicated
visuals don't use complicated messages
keep it
simple and make sure that you reach the
Right audience yeah Facebook's biggest
benefit is the targeting you can Target
micro on micro level targeting people in
very specific
areas yeah so that is the dos and of
course there are don'ts as well so the
first thing is be sensible with your
budget don't spend your whole Budget on
one single campaign yeah so start small
and basically grow your budget based on
the results that you're getting
yeah if you have to use visuals and
messages that are um appealing then of
course don't make sure that you po put
too much information in the ads again
keep your ads simple don't clutter them
with too much text and too many
visuals make sure that you proofread
your ads don't have typos in your ads
there's not a lot of text in your ads so
please make sure that you double check
the quality of the ads when it comes to
the language and the um uh the kremmer
yeah so don't forget to proofread your
ads be sensible in the activity level
that you have on your Facebook page yeah
up until a few years ago it was it was
actually promoted by Facebook to do as
many posts as you think are relevant for
your business people did four or five
posts a day nowadays it is not about the
quantity it is about the quality so
don't do too many posts on your Facebook
page be sensible think from a customer
perspective also when it comes to your
ads yeah so too many ads or showing the
same ad to the same people all the time
you may have an adverse result and then
finally make sure that your image
relates to your product so don't put up
an image that doesn't relate to the
advertised product is literally content
marketing um okay what is it so content
marketing Is Not A New Concept it's been
around for over a hundred years in fact
one of the classic Foundation stories of
you know the birth of content marketing
goes all the way back to the Michelin
Brothers in France and the Michelin
Brothers you know in case you haven't
done your history that's okay you know
little refresher right now were two
brothers who made pneumatic tires and
they were trying to sell them along with
an Innovative product at its time called
the
automobile in an era where the roads
were horrible in a place France where
frankly people didn't like to get
outside of Paris and into the provinces
because my gu what was worth going out
there for you know reparis it's all
happening here and what the Michelin
Brothers realized is if they wanted to
sell more
tires they had to get people to drive
farther and farther and use them so what
did they come up with the concept that
really is the birth of content Marketing
in my
book was the Michelin
guide and the Michelin guide was unique
in that it reviewed restaurants not just
restaurants nearby in Paris but
restaurants out there in the
provinces and the Michelin brothers are
the ones who came up with the one two
and three star rating system to say this
restaurant I know it's way out there
it's you know bad roads uh but guess
what to dive for the Ratatouille oh you
you got to have it this is a three star
restaurant you you it's worth making the
trip
and oh by the way and since we're going
to give you a guide and you have to get
out of Paris in order to get there we're
going to tell you where you can find
gasoline along the way uh which hotels
uh you might want to stay at overnight
and oh by the way just in case you have
to how to repair a flat tire
particularly if it's a Michelin tire
because it's a Pneumatic and you know
what it's quite easy to
repair and guess what that put Michelin
on the app why they weren't trying to
sell you more tires they weren't telling
you about the features and benefits of
round or a tire repair I mean that was
in there but it was only a how-to
article not necessarily a feature and
benefit what they were doing was they
were speaking to Their audience about
what Their audience was truly passionate
about which in Paris in
1900 was
food and by creating content
but got the audience to get into their
new Innovative
automobile and drive all the way out
there into the provinces for that
absolutely remarkable three star
restaurant people got more Flats people
had to replace their tires but it was
worth it and oh by the
way Michelin sold more tires so that
that's a great story every time you sort
of you know hit a pause and like well
we're doing content marketing and we
need to come up with a concept think
back to the Michelin guide it's it's a
great
foundation so let's go to a modern
definition where are we now in the 21st
century when it comes to content
marketing well you can read the slide
here and read the definition and some
people like reading definitions I'm not
going to read it to you but I am going
to highlight a couple of words in the
definition that I think are
absolutely critical to any definition of
content
marketing the content that you create
needs to be
relevant and it also has to be
valuable now if it's not relevant then
you're not actually meeting my needs or
interests you know and why would I be
interested in them and we've gotten way
too tired of screening out the
commercial that comes on um you know
trying to sell us snow tires and pardon
me we live in Florida I don't use snow
tires what the what the heck is this
commercial doing you know interrupting
what I'm
watching so relevance is important
relevance means that this content isn't
going to get screened out and the
valuable the valuable can can work in a
lot of different ways it could be
interesting it can be useful you know
value is an interesting proposition all
by itself
itself but that's the key to content
marketing uh it's not just creating more
spam it's not just throwing more trash
over the fence and hoping something
happens this is something where if
you've created valuable and relevant
content you know what your customers
will find you it's a whole different
kind of
proposition I know there's some Skeptics
who saying oh come on come on come on
content marketing is just a fancy news
name for social media marketing right
and the answer is well there is some
overlap and we're going to deal with
that in module
three but let me just be clear
here social media content is part of
what content marketing needs to create
but it can also create content for your
website and that's not the social media
it can also create content that U your
PR people can share with uh uh reporters
or bloggers and that's not normally
considered uh social media content and
by the way all of that content can be
optimized so maybe it actually is part
of SEO not social media marketing in
fact that's the other place that content
marketing really
overlaps and it's not
coincidental it so happens that around
February
2011 when Google rolled out the first of
its multiple versions of the panda
update all of a sudden even seos started
to pay attention to content marketing
why because Google changed the rules and
what Google basically said is if your
content isn't valuable or relevant you
know what it's not going to rank very
well in our search
algorithm and all of a sudden people who
had been used to like putting keywords
in the right places realized kind
content matters you mean I've got to
actually tell stories that are
interesting I've got to create
information that's
valuable yeah yeah you can make it
relevant that's the optimization part
but you know if you're trying to
optimize a piece of boring irrelevant
trash God bless you good luck so yeah
content marketing has grown it's like
tripled in terms of web search interest
since the panda update and we're talking
about Panda 1 of course there was Panda
2 Panda 3 Panda 4 I mean come on Google
is driving us in this direction and so
content marketing is pretty relevant
today now one of the other things that
uh people in content marketing struggle
with is oh but you don't understand I do
B2B content marketing or I'm a small
business or pardon me I'm an Enterprise
and so content marketing has to come in
flavors right well possibly
maybe on occasion so let's just question
that assumption for a
second you know content marketing has
been around now long enough and enough
people have done it but some research
has been conducted and it's been
conducted against B Toc marketers and
B2B marketers and small business
marketers and Enterprise level
marketers and when they start asking key
questions like okay we're going to try
to determine what is the difference
between an effective content marketer
and an ineffective content
marketer let's see the results well
first of all the most important thing to
Be an Effective B Toc content
marketer is you need a documented
content
strategy oh okay all right mean people
who are winging it aren't as uh
effective as people who actually have
thought about this and written it down
got it okay no great Insight but you
know interesting to note secondly they
got to have somebody in charge who
oversees content marketing oh Lord does
that mean we have to have a reorg or
maybe we just have to designate somebody
who reports to somebody else whatever
but guess what it really helps if
somebody is driving this
process third they've got to be using
more content marketing tactics than
their less effective
peers and this is not an argument more
is better this is just pardon me that's
the way the data falls out the people
who are actually more effective are
doing more different kinds of
things a broader range of
tactics and who knows maybe it's that
broader range that's part of the success
formula same thing is true with social
media platforms
the effective content marketers are
using more than the ineffective ones and
last but not least and this may be a
sort of a result of the first four by
gosh effective content marketers
generally have greater
percentage of the overall marketing
budget in their
organization wow okay that's the b2c
marketing form but you don't understand
I'm not a b2c market marketer yeah yeah
yeah yeah okay so let's take a look at
the B2B content marketing
formula guess what you need to have a
documented content marketing strategy to
Be an Effective B2B content marketer you
need to have someone who oversees
content marketing strategy it helps if
you are using more tactics and more
social media platforms and guess what
you spend a higher percentage of your
overall marketing budget
on content marketing well that's similar
to the b2c content marketers but do you
understand B2B is different yeah there's
a couple small differences but guess
what overall the top five criteria are
similar and when you get to small
business here's what you're going to see
same five
criteria and you're in an Enterprise I
know the world is different for
Enterprises actually not so much so four
different data points let's net it out
there's a pattern and the pattern is is
I don't care what flavor of content
marketer you are you can be b2c B2B you
can be small business you can be large
Enterprise at the end of the day there
are five things that you've got to focus
on if you want to be
effective we've already covered these
and are there differences between small
businesses and large Enterprises between
B2B and B Toc well
sure but they're all at the
margin what's the downside if we don't
do this you know is anyone going to come
in and like wakas and the answer is um
maybe not inside your boardroom but it
may happen on the next sales call that
one of your salespeople makes they may
encounter someone I like to call the man
in the chair and the Man in the chair
actually refers back to a classic McGraw
Hill ad campaign from I think the
1960s but basically the guy in the chair
asks theoretically some questions from
quote maybe your salesperson okay I
don't know anything about you I don't
know about your company I don't know
about your company's product I don't
know about your company's you know
reputation or anything about you and so
what was it you were going to try to
sell me and that's the downside of not
having a content marketing
program content marketing has been
around for over a hundred years but in
the online World customers are behaving
in lots of new ways and they're
consuming content on various kinds and
types of devices and that changes things
content marketing is now about creating
content that consumers will engage with
and act upon not just read or listen to
or watch
so in this introductory module we're
going to provide you with an
understanding of how content marketing
affects the decision making process when
people are on the customer journey to
making a purchase and with a solid
content marketing strategy your
customers's buying decisions can
actually uh happen faster you can
basically uh shorten the decision making
process and you can reach and expand um
to new prospects so one of the things
that we hope that you're going to uh
learn after uh basically taking this
module uh you should be able to do the
following first of all you can Define
content marketing and other related
Concepts secondly you should be able to
explain why content needs to be relevant
and valuable in order for it to be
effective third
you need to describe uh the overlap
between content marketing SEO social
media
marketing fourth you need to name five
traits of effective content
marketers and last but not least you
need to explain the benefits of content
marketing these are our objectives and
hopefully they're going to be your
learning
outcomes so content marketing Is Not A
New Concept it's been around for over a
100 years in fact one of the classic
Foundation stories of you know the birth
of content marketing goes all the way
back to the Michelin Brothers in France
and the Michelin Brothers you know in
case you haven't done your history
that's okay you know little refresher
right now were two brothers who made
pneumatic tires and they were trying to
sell them along with an Innovative
product at its time called the
automobile in an era where the roads
were horrible in a place France where
frankly people didn't like to get

it's you know bad roads uh but guess
what to dive for the Ratatouille H you
you got to have it this is a three star
restaurant you you it's worth making the

to give you a guide and you have to get
out of Paris in order to get there we're
going to tell you where you can find
gasoline along the way uh which hotels
uh you might want to stay at overnight
and oh by the way just in case you have
to how to repair a flat tire
particularly if it's a Michelin tire
because it's a Pneumatic and you know
what it's quite easy to

on the map why they weren't trying to

about what Their audience was truly

into their new Innovative
automobile and drive all the way out
there into the provinces for that
absolutely remarkable three star
restaurant people got more Flats people
had to replace their tires but it was
worth it and oh by the
way Michelin solds more tires so that
that's a great story every time you sort
of you know welcome everyone this is Rob
Sanders from Simply learn and today
we're going to talk about affiliate
marketing so let's jump right into it
and take a look inside an office
environment right now we have Chuck here
Chuck's doing a little bit of pacing
John walks in the office hey man what's
with all the pacing everything all right
Chuck responded hey I'm just worried
that I might have exhausted every way we
can advertise our product I mean I've
done SEO I've done Page search I've done
email I've done social man nothing's
working I got to come up with something
new ASAP well John responds hey don't
worry I think I've got your solution for
you man hang tight relax take a load off
here's my solution affiliate mark
marketing first off before you ask the
question what's affiliate marketing
let's talk about why we need affiliate
marketing so let's dig into affiliate
marketing so John's just taking over now
and he's going to let Chuck know
everything there is to know about
affiliate marketing so the first
question John answers for Chuck what is
affiliate marketing so affiliate
marketing is a form of digital marketing
that involves a merchant it involves a
merchant paying commissions to a website
or other entities so if I'm selling a
product basically somebody else sells
that product for me I'm going to pay
that person a commission for selling my
product it's that simple that's what
affiliate marketing is okay so basically
what these Merchants are doing or other
entities they're advertising your
product so they're advertising your
product with a referral so they're
passing on their own customers to you so
that they can buy your product product
and again The Exchange is you give that
website or other entity a commission
that's more or less what affiliate
marketing is so John's going to have us
take a look at each of these components
of affiliate marketing in detail take it
away John so John says first we have the
merchant AKA The Brand the seller the
Creator the founder the owner the
inspiration the innovator hey this is
the person who came up with this
brilliant idea This brilliant idea has
to get out there we're the merchant
we're trying to get this brilliant idea
out to the masses so this is the
component of affiliate marketing that
creates the product the merchant could
be anyone okay so it could be startups
to large multinational companies
International companies nonprofits
for-profits individuals independent
contractors Freelancers a group of
people who have a passion for something
okay it could be anybody there's no
limit the affiliate aka the publisher so
the affiliate is basically that
thirdparty website or entity which
promotes the Merchant's products and
tries to convince potential customers of
the merchants products value so this
affiliate is going to represent the
merchant on their behalf and try and get
their clients to basically purchase that
particular Merchant's product so the
affiliate could be incentivized based on
you know registrations email sign up
sales and subscription so it doesn't
always come down to you know sales you
know if I'm just trying to get you know
build my email list then hey I can
incentivize that affiliate to push email
signups if I'm got this big you know
offline you know promotion that I'm
doing at this particular mall and I want
to get people there well I can get an
affiliate and incentivize that affiliate
to drive and help me drive registrations
for this event so it doesn't always have
to be sales per se so in effect you the
merchant and the affiliate work out some
type of commission deal based on what
you're incentivizing so the relationship
between the affiliate and the merchant
is made possible with the help of an
affiliate Network so that's the third
component here we need somebody to bring
the two together that Merchant who has
This brilliant idea and the affiliate
who has potential customers that could
potentially Drive registrations sales
signups Etc to the merchant so the
affiliate network is the one who brings
the two together so the affiliate
Network in effect acts as the middleman
the person in between the merchants and
Affiliates it allows Merchants to find
and collaborate with not just any
affiliate but the affiliate best suited
for their particular brand and product
because you want to find somebody who is
going to be passionate who's relevant
who has your prospective customers in
mind because they're the ones that are
going to help those protective customers
purchase your product so that's what the
affiliate network does it helps bring
the merchants and Affiliates together so
that the affiliate can help advertise
and sell on behalf of the merchant so
with the affiliate Network Merchants can
use tools for tracking and Reporting and
processing payments for Affiliates so
really that affiliate network is the
glue that holds it all together they're
not just one to introduce a merchant and
affiliate they offer it all so as a
merchant you want to be able to manage
your Affiliates so you're not going to
have one affiliate you're going to have
multiple Affiliates so you want to be
able to use the appropriate tools
available to you in the affiliate
Network to see and track how sales are
going and when sales happen okay or
commissions happen you want to be able
to use that affiliate Network to
compensate that affiliate appropriately
and then finally the customer customer
aka the consumer is the most important
compon component of all of this take it
away John so the consumer is the final
and most important component without
customers to buy products the merchant
would not have any revenue and the
affiliate would not get any commission
so we need customers hello everyone and
welcome to this Google analytics full
course video by simply learn today we
will understand Google analytics which
is the best analytical tool provided by
Google to check up on our website we
will understand how Google analytics
Works how we can use it to measure the
performance of our website we'll also
understand how to set up goals and
create events that will help us keep our
website on track next we will look at
Google tag manager and towards the end
we will unlock the mystery of how to
rank at number one position on Google
it's not that hard as you think it is we
have Rob with us who has more than 15
years of experience in digital marketing
and analytics and he will take us
through these topics over to you rob
welcome everyone this is Rob Sanders
with simply learn and today we're going
to talk about Google analytics I'm very
excited to be with you today because
Google analytics is one of my favorite
Google platforms and my favorite topics
so let's talk about what we're going to
cover today and we're going to start out
with how to set up a Google analytics
account and so we're going to talk about
everything that entails including
creating your Google analytics account
we're going to talk about setting up a
property in your account and what a
property is we're going to talk about
setting up a reporting view in your
property and we're going to talk about
installing the tracking code so those
are the series of steps we're going to
go through today in terms of setting up
a Google analytics account so let's get
right to it and so really the bru
prerequisite here when it comes to
setting up a Google analytics account is
to have a Google login and ID so when
you actually go to Google analytics you
need to be able to sign up or sign in
and so once you actually sign in then
you're going to go walk through a series
of steps but really that's really all
you need to get the account going is a
Google ID and login so if you have a
Gmail account or other email account
that you use for other Google products
then you're good to go that's all you
need to do so when you actually go to
sign up for Google analytics you're
going to be as to set up a new account
and these are the series of steps you're
going to walk through or go through to
set up a new Google Analytics account so
you're going to choose an account name
and then you're going to choose a
property name okay so the account name
can be anything you want it to be the
name of your company your name whatever
you want to name it the property name is
is really the website name so what
website are we talking about so here I'm
going to set up a fictitious website
name for now it's called demo simply
learn so the URL for this website demo
simplylearn is going to be demo dos
simply learn.com so that's the property
when we talk about properties and
analytics we're really talking about
what websites we want to measure and
then you're going to be asked to choose
an industry category and so for simply
learn we're in jobs in education but you
have a number of different industries
that you could choose from this is
important go ahead and choose the most
relevant industry that your particular
business is associated with okay and I'm
going to talk about why that's important
here in a minute and then you're going
to choose your time zone and the time
zone is also important because that's
when the day starts in analytics and the
day ends based on that time zone so the
data that Google analytics collects
starts and ends ends with that time zone
so very important to choose the time
zone your business is located in okay
and then you have some additional
options here okay so you have some
settings and so the first setting is to
allow Google products and services so if
you opt into this then basically what
Google's going to do is share some
products and services with you via email
I would go ahead and opt into that
that's of course recommended by Google
it doesn't hurt to hear from Google on
related products and services that may
enhance your business the second is
benchmarking so benchmarking to me is
something you should opt into so going
back to that industry and category we
chose jobs and education so by opting
into benchmarking basically what
Google's going to do is share your data
that it collects on your website in this
case demo. simplylearn
anonymously with others in the industry
in this case jobs and education and
because you've opted in it's going to do
the same exact thing for you it's going
to share Anonymous data on other
websites in the same industry and the
benefit of that is we get to see what
other websites or how other websites are
performing compared to ours what's the
Benchmark in our industry and so the
benchmarking to me is important and I'm
going to go over that in a few minutes
when we go over the different reports
but to me I would always opt into
benchmarking because this is the only
report Google provides in analytics
about how others in your industry is
performing versus your website okay so
it's a way to compare your website
performance against others in the same
industry the other options here
technical support and account specialist
I would also recommend you opt into
those because then it allows you to
basically Google allow Google access to
your account and they'll be able to help
you if you occur or run into any issues
so these are the options in setting up a
Google analytics account it's very
simple very easy to do you're just
entering in a few Fields note that we
talking about a website right now so I'm
talking about demo. simply learn.com but
just know that if you want to track a
mobile app Google analytics will allow
you to do that as well you just choose
the option option mobile app so we're
tracking a website we want to know how
users behave when they get to my website
and that's what Google analytics is
going to allow us to measure and look at
we just need to do a couple more steps
in the process so once we fill out these
fields here we're going to click get
tracking ID now I'm going to accept the
terms of service I'm going to accept
another terms and service in relation to
data protection I'm going to click
accept once I accept I'm going to be
able to get some tracking code the
tracking ID is the ID associated with
your account and so this number is going
to be associated with your account so
your account ID starts with youa and
it's going to be this number here now
the dash one is the property you set up
so in this case I set up demo.
simplylearn
that same account then I can certainly
set up multiple properties just know
that every property I set up in that
account is going to have a d
1-2-3-4 Etc depending on how many
properties I set up so by default I set
up one property so my first property ID
is -1 if I set up a second property the
same account number it's just going to
have a-h to and that's important because
that ID
that account and property ID is going to
be associated with that particular
property or website so again once you
finish setting up the account settings
then you're going to be asked to add
some tracking code to your site and that
tracking code is going to be related to
the account and the property so notice
my tracking ID up here notice the
tracking ID in the snippet of code now
this snippet of code needs to go on
every page of your website that you want
to track and you don't have to put it on
every page but if you want to track
website behavior on every page or
website then it needs to go on every
page of your website so if you're using
a you know platform like Drupal or jow
or even more popular platform like
WordPress adding the tracking code
sitewide is as easy as maybe adding a
Google analytics plugin to Wordpress for
example and then just simply pluging in
the ID now there's an alternative to
adding the Google analytics tracking
code to your site and that's Google tag
manager so Google tag manager is the way
I would recommend going so if you're not
familiar with Google tag manager I would
recommend watching the YouTube video we
have on Google tag manager you can just
go to YouTube Type in simply learn
Google tag manager and this will give
you a nice overview of you what Google
tag manager is and how it works but
basically this is the way I would go and
I would recommend that in addition to
having Google analytics you set up a
Google tag manager account and then that
way you can put the tracking code in
Google tag manager so if I go to Google
tag manager and I just go into an
account on tag manager I can just simply
put in the Google analytics ID right
into tag manager and so if I have it in
tag manager then tag manager is going to
be the place that holds the code and
fires page view when somebody comes to
my website so that way I don't have to
add the tracking code to my website if I
do it in tag manager so that's the
recommended method for me is to add the
Google analytics ID associated with tag
manager if you can associate it with tag
manager then that's the easier route to
go versus putting code on your website
okay so again take a look at the video
we have on YouTube for Google tag
manager that's the route I would go now
once you do get the tracking code on
your website whether that be through
Google tag manager or through a Plugin
or you know just simply adding the
script to your site to pages on your
site then what's going to happen is
you're going to start collecting data so
that's ideally the way it works you need
to add this code to your website now if
you're not ready to do that and you
simply want want to basically understand
how Google analytics works then I would
recommend getting access to Google
analytics demo account and so if you
just type in and search Google analytics
demo account basically what you're going
to do you're going to choose the first
listing there and you're going to go to
demo account so if you have a Google
analytics or Google login then all you
need to do is click on access demo
account and so what Google's going to do
is put this demo account into your
account and so it's going to look
something like this if I click on demo
account here it's going to add to my
Google analytics account so I'm going to
have then access to the demo account
from Google in Google analytics so I
would recommend going this route here if
you're not familiar you're not sure what
you're getting yourself into so think of
the demo account as kind of a test drive
you're test driving Google analytics
before you even add add any code to your
website so again all you need is a
Google account and if you have a Google
account and you add the demo account to
your Google analytics account you're
going to be able to see how analytics
works okay and so that's what I would
also recommend so if you're not ready to
start adding code to your website then
what you can do is just simply add the
demo account and then once you add the
demo count you're free to peruse around
Google analytics to see the different
types reports it has to offer now when
you do actually set up a Google
analytics account you're going to have
some settings that you're going to want
to pay attention to so when you set up
the account you have the account name
and then you have a property so under
each property you have by default you're
going to have one View and so here you
can see this view here so if we look at
the account we set up we set up a demo
simply learn account property is demo
simply learn so that's associated with
the website we're going to track and
then again by default under each
property you're going to have a view and
so by default the name of the view is
going to be called all website data and
so in that view is where all your
analytics data is going to be stored so
you can see my screen here there's a lot
of different settings you have you have
settings under the account you have
settings under the property and you have
settings under the view so we're going
to talk more about these settings and
future webinars for advanced Google
analytics users but for now know that
there's a bunch of settings that you
have that you can play around with when
it comes to Google analytics anything
from adding users to your Google
analytics account your Google anix
property or view you can actually set up
goals you can set up filters you can set
up segments you can link up Google ads
you can you know set up remarketing list
there's a lot you can do in terms of the
settings as it relates to Google
analytics but so no those settings are
there they're located right down here
and this little sprocket icon that's the
admin icon so if you need to get to
these settings at any time you can
simply just click on the sprocket or the
admin icon and then you'll be prompted
to choose any one of these settings here
that you want to edit or alter so now
let's take a look at some Google
analytics reports so once you've
actually set up your account you have a
number of different reports that you
have available to you in Google
analytics so we're going to take a look
at you know customize reports we're
going to look at real time audience
reports acquisition behavior and
conversion so these are all the
different reporting buckets if you will
that you have available to you in Google
analytics so if I'm an admin and I'm
looking at the Google demo account let's
start out by looking at real time so if
I click on the real time report and I
just click on overview so basically what
this is going to do is show me at this
point in time how many users I actually
have active on the website okay so
that's why they call it real time
reporting because it allows you to see
the behavior of users who are currently
on your website and so this is the
overview report under real time and you
can see here I can see that 79% % of my
users are coming from desktop 18% 20%
are coming from mobile and then
approximately 3% are coming from tablet
here I can see how they actually came to
the website so this is the referring
Source if they came from say search or
social I can see the source there and I
can see what pages they're active on and
then here I could see what locations
where they're located and so if I want
to see a breakdown of everything in the
overview I can certainly do that if I go
to locations under real time I can see a
majority of my users are coming from the
United States okay where are they coming
from I'll just click on traffic sources
and here I could see the different
sources and mediums medium is the means
in which the traffic was driven so if
it's Google it's either paid search or
organic search so I can see here it's
organic then I can actually see what
content they're looking at on my website
so I can see currently have three active
users on the homepage two active users
on the Google's women's white te page so
forth and so on now most importantly if
you have a event tracking set up so if
you taking a look at our Google tag
manager webinar you know that you could
set up event tracking in Google
analytics to measure engagement on your
website whether that be a form
submission or somebody clicking on the
play button of a video so if I click on
events I'll be able to see what events
are firing so here I can see we have
event tracking set up and I can see how
many different events are firing on my
website in real time so here I can see
Ecommerce somebody clicking on the quick
view click some you a couple of users
clicking on add to cart a couple of
users clicking on the promotion click
and as these events are fired you're
going to be able to see them highlighted
so if something gets fired it's going to
get highlight Ed and I could see that
these are the current events that I have
currently firing on the website and
that's what's currently fired now if I
want to look at the events that have
happened in the last 30 minutes I could
just click on this link here last 30
minutes and it's going to give me an
overview of the events that have
happened over the past 30 minutes okay
so that's event tracking and then more
importantly we can also look at what
conversions are happening in real time
just by clicking on conversions and so
now I could see I had one active user
who entered the checkout so that's goal
number four so in analytics you can have
up to 20 goals and so here I can see we
have goal number four has already had
one active user and so if I look at the
last 30 minutes I can see I still have
only one goal over the last 30 minutes
and that was somebody who entered the
checkout so that's real time reporting
in summary it just gives you an idea of
what's currently happening on your
website and so for me ideally if I'm
launching a campaign or let's just say
you do a new website redesign and you
want to see how users performing and
behaving then real time is a good option
for you so you can see how things are
happening in real time now let's jump
down to audience reporting so if I click
on audience if is just right underneath
real time I'm going to see a number of
different reports available to me on
under audience and so let's click on the
audience overview report so audience
reporting basically allows us to get a
sense of who is coming to our website
when I say who is coming to our website
it doesn't necessar have to be a
specific person in fact Google doesn't
allow personally identifiable
information in Google analytics personal
identifiable information such as a
specific name uh social security number
number credit card information Etc
however we could still paint a nice
picture on who is coming to our website
meaning what country city or state did
they come from what language what device
did they get to our website from how old
were they okay were they male or female
or other what interest did they have
what browser did they use so we can
paint a nice picture based on all this
information that Google Google analytics
is providing us under audience so if I
go to audience overview here I can see I
have all these different options
available to me to get a basic
understanding of who is coming to our
website so for example I could see a
majority of the people coming to our
website speak English and are from the
United States okay in fact that
represents 61% of the users and so
Google analytics does a great job of
giving me an overall percentage so if I
have a 100% of the users I could see 61%
of those users represented english-
speaking users from the United States 7%
represented English-speaking users from
Great Britain and so when it comes to
analytics we have users and users are
broken down into two categories they're
either returning or they're new so when
you add the Google analytics tracking
script to your website what's going to
happen is if a user or when a user goes
to your website they're going to get
cookied and if it's the first time
they've been to your website what Google
analytics is going to do is store a
cookie in the browser so when that same
user comes back another day in the same
browser analytics is going to recognize
that that cookie is in the browser and
so then analytics is going to categorize
that user as a returning user okay so
that's how analytics is able to
differentiate new versus returning so if
that user doesn't have a cookie in the
browser then analytics is going to
recognize that store the cookie and then
count that user as a new user and so
when you're looking in analytics you're
going to be able to see a breakdown of
new versus returning so here I can see
over 34s of my traffic over the past
week here I can see April 6th through
April 12th three over 3/4 are new users
to the website here I could see about 23
24% are returning users okay so I can
get a good breakdown of what type of
users are coming am I driving new
traffic am I driving traffic that's been
to my website before what language are
they speaking okay I can also paint a
bigger picture how old are they are they
what gender are they do they come from
mobile so let's take a look at some of
these different reports under audience
so if I skip down now to demographics I
can click on overview and when that
report loads
I can see now under demographics
overview I can see the breakout of age
ranges and so here I can see the
majority of the traffic coming to my
site again over the past week now if I
want to change this date range I could
simply do that I can change the date
range just by clicking on the date range
and then maybe going say the last 30
days and I can even compare it to the
previous period or the previous year I'm
going to choose the last 30 days I'm
going to click apply now I'm looking at
data over the last 30 days and again you
can change the date range to any range
you want you can only go back as far as
when you actually created the Google
analytics account you can't go prior to
that so here I'm looking at the last 30
days and I can see almost
47% of my users were in their age range
of 25 to 34 now when it comes to gender
I can see 60
6% represent males so I can get a
breakout of gender and age as well as
interest and click on interest and look
at the overview there and see what the
interest is of the users who are coming
to my site based on in market segments
or Affinity I can also choose language
and location so if I want to know
exactly where my users are located when
they're coming to my website I can click
on location and here I can get a
breakout 43% of the users of the last 30
days were from the United States more
importantly I can align my audience with
goals and we'll talk about goals here in
a minute but here I can see if I have an
e-commerce website I can see of those
43% 29% of those converted or purchased
something and that equates to 94
transactions so I can get a good sense
of not only how how many users are
coming from a specific country but are
those users converting if I click on
mobile and mobile to me is one of those
reports I tend to spend a bit of time on
cuz I want to know what devices users
are coming to my website and so for my
website here or this is the Google demo
website I can see mobile represents
approximately
27% of the traffic so desktop still
represents a majority of the traffic so
for you you want to keep an eye on
mobile because mobile is definitely a
majority of what people use nowadays
that's how people start their day that's
how they transact Via Mobile whether
that's purchasing something
communicating or searching it all starts
with mobile so you want to keep an eye
on mobile and more importantly you want
to keep an ey Behavior so Google
analytics is telling me that yes I have
approximately 20 7% of my traffic of the
last 30 days came from mobile how are
they interacting with my website so if I
look across this report I'm going to be
able to see different metrics so if I'm
measuring specific metrics against my
dimension in this case the dimension is
what we're measuring and in this example
we're measuring mobile I can see that
the bounce rate is approximately 48% and
bounce rate means means that if a user
in this case from mobile landed on a
page they left the site without going
any further so they consider it a bounce
if they don't go to another page if they
leave the site from the page they landed
on and they don't go any further that's
considered a bounce so a bounce rate is
the percentage of people who come to the
site and leave the site without going
any further so in this case we have 48%
bounce rate that's almost half of our
users who come from mobile leave the
website from the page they landed on so
is that good is that bad well it's open
to interpretation is definitely
subjective but you want to keep the
balce rate as low as possible you want
to keep people on your site especially
if you have an e-commerce website you
want people who come to your website to
purchase and so here we can see 48%
Mobile in desktop it's a little bit low
lower at 41% now if I look a little bit
further at engagement I can see how many
pages on average do mobile users look at
so versus desktop it's a little bit
lower you can see 3.86 on desktop it's
4.5 now if I look a little bit further
in engagement I want to be able to
measure how long somebody from mobile
stays on the website if they're bouncing
at 48% but they're also looking at 3 3.8
Pages 3.9 almost four pages per session
then that means in this report analytics
is tell me they're spending about 2
minutes on the site and interestingly
enough I can see that mobile over the
last 30 days had more transactions so 51
transactions versus 34 transactions from
desktop and interestingly enough the
e-commerce conversion rate is at 29%
that's higher than desktop at 007 it's
lower than tablet but it's higher than
desktop and mobile has the most
transactions and since they have the
most transactions they have the most
Revenue at
2,380 so yes the engagement isn't
exactly as great as it is as desktop but
we can see that people are still
purchasing with their mobile devices so
it's something to keep an eye on and
mobile is something I definitely look at
in fact since it's such an important
report one thing you can do in analytics
is if you actually like a report and you
think you're going to look at that
report multiple times then you can
simply just go ahead and click save at
the top here so if I click save I'm
going to enter a name for this report
I'm just going to call it mobile report
and click okay and then what's going to
happen is it's going to be located under
save reports and save reports is located
under customization customization is is
located above real time okay so if I
close that up you can see audience real
time customization if I click on
customization if I click on Save reports
I should be able to see my save report
here and I do so here I can see mobile
report if I click on it I can simply go
to the report I was looking at before I
saved it so save reports to me is a good
feature in analytics cuz it allows you
to quickly access a report that you've
saved in the past so let's take a look
at one more report under audience and
let's go to benchmarking so remember
when we were setting up our analytics
account we had the option to opt into
benchmarking and I recommended you do so
and so if you did actually opt into
benchmarking then you're going to be
able to see how your site compares to
others in the same industry so if I
click on Benchmark and and then click on
channels what I'm actually able to do
now is compare my website with others in
the same industry so if I go back to say
jobs in education and I choose education
all education as my industry vertical I
should be able to see websites that are
in the same particular industry and how
I compare with those websites so I'm
choosing all countries I can narrow that
down if I wanted to I can just search
for the United States I can choose a
specific State and then I can choose a
particular site size so here I'm
choosing sites by daily session so these
are sites that have an average of 5,000
to almost 10,000 sessions a day and so
in this vertical education in the United
States sites that have 5,000 to
99,999 sessions per day that means that
they're approximately 310 web properties
contributing to this report okay based
on this criteria I chose now if my site
is similar meaning if I'm in the United
States if I'm in education and I'm
receiving 5,000 to
9,999 sessions per day then I'm able to
compare my site against 310 other
websites now Google's sharing this data
anonymously from the other websites and
they're doing the same with your website
to those particular websites
benchmarking reports okay so it's shared
data anonymous
in particular Industries and verticals
and so now I'm looking at a channel
report so if I want to see how I compare
to others in my industry then I can go
ahead and see by channel for example am
I driving as much traffic as others in
my industry and you can see I'm not in
fact I'm 76 77% worse in terms of the
amount of traffic being driven from
organic search so any anything in red is
going to show as a negative result a
negative comparison whereas something in
green is a positive comparison so if I
look at engagement I can see that I
might not be driving as much traffic but
I can see that the pages per session are
better than the site average or the
industry average I can see if I go over
again looking just at organic search I
can see the bounce rate is better than
the industry average so the channel
report under benchmarking allows you to
measure how you compare to others in
your industry and you could do so by
looking at location and devices so if
you opted into benchmarking when you set
up your account then you'll be able to
compare your website against others in
your industry in your country region and
based on the size of your website in
terms of how many visitors or sessions
you're getting per day so let's go from
audience to acquisition so if audience
is who is coming to your website
acquisition allows us to see how the
traffic was driven to your website so
how did these users get to our website
and so under acquisition if we click on
overview we'll be able to see an
overview of how users whether they're
returning or new came to our website and
so what analytics does by default is
they have a number of default channels
and when we say channels we mean
analytics is grouping different channels
based on how users got to your website
meaning how did users get to our website
did they come via organic search meaning
did they type something into Google and
find you in the organic listing
analytics also groups users based on
whether they came to your site directly
meaning did they type in the URL
directly into the browser or did they
bookmark your website and come back via
the bookmark so they're grouping used
users under direct they also group users
under referral meaning do they come from
another website they group users by
social do they come from a social media
platform like Twitter or Facebook if
you're running paid search meaning if
you're running paid search on say Google
then do they come from Paid search ads
now if you're running display ads on say
Google's Network Google's Display
Network that's a default channel so
analytics Will Group users there so if
they don't recognize a channel then
they're going to group it as others so
by default Google analytics groups users
on how they came to your website via
these default channels and so I can see
how many users came to the site from
each Channel now if I want to drill down
on this report I can click on all
traffic and then if I click on all
traffic I can go to channels I can look
specifically at the channels report and
so now I can see organic search again
over the last 30 days is the number one
channel driving traffic and they
represent approximately again you can
see this number here in parentheses next
to the raw number of users I can see
that number is about
56% so 56% of my traffic over the last
30 days came from organic search and so
those are the number of users again as a
metric you're also going to have
sessions and you'll see sessions a lot
as a metric so users are broken down
between new and returning so every time
a new or returning user comes to the
website basically what they're doing is
initiating a session so you can have a
user who can come back multiple times
every time they come back to the website
it's a session so session is simply the
start of somebody coming to your website
and the session ends when they leave the
website and so just like we looked at
with the
audience reports when it came to mobile
we can also look at engagement by
channel so just like mobile we looked at
balance rate pages per session average
session duration we can do the same
thing here with our Channel report more
importantly in addition to behavior we
can see conversions and since we're
running an e-commerce platform we could
see what the conversion rate is by
channel so organic search did drive the
most traffic and they did have the most
transactions over the last 30 days and
the conversion rate in this case is17
okay so how Google determines the
conversion rate they basically take the
number of transactions and divide that
by sessions so that means that over the
last 30 days organic search drove 38,1
123 sessions and of those 38,1 123 64
actually turned into transaction which
equates to17 which also equates to 3,000
in Revenue so I'm able to determine not
only how users are getting to my website
by looking at the channel report I can
actually see if they're engaging and if
they are converting and notice when you
look at a report in analytics you can
look at it by Channel you'll also get a
summary so here I can see a summary or a
total based on my date range so I can
see over the last 30 days I've had
54,000 users
49,000 of them were new okay that meant
that out those 54,000 users I had 70,000
sessions I can see my average bounce
rate was 43% the pages per session were
just over four and the average session
duration how long did somebody stay on
my website on average about 2 minutes
and 55 seconds the average conversion
rate was .14 and I had a total of 97
transactions totaling
$5500 okay and that's all over the last
30 days so any report you look at in
analytics is going to have a summary and
note that any report you look at in
analytics is going to allow you to save
it so if it's a report you think you're
going to go back and look at at a future
date then you simply just have to click
on the save button conversely if you
don't want to save it you can simply
just export it so you can export it as a
PDF if I click on PDF it's going to
allow me to export that as a PDF now you
have other options available to you as
well you can do a Google sheet you can
export it as an Excel or you can export
it as a common Del limited file so here
you can see I can save it as a PDF if I
want to and if I click okay it's going
to save to my desktop or location of my
choosing and then I can go back and look
at it in that format at a later time so
that's the export feature available to
you in analytics again if you you could
save it as well or you can export it
okay some other reports under
acquisition if you're running Google ads
note that you can connect Google ads to
analytics and this is key because now I
can see how many people are coming from
Google ads to my website and are they
converting now this is important because
with Google ads I'm actually cign for
the click so you can see here I'm
running a report based on campaign data
so I could see what campaigns are
driving traffic how much I'm paying per
click and you can see on average I'm
paying 34 cents per click and then more
importantly I want to be able to see if
they're converting so you can see I've
spent
$810 over the last3 days and received
$858 in Revenue so you want to make sure
that you link up your Google ads account
to your Google analytics account for
this very reason you want to be able to
see how your Google ads campaigns
perform once the users get to your
website and so I want to see if they're
engaging and I want to see if they're
converting so there are all sorts of
reports under Google ads so you can look
at it by keywords by search queries by
hour of the day if you're running
display campaigns you can look at
display targeting so there all sorts of
reports under Google ads you just have
to link it up and you link it up under
the admin now there are other reports
that you can look at so if I go to
campaigns I can look at all campaigns so
if you're running all sorts of different
types of campaigns whether that be on
Facebook whether that be email whether
that be you know other types of
advertising let's just say Twitter or
Instagram you're going to be able to see
those campaigns here and that's under
all campaigns and again you'll be able
to see the campaign name and you'll be
able to see metrics associated with
those campaigns and more importantly
you'll be able to see your e-commerce if
you're running e-commerce platform or if
you have goals set up so you'll be able
to look at how your campaigns are not
one not only driving traffic but two are
they converting let's go from
acquisition reporting to behavior so
Behavior reports are going to actually
show you how users behaved once they got
to your website once they landed on a
page on your website how did they behave
so when we looked at audience we got a
sense of who is coming with acquisition
we get a sense of how the traffic got to
our website did they come from organic
direct social Etc the behavior reports
allow us to actually measure how that
traffic behaved once they landed on a
page on our website and so if I go to
overview under Behavior now I'm looking
at this graph here it's showing me how
many page views I've had and a page view
is simply once a page is viewed it's
counted as a page view so if a user
comes to my site they're initiating a
session and if they look at a page then
that page is going to have a page view
okay so a user can look at a page
multiple times in a session and every
time they look at that page it's going
to count as a page view so here I can
see in this graph how many pages I've
had again over the last 30 days and if I
look further at my overview report I can
see the specific pages and how many
pages they've had and I can also look at
some other metrics okay the average
balce rate the average time on page I
can look at the exit rate which means
how many people actually exited or the
percentage of people who exited from
that page so I can dig deeper into my
Behavior reporting so if I click on site
content and I click on all pages then
I'm going to look at a report by Page
this is my Dimension this is what I'm
measuring my page and now I can see how
many page views each page had over the
last 30 days now note you also have
something called unique page views so
unique page views is equivalent to one
per session and other words if a user
came to my site and looked at the
homepage then the homepage is going to
have have one unique page view and one
page view now if the user in that same
session looks at other Pages then every
page that user looks at is going to have
one unique page view however if the user
goes back to to the same page in the
same session then it's still going to be
one unique page view but in this case
the homepage if they look at the
homepage a second time then the homepage
is going to have two page views if they
look at the homepage five times in one
session then the homepage is going to
have five total page views and one
unique page view okay so that's why
unique pag views is equivalent to one
per session where page views is a
accumulation of how many times the page
was viewed in the same session so in
other words you're always going to have
more page views than unique page views
okay so this gives me a sense of how my
page is performed so again I can look at
total page views and then engagement so
ideally what you want to do with a
report like this is if a user is not
engaging on the page then that should
tell you something about the page itself
if they're not engaging if the bounce
rate's high if the time on page is low
if the exit percentage of exit rate is
high then you probably want to do
something with that page now these are
all pages but if I jump down to landing
pages my landing page report is showing
me how many people actually landed on
that page and so here I can see under my
landing page report I can see the
homepage had
36,7 sessions in the last 30 days that's
how many people landed on the homepage
so here I can see 71% were new sessions
meaning that I had a lot of new users
who landed on the homepage in fact
25,000 or
52% of the people who landed on the
homepage were new I could see the
balance rates about 42% % but of those
who didn't bounce they went on to look
at about 4.5 pages per session and spent
about 3 minutes on the site and the one
thing I like about the landing page
report is I can also see whether that
particular page in this case the
homepage did it help contribute to a
goal or conversion and in this case I
can see of those 36,000 sessions I had
22 transactions totaling 1,200 revenue
and that's an e-commerce conversion rate
of
.6% so the homepage over the last 30
days contributed to
.6% of the revenue so this gives you an
idea of when somebody lands on your
website and they land on a page is that
page helping to move that person along
meaning are they not bouncing and is
that page helping to move people towards
converting and so that's what the
landing page effect allows us to measure
is the engagement and in this case we're
measuring transactions okay so analytics
also gives us some other reports under
Behavior including sight speed so sight
speed to me is an important report to
look at just like the mobile report to
me sight speed's important because what
Google analytics does is they take a
sampling of pages and in this case you
can see over the last 30 days they
sampled 283 35 page views and of that
sample they came back and said the
average page low time is about 4 seconds
now ideally you want to keep it as quick
as possible I would say even under 3
seconds okay now there are other factors
involved with page load time the browser
you're using the country that you
actually browsing that page from mind
not how to have the best infrastructure
you may may not even be on the best
internet Network meaning you're on a
cell network or the Wi-Fi is not that
great or you can be on a page that just
has a lot of images or a lot of code
that may slow it down so there are other
factors involved and so what Google
analytics does is show you what those
factors are so here I can see by browser
what the average load time is if I want
to look at Country I can see what
country is contributing to the lad time
now the great thing about the sight
speed report is if I go to speed
suggestions okay what speed suggestions
is going to do is it's going to show me
the page load Time by Page and then it's
actually going to provide a link where I
can actually click on to get suggestions
on increasing the page load time so for
example I can look at this particular
page here this Google redesign shop by
Brandy page line number five if I look
at line number five I can see the
average load time of this page is 8
seconds almost 99 seconds okay that's an
eternity to some people now notice this
link next to it so Google's recommending
seven total suggestions so if I click on
seven total what it's actually going to
do it's going to open up a new window
and it's going to open up another Google
report called page speed insights and
Page speed insights is going to give me
some information about what I can do to
create cor correct the page load of that
particular page so look at the sight
speed report it's important because
there is a correlation between sight
speed or page load time and user
behavior of that page and there's also
correlation between page load time and a
page ranking organically on search so
page load time is very important it's so
important that I'm even going to save it
so I'm going to click save and click on
speed site speed suggestions as my name
and click okay and now that report is
going to be saved under customization
under save reports let's jump from
Behavior to conversions now conversion
reporting is arguably the most important
section in Google analytics because what
the conversions reporting allows us to
do is see how people are converting or
if they're not converting on our website
and so in Google analytics we have the
opportunity to set up goals now you have
the opportunity to set up 20 goals in
your Google analytics View and so to set
up a goal okay so you're going to click
on admin and Under The View you're going
to see goals and so if you don't even
have goals the first step is to create
goals and so you have four different
goal types in analytics so you have
pages per session so how many pages per
session is so if your goal is set to say
three or two if somebody actually look
at two or three pages per session it's
going to count as a goal okay so if I
look here I can see I have pages per
session set at 10 so that means that if
a user came to the site looked at more
than 10 pages per session then it's
going to count as a goal another goal
type is destination so destination means
that if somebody actually went to a
specific page then it's going to count
as a goal and in this case I can see
here
that the goal is set to this particular
page here and so when somebody actually
lands on that page it's going to count
as a goal now there are two other goal
types we can look at one is duration so
just like pages per session in our
previous example if somebody looked at
10 pages per session it's going to count
as a goal with duration it's based on
time so in this particular case if you
set up a duration goal and the duration
is set to say 1 minute and 30 seconds
then that means if a user comes to my
website and they spend at least 1 minute
and 30 seconds then it's going to count
as a goal okay and then the fourth type
of goal in Google analytics is an
event-based goal so when you set up
event tracking you could turn that event
into a goal so if somebody clicks on say
the submit button of a form you can turn
that event into a goal so here you could
see the category equal contact form so
you can always verify if a goal works
just by clicking on verify this goal and
in this case this event is turned into a
goal so anytime somebody fires this
event it's going to count as a goal so
you have four different goal types in
Google analytics you have pages per
session destination event and duration
and so once you've set up a goal then
you can measure goals under conversions
so now if I look at goals overview I can
be able to see how many total goal
completions I've had so if I want to
look at it by goal I can just choose the
goal option here so if I want to look at
for example goal two engaged users this
was the pages per session I can see that
I had a conversion rate of 10% meaning
that I had
7,000 of all the users who came to the
website 7,000 goal completions meaning
7,100 6 users looked at 10 pages or more
on my website and so that's how you want
to be able to measure whether users
where they ever they're coming from
whoever they are whatever Pages they
look at you want to be able to look at
the conversion reports to see if they're
actually converting based on the goals
you've set up whether that's pages per
session duration destination or event
goal conversion tracking reports can
help you measure who is actually
converting and then the great thing
about Google analytics here is that I
can actually see by segment so the
default segment and a segment is just
looking at a specific user set so the
default segment is always all users
however I can choose a different segment
so if I want to choose instead of all
users if I want to choose Mobile Traffic
I can select Mobile Traffic hit apply so
I'm actually now looking at a sub set of
data I'm looking at mobile traffic so of
all the mobile users who've came to my
site I can see
1,400 engaged or looked at 10 pages or
more okay and that's a 7% conversion
rate so the great thing about Google
analytics is you have the opportunity to
set up four different goal types okay
based on those goal types you can go to
goals overview and look at the
conversion rate of each goal but you can
also change the segment of that
particular goal to see who exactly
converted okay another report I like
under conversions is the multi-channel
funnel report so if I click on multi-
channel funnel basically what this
allows me to do is see how different
channels work together to convert so
remember the channel reporting we looked
at under acquisition here I can see now
how different channels work together to
drive the conversion so if I look at
three channels direct organic and
referral I can see all three together
Drive 2% of the conversions if I look at
direct and referral 12 1/2% if I look at
direct and organic
12.24% so I can see how different
channels work together and so if I look
at top conversion paths as an example I
can actually see what channels how
channels work together to drive the
conversion so in this example I can see
over the last 30 days that my top
Channel grouping was direct times two
meaning that somebody came to the
website directly meaning they typed in
the URL in the browser or they
bookmarked it and came to the site okay
they came the first time but didn't
convert but then they came back a second
time via direct and then converted so
that combination is my top conversion
combination of the last 30 days my
second best conversion grouping is
organic search and direct meaning that a
user came to the website via organic
search first did not convert and then
came back via direct the second time and
converted so basically what analytics
does is give credit to the last referral
meaning if you came to the website via
referral a referring website and
converted then the referring website's
going to get the credit for the
conversion but analytics does a good job
of showing you how different channels
work together so a channel may drive a
lot of traffic like organic search but
that traffic may not convert the first
time around for a number of different
reasons whether it could be brand
recognition Price shopping reading
content whatever the case analytics is
able to measure if that channel actually
did contribute at a later point and in
this case we could see organic search
drove traffic that didn't convert but
that traffic came back a second time via
direct and did convert so that's our
second best Channel grouping and so the
multi- channel funneling report talk
conversion pass to me is a good report
to look at so you can actually see not
only have channels work together but you
can see sources and mediums and
campaigns and how all that all those
different campaigns and different
sources work together to convert so
that's just a good report to look at
there are so many different reports
available in Analytics there's so many
that we haven't even gotten to yet so my
advice if you look at the demo report
you can get a feel for each of these
reports under each section whether that
be audience acquisition Behavior or
conversions take a look at these reports
see what makes sense to you see what you
can use to improve your website
performance for this particular webinar
we're going to jump into Google
analytics directly and spend all of our
time there because it's about learning
practical application so goals are
important goals uh let me just say this
goals are in analytics something that
should be align with your business and
we call goals that are align with your
business kpis or key performance
indicators so it's very important as a
precursor that you know how to set up
goals in Google analytics because if
you're using Google analytics you want
to measure everything against a goal so
without further Ado let's jump right
into Google analytics so if I go to
Google analytics and I log in okay what
I want to do is go down to admin click
on admin here and admin will take you to
basically a screen that looks like this
where you have a account column you have
your property column and then you have
your view column now the view column is
where you're going to go to set up goals
okay so every view in every property has
up to 20 goals okay so by default in
analytics you're going to have at least
one view for your property so if I have
a property I'm going to have at least
one view but if I happen to set up
multiple views like you see here then I
know for every view I set up I have 20
goals to work with so where are those
goals so Under The View I'm going to
click on goals and now I can see I have
20 at my disposal now you can see here
by clicking on the recording column I
can see I have in this particular
property this particular view I have
five goals that are active so you can
use up to 20 but you don't have to have
20 active Okay you can have one active
two active my recommendation is at least
have one goal again when you set up a
goal you're going to measure everything
in analytics against that goal okay so
in this case we have five particular
goals we measuring so we have five
active out of 20 total so if I don't no
longer want to use a goal I can simply
just turn it off if I want to continue
using it just turn it on okay it's that
simple you could turn on and off goals
so here I already have five set up so if
you want to set up a new goal the one
thing you need to know in Google
analytics is in order to set up a new
goal okay you need to have edit access
at least the view level I would say at
the property level so you want to make
sure whoever's in charge of Google
analytics for your organization or if
you're in charge okay you simply just
want to go to user management and user
management you want to make sure the
email address you're using to log into
Google analytics has at least edit
permissions so you're going to need edit
permissions to add new goals so I have
edit permissions I'm going to go to
goals and I want to set up a new goal
but before we jump in and set up a new
goal what is it that we want to achieve
that's really the question we want to
ask ourselves what is the goal of the
website well if it's somebody
downloading something okay are you
measuring that download via an event
okay are are they filling out a form
submission before they download so if
they submit that form submission is that
the goal do you have any Commerce site
is somebody purchasing something so
these are things you want to ask
yourself before you actually set up the
goal what is it that I'm trying to
measure now when you actually do go to
set up a goal you're going to click on
the red CTA button that says new goal so
analytics actually has some templates
set up for you okay you can see them
here okay if you're somebody's
registering online or creating an
account or reading review downloading
something sharing something you could
choose all of these options here what I
normally do is choose custom 99% of the
time I'm just going to choose custom it
doesn't really matter if you use the
template or not it's just a template is
basically some free prefilled
configurations but my recommendation is
always just go with custom you want
Total control over how to set up your
goal so we already have in mind what
type of goal we want to set up so for
example if somebody goes to fill out a
form submission and they go to a thank
you page after that well what's the URL
of that thank you page we want to be
able to track how many people go to that
page because we know if somebody does
type in or fill in a form submission and
goes to that page we know that they
filled out the form and so for example
if I go to continue I'm going to name my
goal first so I'm going to say thank you
page as an example notice analytics is
assigning an ID so notice this is goal
ID 15 that means that that's the next
available goal there are 20 goals
available in analytics and so what
analytics does is they group goals
together so 1 through 5 6- 10 11- 15 16
through 20 into goal sets so for example
goal 16 through 20 is part of goal set 4
and why does Google analytics combine
these goals into different goal sets
well because it's easier to ma measure
and look at data by goal sets so for
example if I jump into any report here
if I go to all traffic channels and I
want to measure how many goals by
Channel I can look at it by goal set so
if I have goal set one selected then I
know any goal I have active in there
between goal id1 through goal id5 I'm
going to be able to see those goals and
goal set one and now I'm going to be
able to measure every goal I have active
in goal set one against the channel so
if I choose goal set two whatever goals
are active there goal set three Etc
notice I don't have any goals 16 through
20 active that are in goal set 4
therefore I don't have that option
available to me so back to admin the
bottom left navigation again goals okay
we want to measure somebody going to the
thank you page we have edit access we're
going to choose custom as our goal set
up we're going to type in a goal name
I'm just going to say thank you okay
this is goal 15 now this is the
important part Google analytics has four
different goal types destination
duration pages per session or screens
per session so screens per session is
related to mobile because Google
analytics measures mobile app activity
and then you have an event so we're
going to cover all four of these but for
the sake of this simple example I'm
going to choose destination why because
if somebody goes to that thank you page
we're going to go ahead and put in the
thank you page as the goal the goal URL
so for example destination is my choice
I'm going to click continue
now this is where I'm going to put the
URL so if my URL is just simply thank
you. HTML I can just go ahead and put
thank you. HTML or if it's just thank
you then I can just do thank you depends
on the website depends on the URI
structure so whatever that URL is that's
what you're going to put in and when
you're done you can verify it so what
Google analytics does is actually will
verify over the last s days if anybody's
actually gone to that particular page so
if we click verify we can see 0%
conversion rate so that tells us that if
this is the correct URL then we've had
0% people go to that page this is just
an example however if you didn't see a
conversion then you might want to make
sure you check the URL here that you put
in and if you do see a conversion rate
then you know it's working so Google
Google analytics actually has options so
we're saying thank you is equal to so
the destination URL is equal to thank
you or thank you. HTML or thank you. ESP
or whatever that thank you page is okay
you do have options so if you have a
long URL you could say begins with and
you could say begins with say thank you
so this is the logic we're going to say
hey if anybody goes to a URL that begins
with thank you then count count it as a
goal or you could say equals to so if
anybody goes to a UR that equals to
thank you then count it as a goal you
have one more option Here regular
Expressions so Google
analytics understands the language of
regular Expressions so regular
expression expressions are just special
characters used to communicate with
Google analytics in order to hone in on
exactly what you're trying to track so
we can always say you know starts with
or ends with with so we can you know use
characters like the dollar sign ends
with or begins with so we can always do
that so you can use regular Expressions
as well if you're familiar with regular
Expressions if you're not then you don't
have to use them but there are special
characters where that you can insert in
that are used as regular expression so
if you're not familiar the regular
expression don't choose that option you
can choose the other option of equals to
or begins with now note that on all
three of these options I didn't put the
domain so if my domain isad Das
foundation.org SL and then thank you I
don't need to put the domain because
analytics is already already knows what
domain we're tracking so you don't have
to put in the domain here when you're
entering in in this case the go URL so
you can omit the domain so when you put
in that URL you know that you have three
options to work with and then you always
always want to verify that go URL you
always want to verify it because if you
see 0% conversion and in this case over
the last s days then that should tell
you something either your goal is not
set up correctly or you just don't have
any conversions either way you want to
double check that now when it comes to
the destination URL goal you do have an
option here for funnel so if I turn on
on funnel then that means I have the
ability to track how people went through
my funnel so if I have a cart and I want
to be able to check how many people go
in and out of the cart then I have the
option of adding specific Pages as part
of the cart so we could say you know
step one which is basically cart we
could say step two is billing
information that could be SL billing we
could say step three is shipping
information SL shipping and then step
four could be you know confirm and that
could be slash confirmation so whatever
your url structure is for your cart and
it doesn't necessarily have to be a cart
basically all I'm doing is putting in a
series of steps with URLs as each step
and why do I want to do that because I
can then track how many people go
through my funnel that I've created okay
so here I could see this is my funnel
that I've created for this particular
goal okay and the funnel is only
available for the destination URL so the
funnel is available if you want to see
traffic through the goal okay and how
people go through the funnel and where
they drop off now you have an option
here to make the first step required so
if you make that first step require then
that means you're measuring the funnel
through the first step only now if I
turn that off then I'm measuring the
funnel through each step meaning that I
can measure people as they drop in and
out of the funnel where if it's required
the first step then I'm only measuring
traffic as it enters in the top of the
funnel so you have that option available
to you the funnel and then for all goals
you do have a value so if somebody did
actually convert Okay Google analytics
is going to count it as a conversion and
you you can assign a value so if you're
not an e-commerce website then you may
want to think about assigning value if
you are an e-commerce website then
analytics has the ability to track
e-commerce revenue for your website so
you don't need data value but in this
case let's just say your nonprofit
organization and you're collecting
donations and on average over the past
year every donation that somebody
contributed was equal to $5
well you can just go ahead and put $5 in
there as the value for that goal so that
means that if somebody did go to in this
example SL than you and convert
analytics is going to count it as a goal
and then assign $5 value alongside that
goal so if you're non- Ecommerce if
you're say a nonprofit like this
organization or your B2B and you want to
track some value then you have that
option there so with the destination
your Ro goal you have the option of
adding a funnel with all goal types you
have the option of adding a value all
goal types and we're going to go through
the rest of them you have the option of
verifying that goal so that's the
structure of setting up a goal
destination URL is just one goal type
we're going to talk about the other
three goal types because in Google
analytics there are four goal types
again destination is one of them with
destination as you do have the option
with all goal types is you have to be
able to choose your logic here so we're
going to cover that with the other three
but just know when you set up a
destination URL goal you have the option
of adding a funnel now when you actually
do set up a funnel what's going to
happen is analytics is going to measure
traffic as it goes through the funnel so
where do you look for that funnel
information well you want to get out of
admin you want to go to the left side
navigation you want to click on
conversions then goals then funnel
visualization So based on the funnel you
set up you're going to be able to see
traffic as it goes through the funnel so
notice on this particular funnel we
don't have the first step required why
because I can see traffic as it goes in
and out of each step of the funnel so
let's go through this funnel and see how
people react so here I can see the first
step is the store front page so over
this particular period of time I had 84
sessions enter the storefront page so
out of those 84 I can see 21 left the
storefront page 63 went on to the next
step in the funnel which is the cart
page I can then see 24 people went on to
the cart page directly and five exited
the site Al together okay so that gave
me 87 total and from 87 I saw that 82
went on to the next page with the next
step what analytics does is they give
you a percentage so in the first step we
had 63 move on to the C page out of 84
that's 75% so from the car page to the
create your account page we had
94% move on so we didn't have anybody
enter in the create your account page we
didn't have anybody leave to create your
account page so we have 82% 82 create
your account and then we have 82 move on
to the payment page so that's 100% okay
we have one exit so we have 81 that
proceeded to beyond the payment page
which was purchase so 81 of 82 is
98% and we started with 84 so that gave
us plus the 24 that we accumulated along
the way so that gave us a 75% funnel
conversion rate so 75% of the people who
entered in the funnel went on to
purchase okay so don't be confused with
the overall e-commerce conversion rate
so 75% is the funnel conversion rate the
overall conversion rate for this
particular goal is
18.45% over this particular period of
time why because that takes into account
all sessions that have won to the
website so 18% of all traffic went on to
convert but those that did go into the
funnel 75% converted so that's a look at
the funnel so if you set up a funnel
that's what it's going to look like you
have the option to measure everything
from step one and Beyond or measure as
traffic goes in and out of the funnel so
the purpose of this is we're going to be
able to see where traffic drops off how
effective our funnel is what pages we
need to address in that funnel okay so
that's the whole point of the funnel and
the funnel is available with the
destination URL goal so if I go back to
admin if I go back to goals Under The
View I can actually see what that funnel
looks like so here we chose regular
expression so this is what the URL is
okay you can see our funnel in each of
the steps we have set up notice we're
using regular Expressions here and then
if we verify this goal we could see over
the past 7 Days 19% conversion rate so
that tells me something's working in
this particular with this particular
goal because we do have a conversion
rate okay so that's the destination URL
goals let's now talk about the other
three types of goals so the next goal
type we're going to talk about is pages
per session so if you're not sure what
type of goal to set up for your website
at the very least you should try and set
up either duration related goal or pages
per session related goal so let's talk
about the pages per session so basically
what this goal is going to allow us to
measure is for example if we set the
goal to three pages per session then
we're going to be able to measure if how
many people went to the site and looked
at three pages per session so let's take
a look at that goal so if I open up the
goal here I can see three pages per
session is what we're naming it so
basically what we're asking analytics to
do is anything greater than two pages
which would be three and Beyond count as
a goal so if anybody comes to the site
looks at more than two pages three pages
or more then it's going to count as a
goal and so here we can verify it so if
we verify it over the last seven days we
could see a
4.12% conversion rate and that tells me
that 4% of my traffic over the last s
days looked at at least three pages or
more so you're probably asking yourself
well what number should I put in for the
actual variable so in this case we see
two well what you want to do is you want
to look at on average let's just say
year to dat you want to make sure you
have statistical significance so you
want to look at a period of time so if
you go to analytics go to audience okay
and then if you go to overview and if I
change my date range to year to date I
could see on average right now I have
1.21 pages per session so that's on
average so we don't want to make our
goal one page we don't want to make our
goal two pages we want to make it three
so we want to be able to to basically
measure at a higher rate okay why do we
want to measure at a higher rate because
if 1.21 is the average then two pages
per session really isn't moving the
needle so what we really want to do is
get people to stay on the site longer
look at Pages more uh during their
session so look at more pages and so we
want to be able to see what segment of
the audience is looking at more pages
what channels Drive traffic that's
looking at more pages what pages are
contributing to more pages per session
so the whole idea is you want to hone in
on what your goal is and see what's
working and then see what's not working
so you can make adjustments the whole
idea behind Google analytics is to
improve website performance and so if
our average is
1.2 then if we change it to just two it
may not be good enough so in this case
you know we want to up the bar a little
bit so we're going to choose three now
you can choose four or five that's
perfectly fine just know if you're
average is 1.2 I wouldn't choose one
page per session as my goal and I
probably wouldn't choose two so I'd set
the bar a little bit higher now the
third goal type available in Google
analytics is also engagement related and
that's duration so just like pages per
session we can measure how long somebody
stays on the website and we could set up
a goal for that so in this case I have a
goal set for 1 minute 30 seconds so my
goal type is duration so if I click
continue then basically I'm asking
analytics in this case anybody who stays
more than 1 minute and 30 seconds on the
website count it as a goal and so before
you actually put in the number of hours
minutes and seconds you want to look at
that average so if you go back to
audience overview here I can see a
minute and 7even so do we want a minute
and 30 maybe we could do that maybe we
can go with 2 minutes so again the whole
point is you want to set the bar a
little bit higher than what the average
is and so here I can see over the last 7
days if I verify this particular goal I
can see 8% of my traffic over the last s
days stayed on the site at least 1
minute and 31 seconds okay they stay
greater than 1 minute 30 and so the
whole point is you can hone in because
this is a goal I can go in this is goal
okay this is a goal here and so I could
see that this is goal 13 so now I can go
to acquisition as an example I can go to
channels as an example since this is a
goal this is goal 13 so that would be in
goal set three so I can actually see
what channel is basically driving that
goal okay in other words what channel is
driving traffic that is staying on the
side at least 1 minute and 30 seconds
and so that's the whole idea behind
goals so likewise for pages per session
we can go into channels and here I can
see we've have a over this period of
time year to date pages per session we
have 3% conversion rate and here I could
see for example organic search has a
133% conversion rate here I could see
social media has a 10% so I could see
that or people coming from organic
search are staying on the site longer or
they're looking at more pages than any
other channel so just like duration or
destination or any goal you set up you
can measure that goal against any
Dimension just because it's engagement
doesn't mean you can't you absolutely
can and and so the whole point of
Engagement related goals is to figure
out what's driving traffic to the site
but what traffic is engaging so you want
to be able to pinpoint that so you can
improve website performance now the
fourth goal type available in Google
analytics is an event so if you click on
new goal you clud custom click continue
you have the option to choose an event
so an event is something that you can
measure on your website that analytics
can't measure by default so if you want
to measure PDF downloads or clicks on
buttons or clicks on play buttons on a
video or click on a submit button or
click on an external link I mean you can
measure pretty much anything with an
event then you want to be able to turn
that event into a goal so let's quickly
summarize what an event is so again we
want to be able to measure a particular
event that happens on the website so in
order to do so we need to identify that
event so if I go to for example this
particular website here and I want to
measure how many times somebody clicks
on the Donate Now button well if I met I
can measure that as an event so when you
set up an event in analytics you have to
actually assign a category and an action
for for that event so that's the first
thing you need to do when you identify
an event related goal first you need to
set up the event and in order to set up
the event you need to assign a category
an action okay so once you identify what
you want to track as an event on your
website you're actually going to go in a
tag manager or have your Web Master go
in a tag manager and set up a tag and in
that tag they're going to assign that
particular category and action and so
here you could see we have this set up
our category is named donate now and our
action is click and that's what we want
to do we want to measure how many people
click on that donate Now button so
anytime somebody does that then the
category donate now is going to appear
in analytics with the action click so
when you actually do set up an event you
can go into analytics and you could test
that event so if I go to the website and
I click donate now Okay the reason why I
have this as an event is because I'm
taking to a third-party website to
handle the donations so here I can go
into analytics and now I can see a
category is being fired for header
donate with the action click so that's
my category and that's my action so that
category and action is what is firing
after somebody clicks on the Donate Now
button so if I want to turn this event
into a goal I can easily do that now
that I've set up the event now that I've
identifi the category and action I want
to go back to admin and set up the event
with these parameters in place so just
turns out we already have the goal set
up so let's go through how this goal was
set up so first we chose custom we chose
event we gave it a name so how the best
practice when you actually set up a goal
as an event or turn an event into a goal
I would add the prefix event call into
it and then that way when you're
identifying goals and you're reporting
you know it's an event so I'm going to
click continue and now that I've
actually have set up the event already
in Google tag manager I given it a
category I given it an action okay see
here you could see we have a regular
expression set up so anything with the
header donate or donate is going to fire
this goal so over the last 7 days I have
a 81% conversion rate okay I could have
easily put in equals to and put in
whatever the action what or the category
which is donate now or I could have put
action equals click I could have done
that as well so let me show you another
example here so if I do this custom
continue events donate now here's my
goal ID it's going to be an event so all
I need to do is put in the category and
action so donate now and then click so
that's all I have to do and that's my
goal so I can verify it okay to see if
anybody's fired it and basically that's
what I need to do to turn that event
into a goal okay so you need to set up
for an event first you need to identify
the event set it up in Google tag
manager which is another platform and
once you've done that then you have your
category in action once you have your
category in action you again going to go
into analytics and then simply put in
that category and action into the
appropriate fields to set up your event
related goal now all events don't have
to be turned into a goal if you actually
do set up an event and you're not worthy
of a goal meaning it's not a kpi or does
doesn't align with your business goals
well don't fret you can always just go
to behavior okay you can always go to
events you can always go to overview and
measure your events that way so here you
could see all of our events that are
fired now we do have this one turned
into a goal so if it's important for our
business then we want to make sure we
convert that particular event into a
goal okay if it's not important for
example somebody's just clicking on a
social button then you don't necessarily
have to turn that event into a goal if
you don't want to know that it's sitting
here under events under Behavior so the
point I'm trying to make here if it's
important to your business and you're
already tracking it as an event via
Google tag manager then feel free to
turn it into a goal all you need is that
category all you need is that action and
so so one final note on that event
related goal just like any other goal
you can add a value
okay so if I have an event set up I can
choose to add a value here or in Google
tag manager if I've assigned a value to
that event so if I go back to the actual
event in Google tag manager you could
say I have a value set up for $1 then I
could just go into analytics and say you
know what I already have the value added
so go ahead and use the value added in
Google tag manager okay so I'm going to
choose yes now if I choose no I have the
option to add the value here just like I
would with any other goal so just keep
that in mind you can add a value to any
goal type with an event related goal you
can add the value right into the tag in
Google tag manager just as I've done
here so remember when you actually set
up your goals whether it's a destination
pages per session duration or an event
you can just go ahead and choose choose
that goal set that it's in and measure
any Dimension against that particular
goal so here I can see e newsletter
signups by Channel I can go into another
goal set here I can see contact form
submissions okay I can see what
particular channels driving contact form
submissions okay so just know that you
can align a goal against any Dimension
so if you have e-commerce you don't have
to set up for goal for that that's
separate but if you want to take a look
at your goals and analytics on its own
you can just go to conversions goals
overview here I can actually get a good
sense of how my goals are performing
over a period of time so again if I
choose for example year to date now I
could see based on the goals I've set up
how many total goal completions value
which takes into account the value we've
added into these goals okay the total
conversion rate and here I can see it
broken down by the goal I actually have
set up and I could see it by Page or I
could see it by source and media so I
could see Google organic is driving the
most goal completions then Google CPC
direct and then I could see some others
in here as well contributing to goals
now I do want to point your attention to
another report in Google analytics that
does take into account goals and that's
multi- Channel funneling so again under
conversion goals multi-channel funnels
if I go to assisted conversions I can
actually see what channel in this
example is assisting with the
conversions I've set up and so what do
we mean by assisted conversions well
that means that if a channel let's just
say organic search drove traffic to the
website and that traffic didn't convert
when it arrived at the website and left
but it came back a week later via
another Channel let's just say email and
when they came back via email they did
convert during that session well what
analytics does is they give an assist to
organic search because they help Drive
the traffic to the website so it's
similar to the game of basketball if I
have the ball and I pass it to my
colleague and my colleague's the one who
scores cuz they had the ball last well
they get the credit for the point I.E
the conversion but I get an assist and
so analytics works the same way they're
always going to give credit to the last
click or direct conversion but they will
give credits to the channel in this case
that assisted with the conversion so
that's under assisted conversion and
that's based on the goals you have set
up you can highlight any particular goal
here if I want to hone in on say the
Donate clicks only then I'm going to be
able to see what contributed to that
particular goal so there's another
report in here top conversion path that
I think is important so after you set up
your goals you can actually see what
channels in this particular example help
to drive conversions again this is year
to dat so I can see all the different
combinations of channels that work
together to contribute to a conversion
so again I can choose a specific goal or
I can choose all my goals so those two
reports are under multi- Channel
funneling there's also another report
that I think is good that's time lag
meaning how long did it actually take
somebody to convert so here you can see
most of our conversions 265 year to date
happen on the day somebody arrived on
the website but I could see I did get
some conversions a day later 2 Days
Later Etc so you have time La top
conversion pass assisted conversions
they're all under multi-channel
funneling and they're all available
after you set up at least one goal and
so if you're not sure what goal to set
up okay don't fret you can always at
least set up an engagement related goal
so that's available to you duration
pages per session you also have
destination and event tracking and
they're all available to you you have 20
available per view now if you're not
quite sure exactly what type of goal to
set up there is an option available in
analytics and that's the gallery so you
can always import a goal from the
gallery so in other words we could take
a look at what other people have set up
in terms of goals so you just have to
click on the button import from gallery
and it'll take you to the gallery and
you'll be able to see what are the goals
others have set up today we're going to
talk about how to set up event tracking
in Google analytics so let's get started
so many of you out there have a website
similar to the one I'm looking at now
this is a nonprofit that I work with I'm
a foundation and like this website and
probably like your website you probably
have some interactivity on there that
needs to be tracked for example buttons
uh if you have buttons like this one
that says donate or newsletter sign up
or there's a PDF download or a video
that needs to be you know tracked based
on the amount of people who click on the
play button so I mean all sorts of inter
activity on a website have you ever
wondered how to track that well there is
a way to track that because by default
Google analytics can't track
interactivity and engagement on your
website like you probably want to to
have your website tracked so if you have
buttons and videos and things of that
nature that you want to have tracked
well you're going to need event tracking
and if you're in analytics and you're
always wandering around the data and you
happen to find yourself under events
well if you want events on your website
and you want data to populate under
Behavior top events you're going to need
to set up aent tracking so event
tracking is a two-part process and we're
going to talk about that two-part
process the first part of that is to
identify what you want to track okay so
if we go back to our example website
here I'm a foundation again we noted
there's a lot to track here we got a
donate now butt we got a newsletter sign
up we have some social icons okay we got
a donate Now button here we got a play
button here got all sorts of
interactivity you know we got a button
here that says you know purchase tickets
for an upcoming event I can go
throughout the website and find
different buttons and things to to to
track let me just say this there's no
shortage of what you can track on your
website with event tracking so event
tracking is just basically in layman's
terms tracking engagement on your site
because Google analytics by default is
only going to track page view data
meaning how somebody got to your website
what page they looked at how long they
stayed on that page what page they left
from more or less they timing how long
somebody stays on on the website and
what pages they look at so there's more
to a website than just how long has
somebody stayed on a page and so in this
example we want to be able to track
everything here not just the Dona Now
button but everything because once you
get the hang of event tracking then it's
very easy to set up okay so step one
identify what you want to track okay so
there's a lot we want to track we're
just going to use one example to start
off with and that's going to be this
donate Now button okay so
this donate now button we want to track
now we have a newsletter sign up we have
Facebook and and that's fine you could
track all that but for the sake of going
through a step-by-step process today
let's just focus on the Donate Now
button what's focus on the Donate Now
button then we'll come back and start
tracking these other things but this is
what we want to track to start out with
okay so step one identify what you want
to track now when it comes to tracking
events on a website you want to identify
those events and so we did that by
choosing this donate out button now once
we identify what we want to track we
need to assign two parameters for that
event so with event tracking you have
three parameters but one is actually
optional so you have two Mand mandatory
parameters that you have to assign to
everything you want to track on your
website and that's the category and then
the action so event label or label is is
the third parameter but again that's
optional okay so basically when we
identify an event on our website we want
to assign it a category and an action
okay so why do we want to assign it a
category and an action because when we
are in analytics under Behavior under
events top events we could see we have
different categories here and we have
different actions we have different
labels so if I click on any one of these
Dimensions I'm going to be able to see
some of the parameters I've entered in
for previous events I'm tracking okay so
the whole idea is you want to be able to
group different events together into a
category and assign an action and assign
a label to it that's really what you're
doing you're just grouping and
identifying the events you're trying to
track and so in this case I have this
donate Now button sitting in the header
okay in fact I have a lot of things
sitting in the header so if I wanted to
and I want to track all these buttons I
can create a category called header and
then if I track all these buttons all
these buttons can sit in that same
category if I wanted to or I can create
a separate category for each of these
buttons it's up to you how you organize
your categories because basically all
you're doing is giving a name to what
you're trying to track and the name is
equivalent to a category so in this case
the Donate Now button is very important
I'm just going to call it category head
or donate now I need to give an action
to each category and so in this case I'm
just going to say click because that's
what the action is doing it's it's
somebody's taking the action of clicking
now if it's a video and it's a play
button I can assign an action of play
it's up to you whatever you name these
parameters you just need to be organized
and methodical about what you name it
that's all and so in this case header
donate and then click okay and so that's
our category in action and so that's Cly
step two so step one identify what you
want to track step two assign a category
action and or label but remember label
is optional so if I go back in analytics
here I could see some categories and if
I click on action I can see some actions
that I've named now step three so we've
identified in Step One what we want to
track we've assigned a category and
action so step three is going into
Google tag manager to set up the event
okay so if you're not familiar with
Google tag manager then you can easily
just you know do a Google search for
Google tag manager and basically you'll
have all sorts of information on it
there's a good video overview of tag
manager here that you can watch so tag
manager basically is what we want to use
to set up event tracking now tag
managers use used for a lot of different
things but the main thing we're doing
here is setting up an event for our
website and so I'm logged in to the same
email address I'm using for analytics
okay so now I'm in tag manager and I
want to set up my event for this donate
Now button so what do I need to do well
for every event I want to set up I need
to set up a tag okay so if I go to tags
I can see I already have some tags set
up and some of these are events and so
when you actually set up a tag I
recommend having a naming convention so
here you can see any event we set up we
start out by calling it ga- event-
Whatever It Is we're trying to set up
and so in this case we want to set up a
new tag for the Donate Now button on our
website so we're in Google tag manager
because tag manager is what's going to
fire that event so if I click on new
okay and I click on tag configuration
I'm going to choose Google analytics and
then I'm going to choose event as my
track type so we want the data to show
up in Google analytics and we're
tracking an event we're not tracking a
page view we're tracking an event and so
now remember in step two you identified
what you want to call that category you
identifi what you want to call that
action and you have some optional
parameters like label so first things
first header donates the name of our
category and our action is click and if
you want to add in a label and a value
so if you want to assign a value you can
if you want to add in a label you can
okay those are optional so you just need
to focus on category and action and then
the last setting here that's probably
worth mentioning is a non- interaction
hit okay so this is automatically set to
false and why is it set to false because
it's a non- interaction no that's false
we want this event if somebody clicks on
the header donate to be an interaction
so for example if I land on this page
here and I click on that donate Now
button that I'm tracking as an event and
I actually leave the site because I have
my setting set to false I want that
click to be an interaction then
analytics is not going to count a bounce
if I change it to true so from false to
true then that means it is going to be a
non
interaction if somebody lands on the
page and if somebody clicks on the
button so I don't want it to be a
balance I want it to be an interaction
so my advice is leave it set to false
we're going to choose Google analytics
as our setting here this is our variable
for Google analytics so in other words
that variable is set to our analytics
property ID and more or less that's what
you need to do to set up the tag okay
you need to in step two identify the
category and action Andor label Andor
value now value can be anything you want
you're assigning a numerical value so if
you just assign one anytime that event
fires in analytics it's going to have a
value of one okay and we have our non-
interactions at to fall so anytime the
event fires it's going to count as an
interaction and therefore not count as a
bounce if somebody landed on that page
so that's more or less that's all you
need to do to set up the tag in Google
tag manager now if somebody else is
setting up the tag for you then again
you want to revert to step two you want
to be able to give that person the
appropriate category action and or label
and your value why because you're the
one that's going to be going into Google
analytics and you're the one that's
going to have to go to behavior events
top events and look for the particular
category in action Andor label so you
need to be able to communicate that
information to whomever is setting up
the tag now if it's you great you
already know what it is because you're
entering that information into tag
manager so in this case I'm going to go
ahead and choose a variable for my label
parameter and why do I want to do that
because in tag manager I have something
at my disposal called variables and
variables allow you to see specifically
things that are being tracked so in this
case I choose page path okay so page
path is a URL and why did I choose page
path as my variable for the parameter
label because if somebody does click on
the header donate button and the header
donate button on our website is on every
page so if I go to the children's page
I'm still going to see that header
donate button and so for me I want to be
able to see what page somebody clicked
on that head or donate button and so
this allows me to actually see in Google
analytics what page somebody clicked on
the header donate out button and so now
if I go back to GTM Google tag manager I
have a category I have an action and I
have a label which is a variable okay so
note that in Google tag manager you have
a lot of different variables at your
disposal and variables are there to help
you identify specifically what is being
tracked so take a look at all the
variables at your disposal in tag
manager in this example I'm using page
path so now once you set up your tag
pretty straightforward again tag types
Google analytics track type is event you
are assigning the category action indoor
label endoor value you're changing or
leaving the default in place for
non-interaction hit and then you're
choosing the variable for Google
analytics which is your property ID so
once you've done that you have a tag the
second part of setting up a tag is to
assign a trigger to that tag so tag
manager needs to be able to know when to
fire that event and so here I'm going to
look at a trigger I've already set up
for this particular event and so if I
click on it I'll be able to see that
what it is is a click on some links not
all links but some links I'm actually
saying Hey Google tag manager fire this
event when the click ID equals header
donate button now it just so happens
that if somebody did click on this
donate Now button they're going to go to
another website in this case Network
forg good.com so in tag manager I could
have set the trigger to equal URL equal
instead of Click ID I could have said
URL equal networkforgood.org
in this case I decided to go with the
click ID and so in this case that button
has an ID associated with it called
header donate button so if you wanted to
use click ID for your event for your
button you could simply just go go to
the website you can rightclick on that
button and click inspect element and so
when I actually inspect the element I
can see now the button here you can see
it's highlighted in the upper Pane and
in the lower pane I can see where it's
linking to it's linking to network forg
good.com but here you can see if I hone
in a little I could see ID equals header
D donate Das button so that's the click
ID notice there's also a class I could
have set the trigger
to equal this class or again I could
have set the trigger to equal the URL or
the page that this button is pointing to
I could have chosen any one of those but
I decided to go with the ID so this is
the ID I chose and that's the ID I have
in my trigger okay so that is what's
going to fire that event so if somebody
clicks on a button that equals header D
donate-button it's going to fire that
event which is going to equal category
head or donate action click and then the
label is going to be page path so now
that we've set up our event we want to
test to see if it actually works so
there's two ways to go about testing an
event and the first way is through
Google analytics so if we go to Google
analytics and then we go to real time
okay we can go to events and here you
can see one is already fired so let's go
ahead and go to and test this and go to
the website so if I go here for example
and I click on amagar alumni okay so if
I click on that you can see I'm under
our family and if I click on that button
then go back to analytics and look at
real time I should be able to see this
event fire so if I click on it I'm going
to go to network for good now if I go
back to analytics here in real time
under real time under events per second
I can see that event firing category
equals header donate the action equals
click now if I click on the category
here I can see the label the label
remember was page path and here you
could see this event fired on the r
family page which was the page I was
just on so that's one way to test to see
if your event works and in this case
analytics recog the event so it works it
fired and so therefore it's going to
show up under Behavior under events you
can go under overview or top events okay
and what am I going to look for in this
case I'm going to look for head or
donate okay if I click on head or donate
as my category I'm going to be able to
see my action and if I click on action
I'll be able to see my label in this
case homepage and then later on when the
data propagates in analytics I'll be
able to see under label the page that I
clicked on that head or donate button
which is SLR family okay the second way
in which you can test to see if an event
fires is if you preview so if I click on
preview in tag manager okay I'm going to
go into preview mode okay and preview
mode allows you to see in analytics and
tag manager and on the website what tags
are firing so here I could see I'm in
preview mode now so I'm going to go to
the website and I'm going to refresh and
in my browser same browser I'm using for
tag manager I can see the tags that are
being fired on this page already okay
cuz I'm in preview mode so here I can
see remarketing I could see page views I
can see Google optimize you can see some
tags that are already firing on this
page now if I click on this button here
by holding down my shift command and
then click on that button I'll be able
to see that the tag fired in preview
mode there's my event header donate and
I can see it fired so now I can see it
fired in the preview mode so in addition
to Google analytics in preview mode I
can see that that tag is fired and I
know that it's working so there you have
you have two ways to test to see if the
event fires again you have real time and
Analytics
okay so in real time if you just go up
to real time all you need to do is go
down to events go to your website click
on the button if you see it firing in
real time then you know it works the
second version or second way to test
your event is through the preview mode
okay if you see it firing in preview
mode then you know it's also working
okay so let's rehash our steps first
step is we want to be able to identify
what we want to track okay so it could
be this newsletter sign up it could be
click on a Facebook it could be anything
we want to be able to track an image I
click on a CTA button whatever we want
to track identify it second step
identify the category action and label
because that's what's going to show up
in Google analytics remember label is
optional variable or excuse me value is
optional third step go into tag manager
actually set up your tag and your
trigger so if you set up a tag and it's
an event name it g- events that way you
can see in your list of tags and tag
manager what event tracking you have
already set up so when you set up your
tag you set up your trigger your trigger
is based on logic that can be a URL it
can be a click ID it can be a class ID
whatever you want to use to fire that
event and then once you do that you want
want to test it you could test it in GTM
or you could test it in Google analytics
if it doesn't fire you want to tweak
your trigger if it does fire then great
and then one thing I would recommend is
if you're setting up various events for
your website as a best practice what I
would recommend is set up a spreadsheet
and in that spreadsheet you know you
want to put a note what's firing what
are you doing to fire it could be in
this case when somebody clicks on the
donate Now button and the header you
want to put the tag name in here the
type okay then you want to record your
category action and label and then the
great thing about events is you could
turn those events into goals and that's
a simple as going back into analytics
okay so if I go in analytics and I go to
admin and I go to goals if you set up a
new goal okay all you need to do is
choose custom click continue you're
going to choose use event as your goal
name and then from a naming perspective
in Google analytics for your goal I
would definitely put event first and
then click on header donate okay so if I
click now continue what is my category
it's equal to header donate my action is
click and so I can verify to see if this
is working and here I can see in
analytics that the goal would have a0
22% conversion rate so that tells me
that the goal is working and I can turn
this event into a goal and when you turn
something into a goal and analytics then
you can measure it across all dimensions
that's what I would recommend if the
event is equal to a kpi or business goal
or it's of importance it's something you
really want to measure okay if it's just
a click say on a Facebook button I
wouldn't recommend setting that up as a
goal okay so once you've set up your
event you're recorded it in your
spreadsheet it's firing you want to be
able to then go back into Behavior back
into events okay you can go to top
events okay so top events tell you by
category as a default what events are
firing or what category is firing the
most okay so if I choose my date range
here I can just go here to date so here
I can see my header donate button
fortunately for me has the most total
events now notice in analytics you also
see unique events and so the difference
between unique events and total events
is that unique events are equivalent to
one per session where total events means
that somebody can come to your website
initiate a session and click on that
button multiple times in the same
session so if I go to the AMA Foundation
website okay I can click on that donate
Now button three or four five different
times in the same session so what
analytics is going to do is actually in
that session count it once but
accumulate the number of clicks as a
total event for that session so you're
always going to have more total events
than unique events because in some cases
users May click on the button more than
once in the same session and so here I
can see total events unique events and
if I added a value to that event I
should be able to see it here so if I
added a dollar as an example to this
particular event because it had 164
unique events I should be able to see
164 as my value but since I see Zero
that means that I did not assign value
and so average value basically is just
giving me how much average I have per
event so it's taking into account the
number of or the value the total value
divided by the total number of unique
page views or sessions and so because I
don't have value I'm not going to have
average value but here you could see
because value is optional here I can at
least see how many events or how many
clicks I receive for particular button
again it could be a video if I clicked
on this video as an example I can see
how many people actually started it I
could see the unique and the total
events and if I click on layer lab if I
have a label assigned then I'll be able
to see what page triggered that event so
if we go back again to our header donate
button back to category we click on
label as our primary Dimension here we
can see the homepage had the most unique
events Then followed by the children's
page the contact form Etc so what you
can do in analytics you can also look at
the pages that have driven events so
here I can see the homepage has
accumulated the most total events
followed by the contact us so that's how
you would look at the data in Google
analytics under Behavior under events
and then under top events or overview is
where you can start analyzing your event
tracking so first you need to do
identify it assign a category action and
or label set up that tag and Trigger
once you do that once you test that it's
working this is where you're going to go
to analyze the data let's start out with
Y GTM so let's just say you're Sam and
you have your own eCommerce website and
you want to understand how people are
interacting with your website well Sam
today's world of websites contain a lot
of interactivity everything from videos
to PDF downloads to commenting to form
submissions uh to all sorts of chat
functionality and activity going on
throughout the website so there's just a
lot that you need to track outside of
just page views and so really what GTM
does is they help you track all these
things I just mentioned everything from
somebody clicking on the play button of
a PDF to somebody clicking on the submit
button of a form to somebody entering in
something on a chat function so that's
what GTM is so why GTM because it helps
us track all that interactivity so all
GTM is is really allows you to really
place a piece of java code which is just
script and the script that's added to a
web page to collect information so
that's really what a tag is it's just
some script that gets put on a web page
in order for you to collect information
like page views clicks Etc and they send
it to third party tools okay so that's
what GTM does it it basically allows you
to take all the tags that collect
information and you can use them in GTM
so if you want to for example collect
how many people you know enter a chat
functionality and start chatting well
you're going to take that script and
you're going to put it in GTM and GTM
will then allow you to start tracking
that information so that's really what
GTM is it just allows you to put tags
into a container or think of it as a toy
box you have all these toys and you want
to track well you can put all those
those toys or tags in a toy box or
container and we're going to talk a
little bit more about that but before we
get into GTM let's just say you know
you're communicating with your developer
and there's a new user request on your
web page and you want to update the tag
well your developer considering it's
probably a small update to your website
it's probably going to not um hesitate
and is going to go ahead and turn around
and do it normally and so normally what
happens is the developer is going to go
to the website and update the tag well
what if you have a few things that you
want to track all those things I
mentioned before from downloads to
clicks to you know somebody checking out
to watching a video well your Web Master
your web developer is going to go well
hold on a second now all these requests
are going to take time I need to put
them into the work CU so to speak well
what happen happens is when they go into
work CU usually it's going to take some
time and in some cases you as a marketer
need to launch a campaign and you want
to get that tracking uh added to the
website in time for the campaign launch
so you want to go ahead and quickly turn
around the tracking for that particular
campaign let's just say you're launching
a campaign and you're sending people to
a landing page that has a form
submission and you want to be able to
track how many people click on the
submit button of that form submission
well if you need to turn that around
your developer is like well I need to
put that in a work cu the timing isn't
going to always work out between you and
your developer is my point and so that's
where GTM comes in because there is a
solution update your tags faster and
that's Google tag manager so when we say
GTM that's what GTM stands for a Google
tag manager it's a place for you to add
tags quickly and easily so tags remember
are just Snippets of code that allow you
to track things on your website
interactivity interactive actively and
basically when you have GTM you can
buypass the webm and do it quickly and
easily so that's what GTM is all about
so why GTM because we just identified
two benefits one you could track all the
interactivity on your website and two
you can bypass your web developer or Web
Master and so that's the benefit of GTM
so the benefit you get those tags
updated very quickly via Google tag
manager okay so that's what tag manager
is so what we're going to talk about
today is specifically what tag manager
is and what it does we're going to list
some of the benefits of tag manager
we're going to show you how it works and
then we're going to show you how to get
started with tag manager tag manager if
you're not familiar with working with
web Masters and dealing with JavaScript
and tags and all this jargon is just new
to you today okay well don't fret sit
back we're going to take it slow this is
an introduction into Google tag manager
again let's start out with what is tag
manager so we've already introduced it
to some degree because we already
introduced it as a tool where you can
put all your tags into a toolbox toy box
or container so to speak right and we
already already mentioned that hey you
can bypass your web master so you're
probably thinking well if I'm if you're
not familiar with tag manager how can I
bypass my Web Master well first it's a
free tool and it's a Google tool hence
the name Google tag manager and it helps
you really that's the main point is
deploy and track tags on your website by
passing your web master so that's tag
manager and so examples of tags that can
be deployed via Google tag manager are
numerous these are just some examples
like Google analytics Facebook's pixel
tracking or Google ads There's No Limit
into the number of tags you can track
and tag man manager there is no limit
you can add any number of tracking tags
and tag manager okay so some of the
benefits well again I we just listed two
you can put any tag into tag manager and
track that onto your website and we know
you can bypass your web developer or Web
Master and what it also does is it also
allows you to test and deploy your
JavaScript codes quicker so remember
these JavaScript codes or Snippets of
codes are are just there to track
certain things on your website whether
that be a page view or somebody clicking
on a play button or tracking somebody
who converts or even just goes to your
website so the biggest benefit is you
can take that snippet of code let's just
say Facebook let's just say you're doing
Facebook marketing and you want to put
that Facebook pixel on your website so
that you could track people who come
from Facebook and convert well you don't
need to put that Facebook pixel on your
website you can go right to tag manager
and you can put that snippet of code
right in tag manager really quickly and
the other benefit here is all tags are
managed in one place and that's that to
me is really a good benefit because when
you start adding tags on your website
and you have some tags and tag manager
it just gets very confusing so ideally
all the tracking code you have on your
website needs to be in tag manager think
about that all the tracking so if you're
doing Bing or you're doing Facebook or
you're doing Twitter or you're doing
link Linkin and you're doing Google
you're doing all this type of marketing
on all these different platforms you're
going to have tracking code for all
these different platforms and instead of
putting all that code on your website
return going to slow down the slow low
time of your web page and website you
want to put them all in tag manager so
they can be organized and you know
exactly what you're trying to track and
the other great benefit of tag manager
is there's a versioning control so let's
just say you have added tags to your
website
via GTM for the last 6 months well and
let's just say you add another tag
yesterday if you added that tag
yesterday and something doesn't work
well you can just roll back to a
previous version It's that simple so you
have versioning and that's that's a good
thing when you have versioning you can
control what gets published and if
something doesn't work after it gets
published then you can roll back to a
previous version so it's a a piece of
mind so to speak just because you've
added code to your site there's no
guarantee it's going to work and so you
can always control what version you're
dealing with in tag manager and we'll
talk a little bit more about that so the
biggest benefit here to me with tag
manager is you have event tracking and
so we talked about some of the things
you could track on your website from
videos from play buttons to somebody
clicking on the stop on the video or
pausing it all the way to somebody again
chatting or let's just say somebody
clicking on that purchase button on your
website okay and you want to track all
the these different things these
different interactivities and buttons
well event tracking is what you're going
to use to track all those buttons and to
me this is the biggest benefit of tag
manager and I'll show you some examples
as we go along and if we didn't mention
it already I'll mention it again it is
free tag manager is free there's no
limit so once you have tag manager going
you can add as many tracking codes as
you want there's no limit on the number
of tracking codes you can add to tag
manager okay so it's it's free and you
can use it to its fullest Advantage okay
so it's also high security meaning that
it has different levels of permissions
okay so you can have uh somebody just go
in and look at the different tags and
tracking codes you have in GTM or you
can ask somebody who is very familiar
with tag manager and can go in and add
the tracking code to tag manager and
then publish that tracking code when it
gets add it so those are all the
benefits let's talk about how it works
now specifically how it is tag Manager
work cuz you're like Rob okay again a
lot of jargon you know you got tags and
JavaScript and and versioning and
Publishing and all this other stuff well
I know I'm throwing a lot at you at once
but just bear with me here okay so let's
start talking about how it actually
works so you have a website okay
whatever that domain is you have a
website and there's chances are on your
website you have some form of
interactivity whether that be a video
whether that be a Blog whether it be a
form submission you have a website with
some interactivity and let's just say
you're even thinking about getting ready
to launch some type of campaign on maybe
Google or Facebook and you want to drive
traffic to your website fair enough
you're joining the millions of other
websites that are out there that have
interactivity that also Drive traffic to
the website so Inc comes Google tag
manager and so tag manager is important
because again we know we want to track
people coming from that Facebook
campaign or that Google campaign
interacting with our site so if you are
running Facebook and you are running
Google analytics well guess what you
want to put that tracking code in tag
manager so Google analytics being a
Google product works very nicely with
tag manager Facebook has its own
tracking code and but you still want to
be able to track people who come from
the Facebook campaign to your website so
you're going to get that tracking code
from Facebook and put it in tag manager
that's generally how it works so so here
information from your website is shared
with another data source through tag
manager so think about that if I add
Facebook tracking code to tag manager or
let's just say I Google analytics
tracking code to tag manager tag manager
is the one that's pushing out and doing
all the heavy lifting they're the ones
that are controlling what code gets
fired and what code doesn't so if you're
putting the code in tag manager tag
manager controlling the code think about
it that way and let's show you an
example of what that looks like so here
I am I'm in tag manager I just went to
tag manager. goole.com and here I could
see a list of tags so in our
conversation we're talking about
tracking Facebook and we're talking
about tracking Google analytics well
Google analytics is easy because it's a
Google product so here if I look at all
the different tracking code I have on my
website through tag manager let's just
take a look at Google analytics so if
you're going to use Tag manager you
might as well put the Google analytics
code in here so here I can see I have
Google analytics as a tag in tag manager
now for Facebook if I'm running a
Facebook campaign well I can take that
pixel tracking and put it in GTM as well
and here I can see Facebook pixel that
is that code is added to GTM I just
basically took what Facebook gave me and
put it into Google tag manager so you
can see I can add Facebook and Google
analytics and again I can't stress it
enough any tracking code from any
platform I can add to Google tag manager
in order to track the behavior from
those sources so let's take a little bit
deeper dive into how tag manager works
so I just showed you an example of how
you could take Facebook and Google
analytics code and put it into tag
manager but if you're not familiar with
tag manager then how do I do that well
let's talk about the structure and how
tag manager works so when you have a tag
man your account you have a container
remember I mentioned Toy Box earlier you
have a bunch of toys if they're they
code and you're tracking different bits
of code from different platforms like
Facebook think of those as toys and you
have a toy box okay well that's what
this code is and that's what a container
is the code is the code and that's going
to go into the toy box for container and
so the way tag manager works is you have
tags triggers and variables so if I take
my Facebook tracking code and put it
into a container I need to set up a tag
and a trigger okay so let's take a look
at what that is so first if I go back to
tag manager I'm going to have an account
and if I have an account I'm going to
have a container so here I'm just going
to click on an account with a container
and a container is nothing more than
what website you're adding the tracking
code to okay that's all the container is
we're just letting tag manager know this
is the website we're adding all this
code to so you have tags triggers and
variables that's the structure of tag
manager so tags are just what it says
tags what are we trying to quote unquote
tag well if it's Google analytics that's
easy here I can see I have Google
analytics added so if I click on Google
analytics here's my tag and if I take a
little bit of a deeper dive there since
Google analytics is a Google product it
integrates already with tag managers
it's pretty easy I can just choose
Google analytics then I'm going to check
page view and that's my tag now every
tag needs a trigger okay so I need to
tell tag manager how or when to fire the
Google analytics tracking code so in
this case I'm going to tell tag manager
to fire on all pages so if I get
somebody a visitor to my website
analytics is firing on all pages so
whatever page that visitor lands on
Google analytics is going to fire so
that's really what it comes down to is I
have a tag and I need to tell tag
manager when to trigger that tag that's
really what the structure of tag manager
is it's tags triggers and variables and
variables we're going to talk about here
in a couple minutes but you have a piece
of code you're going to go ahead and put
that into tag manager you're going to
tag it and then you're going to fire
that trigger so let's take take a look
at another example here if I go back
here you can see Facebook well here's my
Facebook pixel okay that's my tag so
when is it going to fire well it's going
to fire on a specific domain or
subdomain that's basically what we're
doing we're trying to tell GTM when to
fire that particular tag so those are
the three main components a tag okay
which is going to contain the JavaScript
code that you get from say Facebook the
trigger so you're going to go into tag
manager and tell tag manager want to
fire that code that's the trigger and
then you have variables and so variables
are basically just additional
information that tag manager may need
for your tag and Trigger to work so
that's what a variable is it's there to
get the tag and Trigger to fire so
variables are divided into builtin and
userdefined variables so common used
variables include say page path or page
URL or host name or click class again
they're there and these examples I just
gave you are there to get your tag and
Trigger to work think about it that way
there just that's a component and if I
go into tag manager here and here on the
left side I can see variables so
remember I have builtin and user defined
so builtin means that tag manager
already built these for me so in case I
need to get my TR to work with my tag I
can use a variable so those are built in
and then I have user defin so these are
what I Define these are what I created
and again the variables are there to get
the tag and Trigger to work okay so
that's the job of the variable the job
of the tag is to host that JavaScript
code okay in the case of Facebook or
analytics that's where we're putting our
code so here if I click on AdWords
remarketing again it's a Google product
so I don't really need to even deal with
code I'm just going to select Google
AdWords remarketing okay so you could
see GTM integrates nicely with some of
the other Google products but let's just
say you have a Facebook pixel tracking
code you're going to choose custom and
you're going to put the code here so
that's part of the tag and then the
trigger again is there to get the tag to
fire so you're telling GTM when to fire
the tag and the variable is there to
help you make sure that let that trigger
and that tag work together so that's how
all three kind of work together you need
the tag to put the code you need the
trigger to tell GTM when to fire the tag
and code and the variables there to help
you define when that tag and Trigger
should work or how it should work so
again review tags are they're just small
codes of JavaScript are tracking pixels
on your website and so tags are allowed
to manage events like scroll track and
remarketing clicks downloads files play
buttons you name it even clicks on
external links for example let's just
say you have a click uh or a Facebook uh
icon on your site and when somebody
clicks on it they go to Facebook you
want to maybe track that you're going to
create a tag okay the trigger is there
because you need to tell GTM when to
fire that tag so it's a certain
condition whether it's you know fire the
tag if the URL equals facebook.com or
some other condition so the tag can not
be created until the creation of the
corresponding trigger so tags and
triggers go together you can't just
create a tag and not have a trigger
otherwise your tag will never fire and
then the variable is there again it
stores the information when defining a
trigger or transferring data to tag so a
variable has a variety of data okay so
you pick and choose the variable you
want to use with that trigger okay so
you're making sure that by defining a
variable you're making sure that you're
telling GTM how that trigger should be
fired so let's take a look at another
example here of how all three play
together if I'm in this account I'm in
this container if I look down here I can
see Google optimize that's another
Google product so what I'm doing here is
I just chose Google optimize as my tag
it's already integrated so what does
that mean I don't even need to deal with
any code I'm just going to select
optimize well we we have the tag Google
optimize but we need to tell GTM how to
fire that and so here we're going to
tell GTM to fire it on all pages so
that's basically a very simple example
because we're firing it on all pages so
if I want to look at something specific
again Facebook here's my tag here's my
code what's my trigger well my trigger
is it's going to fire on specific Pages
how do I know that well if I look at the
trigger
here I could see the trigger is a page
view but I'm telling it to fire on this
particular host name so the tag and
Trigger go hand in
[Music]
hand so how to get started with tag
manager so first things first you have
to create that account so you're going
to go to tag manager. goole.com or you
can do a search for Google tag manager
and you're going to create your account
and then when you create your account
what's going to happen is you're going
to set up a container and when you set
up a container you have choices so you
could set it up for your website for an
app on iOS or maybe Android or you can
even set it up for exe of an accelerated
mobile page so most people by default
are probably going to set up tag manager
for their website and so when you do
that when you actually select website
what's going to happen is you're going
to get some Google tag manager code in
return and so the whole idea here is
you're going to do a swap what you're
doing is basically you're saying Okay
Google I'm going to take this Google tag
manager code and I'm going to put it on
my website I'm going to put it on every
page in my website so notice tag manager
has two scripts one goes in the head as
high as possible the other goes into the
body tag as high as possible and so what
you're doing is you're making a deal
you're putting this tag manager code on
your website and in return every code
you deal with whether that be Facebook
or analytics or optimize or remarketing
or whatever it is is going to go in GTM
okay it's going to go into the Container
you created so you need the tag manager
code on your website in order for tag
manager to work okay so when you add
this code to your website then you're
free to start adding all sorts of tags
to your container but if you don't have
this tracking code on your website then
none of the tags you add to your
container are going to work so that's
the idea behind the container and then
one thing I wanted to mention on the
account is it's a Google account so when
you create your account make sure it's
the same account you use with say Google
analytics or some other Google product
that's a good best practice is always
use the same email address when you set
up your account so that it integrates
nicely across all the different
platforms meaning you can go from say
Google analytics right to Google tag
manager and one browser without having a
log out or log in okay so when you
create the account you're going to
create your container if you choose web
then you're going to be asked to place
code on your website and when you place
that code on your website then you are
free to start using tag manager and that
means you're free to start adding tags
so if you want to know more information
about installing Google tag manager then
what I would recommend is visit the
quick start guide website of GTM so
again if you're curious as to where that
code is located in Google tag manager
well when you create an account and you
create a container that container is
going to have a specific specific ID so
if I click on that specific ID here's
where I can get my code okay so again
when I'm logged in to tag manager I'm
going to click on workspace but in the
top navigation I'm going to see my
unique GTM ID if I click on that that's
where my code is going to be located and
so again your code needs to go in the
header and there's another script that
needs to go in the body and if you're
not sure how to add the code to your
website well you can always click on the
quick start guide here okay and that'll
take you to a quick start guide page a
reference page related to Google tag
manager so let's talk about creating a
tag so once you get tag manager
installed I'm sure you're excited to get
going and create that first tag so let's
talk about how to create a tag and tag
manager so when you're in tag manager
all you need to do is basically you're
looking at all your tag if you click on
tag in the left side navigation you'll
see all your tags and there's a new
button there so you just click new and
so basically what you're going to do is
you're going to create your first tag
and so what I would recommend once you
get tag manager installed on your
website I would recommend setting the
first tag up as Google analytics so that
will get you going with tracking page
views on your website when some when
somebody visits your website okay so
ideally that's what you want to do you
want to get Google analytics as your
first tag and tag manager so what I'm
going to do is because analytics is a
Google product it's already integrated
nicely with tag manager so I'm just
going to click on Google analytics it's
going to be a page view that's what I'm
tracking and now I have to set up a
variable and so what it's going to do
it's going to ask me to set select a
variable and so what you're going to do
is you're going to select new Vari
and what you're going to do is you're
actually going to go and add your
tracking ID here that's going to be your
variable so where do I get my tracking
ID and analytics well if I'm in
analytics I'm going to go to admin and
then under property settings I'm going
to see my tracking ID and all you need
to do then is go to tag manager and
paste copy first you got to copy over
that tracking ID then you're going to go
to tag manager and going to paste it and
then that's going to create a variable
for you and then when you create that
variable you're going to see it in the
drop down here so I've already created
it and basically that's your tag with a
variable then what are you going to do
you're going to set up a trigger so see
I have some triggers already set up
you're going to see a default trigger
already set up for you and that's going
to be all pages so ideally what you want
to do is you want to select all pages in
order for analytics to fire on all pages
so that's what we're doing we're setting
up a trigger we're basically telling tag
manager hey if I get a visitor to any
page on my website then I want you to
fire Google analytics so that's
basically in summary how to set up your
first tag and my recommendation is your
first tag should be Google analytics and
when you set up analytics you're going
to have to set up a variable for the
tracking ID and so you get the tracking
ID again from admin property settings
copy and paste that tracking ID over
save it you have your variable that
variable's going to be included in with
the tag then your trigger is going to be
all pages and there you go you have your
first tag you have your first variable
you have your first trigger so that's
basically what you want to do and once
you've added that tag once you've added
that trigger then the only thing you
need to do now is basically publish the
tag and so anytime you save a tag you're
going to go ahead and submit it so that
way it gets published so again what
you're going to do is let's take a step
back here you're going to choose new tag
you're going to choose analytics from
the drop down menu you're going to
choose page view then basically you're
going to add your tracking ID so you
could set up the variable and then
basically that's what you need to do
okay you're going to add that tracking
ID and then VOA that's your tag with a
variable and then once you've do that
then you're going to click submit so
when you click submit you're basically
saying hey I want this tag to go live
now this tag and Trigger and once you've
done that then analytics is ready to go
and anytime somebody goes to your
website on any page tag manager is going
to fire Google analytics so the great
thing here is you have something called
Google tag assistant and that's an
extension that works with chrome and so
when you've actually add a tag manager
to your site or you have analytics
running in tag manager you can confirm
if those tags are firing properly so
let's take a look at how Google tag
assistant works okay so if you just do a
search for Google tag assistant you're
going to see here that it's basically
just an extension that works in Chrome
and unfortunately only works in Chrome
browser it doesn't work in any other
browser so go ahead and install that
extension into Chrome and when you do
that you're going to see this nice icon
here in your browser and now if you go
to any website and I click on Google tag
assistant and I click on enable Okay so
basically I'm loading Google tag
assistant and now once I refresh the
page I can see that this particular site
has Google tag manager installed and not
only does it have tag manager installed
I can see that it's also has Google
analytics running I have also Google
optimize running and I have Google ads
remarketing tag running in tag manager
so that's what tag assist does it allows
you to see if one tag manager is on the
site and if it is great what other tags
are firing on this particular site so
tag assistants telling me I have these
particular tags firing on that site and
they're firing within tag manager so tag
assistant is a great way to confirm if
one tag manager is on the site and two
what other tags are firing on the site
now another way you could confirm if tag
managers firing on the site is you can
go into preview mode so even before you
submit and publish your tag and Trigger
you can click on the preview mode so if
I click preview in tag manager so
basically that's going to put me in
preview mode and so what does that mean
well that means that now I'm free to go
to my website and see if those tags are
firing and so let's take a look at what
that looks like so if I go to the
website and just click refresh then
what's going to happen is tag manager is
going to load in preview mode just as
you see here okay so that's going to
take a second couple seconds to load up
and now what can I see in preview mode I
could see that I have GTM firing but I
also have some other tags fir on this
page remarketing I have Google analytics
I have Google optimize I have some other
tags firing as well and so the preview
mode shows me what tags are firing On
Any Given page and I can also see what
tags did not fire okay so here I have a
number of tags already in GTM but they
didn't fire on this particular page so
let's just say I clicked on the Donate
Now button I'm still in preview mode so
I'm going to be able to see what tags
fired now I could see I have a couple of
tags that I've fired on this particular
page and then I can see what tags did
not fire on this page okay so that's the
preview mode you can use use the preview
mode before you even submit a tag and
Trigger to see if it fires and that's
the great benefit of tag manager so if
you're not sure if something's going to
fire or not then you can always go into
preview mode um and if you are sure it's
going to fire then you can go ahead and
submit it so you can leave preview mode
and just go ahead and submit that
particular tag and Trigger so here I'm
going to leave preview mode and now once
I'm done and I'm sure the tag is going
to fire and go ahead and submit all my
changes that I've worked on in terms of
setting up tags and triggers so that's
really GTM in a nutshell so I have my
tags okay my tags are just Snippets of
code that I'm going to put in whether
that be Facebook or vent tracking or any
other Google product like optimize or
page view then I have my triggers my
triggers are there to tell GTM when to
fire that tag and the variables are
there to help those tags and triggers
work together so remember that
particular variable we set up for Google
analytics okay so here it is right here
because we want to tell GTM what
property to specifically fire in Google
analytics so that's why we set up that
variable but there are all sorts of
variables Google tag manager has built
in or variables already created for you
or you can specifically Define a
variable so variables are there to help
the tags and Trigg work together so when
you set up a tag you set up a trigger
you use a variable you can always go
into preview mode preview it by going to
the website seeing if it fires if it
fires then voila you can go ahead and
click submit and that will publish the
tag and Trigger and you're good to go
that's pretty much how tag manager works
and again I can't stress that there's an
unlimited number of tags you can add to
tag manager there's no limit so you got
everything from anything from Google to
non Google to event tracking okay to
Facebook to anything that you want to
track you want to be able to put into
tag manager and again there's versioning
that's one of the great benefits of tag
manager so if I want to go back to an
older version I can simply do that so
here you can see I'm on version 32
that's how tag manager works and I can't
stress that you know tag manager is is
there to help you track interactivity on
the site because if you have a site
that's interactive that has a video that
has a download button let's just say you
know you have all sorts of newsletter
signups Facebook YouTube buttons on your
website just like this website does and
you want to be able to track how many
people click on that particular button
well you're going to need tag manager
and when you have tag manager you're
going to be able to track all of these
button clicks and interactivity on your
website without tag manager it's going
to be hard to do that so that's an
introduction to tag manager in the age
of digital marketing it is very easy to
get lost in the sea of information if
you are a beginner you will probably
spend a lot of time reading and

tools next we discussed user behavior
and competitor analysis tools and
finally we discussed the communication
tools greetings everyone this is Rob
Sanders from Simply learn happy New Year
and today we're going to talk about
digital marketing skills so digital
marketing allows business owners
regardless of the business nonprofit
for-profit large or small National local
International to really expand their
business allows them to personalize
their content they could save money and
most importantly they can measure the
results and so that's what we're going
to focus on today when we talk about
digital marketing skills focusing on
measuring the results so so suppose
anybody wants to work in marketing or
grow a company or help grow an
individual's company or ensure to keep
up with the appropriate skills this is
what we're going to cover today so we're
going to cover a few channels and so
let's get right to it today we're going
to start off with search engine
optimization or
SEO also known as organic search so
SEO is an interesting channel uh it's
probably the premier channel for most
companies in fact HubSpot confirms that
57% of B2B marketers stated that SEO
generates more leads than any other
marketing initiative so it's really
important for not only just generating
traffic but it's also important for
generating leads and and generating more
business including e-commerce and so
what does SEO entail and what skills
should you acquire in order to manage
SEO as a marketing channel well if you
think about it SEO is really divvied up
into two pies one piie is called on page
the other Pi is called off-page and so
on page consist of things you can do to
the website to help you be found in
organic search so what are those things
well it could be anything from you know
page load speed to four four errors to
sit maps and so the point here is if
you're going to manage SEO and you know
that you got to make sure your websites
in tiptop shape or your client's
websites in good enough shape for Google
to recognize it as a legitimate site you
have to have some technical skills now
I'm not saying you have to be developer
but at the same time you have to know
what a 44 eror is you know have to know
where and how to generate a site map and
upload that site map you need to know
how to edit a robot's text file so those
are you know what I call soft technical
skills but they're all valid for SEO so
you have to have some technical
background staying in the on page P okay
you need to make sure you have not only
skills to write content but skills to
optimize content so you need to be aware
of all the different elements on a page
in order to optimize that page
so again that entails you know some
copyrighting skills but more importantly
and probably more challenging is to take
those copyrighting skills and enhance
them for SEO okay so making sure that
you're able to understand what it is
that you need to do to get a page
optimized so it can rank higher in the
search engine results okay so those are
on page
skills then you got the other p piece of
the pie which is off-page so
understanding you know what it takes to
make sure your site is relevant so it's
understanding different metrics off page
metrics like page Authority domain
Authority external links internal links
and so generally most SEO managers have
a thirdparty SEO platform that they work
with like SCM rush or MZ so it's
understanding how to work with those
platforms to measure off page results so
we always say that SEO as a digital
marketing channel is an 800B gorilla
well it is because you have on page and
off page to worry about so the two of
those together you know is is quite a
task in order to rank and so what brings
SEO and all digital marketing channels
is understanding the metrics and
understanding what you're seeing in
order to measure results and improve
upon those results
okay so that's really the theme for all
these digital marketing channels we're
going to talk about today it's really
about okay what metrix and how do I
measure the results and so when we look
at SEO in terms of measuring results on
the onpage side okay you're going to
have to do some keyword analysis you're
going to have to understand okay what
volume is you're going to understand how
to get the competition numbers okay and
you're going to have to understand what
key words to choose
okay so that in itself is a skill being
able to choose keywords based on several
metrics then you're going to have to be
able to ascertain you know what pages
and what keywords are driving traffic
and how those pages are
performing okay and then again the off
page you got different metrics like
domain Authority or page Authority you
have external links internal links you
have no follow and follows and and you
lot these little metrics related to
off-page SEO you're going to have to
understand what those metrics mean and
if you can to understand what those
metrics mean and then more importantly
act on those metrics then that's what's
going to help you improve your results
in terms of SEO so again that's going to
be the common theme here so I'm just
going to highlight again those metrics
that you're going to need to understand
in order to better manage SEO a channel
again on the on page side you need to
understand the technicality is involved
but for example page load what's a good
page load time what's a bad page load
time from a keyword perspective what's
good volume what's bad volume what's
good competition what's bad competition
so if you can understand the intricacies
of the measurements related to SEO then
that'll help you improve upon this big
Channel called organic search so SEO is
the practice of getting relevant traffic
to the website okay from organic search
results so it really is essential to
stay up to date and have a complete
knowledge of the latest algorithm
updates and factors that affect search
engine ranking okay so that's SEO let's
transition to search engine marketing
also known as paid search sponsored
search Google ads Bing ads payperclick
cost per click a lot of acronyms a lot
of ways to describe it at the end of the
day search engine marketing means that
hey you as an Advertiser have the
ability and have the opportunity to rank
at the very top of the Google search
results now it's different than SEO
because you're actually paying for the
placement and so to be found at the top
of the search engine results as a paid
placement or sponsored ad means that if
somebody clicks on your ad you're going
to pay Google X amount okay so unlike
SEO sem is very fast
moving and so when we talk about fast
moving we mean that you're collecting a
lot of data very quickly so sticking
with the theme of what skills should I
have for search engine marketing well if
you're going to collect data then that
means you need to measure the results of
that data and so sticking with our theme
of measure results you need to
understand first and foremost most what
all the different metrics mean related
to centr Eng and marketing okay so I'm
just going to Rattle off if you will a
few of the metrics but the commonality
here is yes you can learn what those
metrics mean but you have to act on
those metrics so one of the the main
metrics involved with search engine
marketing is Impressions so impression
is just basically how many people have
seen your ad okay so if your ad shows up
on the search results page regardless of
whether somebody clicks on it or not
you're going to get an impression okay
so if you're getting a lot of
Impressions that means a lot of people
seen your ad what's a lot of impressions
well it's objective okay so it could be
a thousand Impressions or 10,000
Impressions at the end of the day that's
how many people have seen your ad now
more
importantly you have another metric
called clicks clicks means how many
people actually saw your ad and then
clicked on your ad okay so if you have
100 people that have seen your ad and
one person who clicked on your ad then
you have a click through rate of
1% now when it comes to Google ads and
search engine Marketing in general you
want to have a high click through rate
especially on Google because that does
impact quality score so quality score is
another metric you need to be aware of
okay so quality score is simply a number
between 1 and 10 that's assigned to each
keyword okay so what impacts quality
score clickr rate is one of the factors
that impact quality score so if you
have 200 or 300 or 500 or a th000
impressions in very little clicks that
means your click the rate's going to be
low if your click through rate is going
to be low then your quality score is
going to be low and in order to pay less
to Google you need to make sure that
your quality score is good so you need
to understand the factors involved with
quality score you need to understand
Impressions clicks click the rate
because if you don't have a good click
the rate then how do you improve that so
it's about measuring the results and
acting upon the results those are the
skills involved with search engine
marketing and that's just on the click
side you got the conversion side of the
house so you need to be able to
understand how to get
conversions and how to maintain a high
conversion rate so for example if you
have 100 clicks and only one
conversion that is a 1% conversion rate
okay fair enough but what are you paying
per conversion what's the cost per
conversion okay and if that number is
high like say $20 and you're only
selling a product that's say
$10 well then you got a problem and so
there's a lot of different metrics
involved with search engine market and
you're collecting this data very quickly
so you need to be able to react to the
data that you see
so that's the skill set really involves
search engine marketing if you're
getting the data if it's a low click the
rate or low conversion rate or high cost
per
conversion or very low Impressions you
need to be able to understand how to
react to what you're seeing and what
data you're collecting that to me is the
primary skill bottom line with search
engine marketing and there are other
skill sets involved don't get me wrong I
mean it's nice to be able to write copy
because is with search engine
marketing typically the ads have very
few characters involved so you need to
be able to write a compelling ad to
convince somebody to click on your ad
and so writing Copy being able to
understand your target
audience um those are all things
involved with managing search engine
marketing but really the key component
here is again measuring the results okay
let's switch over to traditional
marketing channel email marketing you
know one of my favorites you know listen
we're all bombarded with
emails uh and you know what it it
becomes cumbersome at times I mean it's
easy to just justreg an email and so to
me the key here if you're going to do
email
marketing you need to have a certain set
of skill sets and so what that skill set
is is really understanding your audience
because if you send an email to a
certain set of recipients you need to
hope that that email is relevant to that
audience okay so you need to be able to
really identify who it is we're sending
this email
to and a recent study done by
statista uh stated that 49% of consumers
really like to receive promotional
emails from their favorite Brands so if
you have a very strong brand then email
marketing is probably a good channel for
you if you don't have a strong brand or
nobody really knows about your brand or
your product or your business then email
marketing could be a little bit of a
steeper Hill to climb if you will but
really email marketing is it involves
emails that promote the brands products
and services and if you could Target the
Right audience or makeing sure you have
the Right audience then you got a good
chance of having successful email Market
campaigns but when it comes to emails
you know it's like having a blank canvas
you can be as creative as you want as
long as you're talking to the audience
so the big skill set here again is
copyrighting and having some you know
creativity involved with that
copywriting saying the right things but
not saying too much at the same time
making the email aesthetically pleasing
as possible so that when somebody does
open the email they're going to be able
to react to it so you know writing copy
with strong call to action or really
relevant copy that really talks to the
audience I mean those are all keys for
email marketing in my
opinion also one thing we didn't bring
up in search engine marketing but it
certainly holds true with search engine
marketing as well as email marketing and
that's AB testing and so AB testing is
simply taking an original and creating a
variant and testing the two to see which
one performs
well you could certainly do AV testing
with email marketing that means taking a
subject line that has traditionally
worked for you or is relevant for that
audience and then creating a variant or
different subject line so if I'm going
to send an email to 100 people I'm going
to send
50 people one subject line and then the
other 50 is going to get my variant
subject clim and why is this important
because I want to be able to see what
people to react to
okay so if I see the open rates higher
for the variant versus the traditional
or the original subject line then I know
that this subject line works and
therefore I'm going to apply this
subject line moving forward and then
what am I going to do I'm going to take
it and test it against another variant
so you should always do AB testing on
subject lines so the concept of AB
testing should not be lost on any
digital Mark okay whether that B SEO
search engine marketing or email
marketing okay so you should have an
understanding of AB testing and of
course going back to measuring results
with email you have a different set of
metrics we already mentioned open rates
so if you send out 100 emails how many
people open the email okay you want that
open rate to be as high as possible and
then when they open the email did people
click on that CTA or any of those links
in the email
okay so you want a high click the rate
and then more importantly when they
click on a link in the email they're
going to go to a landing page you want
that person to engage with that landing
page so what's the engagement rate of
the landing page from the email okay so
it's really important that you have an
understanding of all the different
metrics involved with email marketing
and again how to react to that data so
if you're getting low open rate could it
be the subject line isn't that good
possibly that's why you have to do
testing if you're getting a low clicked
rate on the emails that could be because
the copy may not be that great or the
design or the call to action or it's not
compelling enough for the recipient of
the email and then again the engagement
rate on the landing page if you have a
low engagement rate a low conversion
rate you got to look at that and figure
out how to improve that okay so you can
apply AB test in the landing page so
there are always ways to react to the
data regardless of what campaign or
regardless of what digital marketing
channel you're working in okay so that's
the commonality here one point on email
marketing is if you're going to measure
the results of the campaign whether
you're using you know vertical response
or MailChimp or you know some other
email marketing platform you want to
make sure you have what we call UTM
tracking and if you're using Google
analytics having UTM tracking or
understanding what UTM tracking is
allows you to measure the results of
that email marketing campaign in Google
analytics so that's another skill set
you should have being able to apply your
know tracking to your digital marketing
campaigns including email okay because
if you don't it's going to be hard to
measure the results in Google analytics
so let's focus on one more marketing
channel here and that's social media so
we all know social media isn't going
anywhere it's becoming more and more
popular in fact you know offshoot of
social media is really influencer
marketing uh you know if somebody an
influencer has millions of likes on say
Tik Tok or Instagram you might want to
engage with that influencer and help you
promote your brand or your product isn't
that really what social media is it's a
platform whether that be you know
Facebook or or Twitter it's a it's a
platform to help you promote your brand
your product your services and it's a
chance for you to get to message your
user base your community perspective
clients people who don't don't even know
about your brand it's a chance to build
awareness so social media holds a lot of
different uh strategies if you will in
fact nearly almost 4 billion of the
world's population uses social media let
me see there's seven something billion
people in the world well that's a large
percentage the majority of the
percentage of the world uses a social
media platform okay in fact just like
SEO where you need an SEO platform there
are plenty of social media platforms
there's later there's Sprout social
there's HootSuite there's buffer in fact
buffer confirm confirmed that 73% of
marketers believe social media marketing
has been somewhat effective or very
effective for their business and that's
promising because social media in my
opinion having been in this industry a
while it can be a very fickle Channel
meaning if you're trying to promote a
product or service on
Facebook and it's very very going to be
very hard to pull that person away who's
engaged with their Facebook feed not
only just to get them away from the
Facebook feed onto your website but then
to turn around and allow that person to
try and
convert okay based on what you have on
your website so it's challenging enough
just to get them away from the social
media platform let alone converting so
that's why when I say very fickle but
you know somewhat encouraging if buffer
is telling us that marketers believe
that social media marketing can be
effective and it can be effective you
just have to the right strategy so to me
one of the skill sets you should have if
you're going to be a social media
marketing manager is being able to
understand you know what is the strategy
here what are we trying to
achieve when we set up a social media
platform or enact a social media
campaign okay and so that's really the
first thing it's really understanding
what platforms what's the strategy here
because if the strategy is brand
awareness
then what channels or social media
platforms if you will work best for us
is that Twitter is that Facebook so it's
being able to kind of formulate a
strategy a plan if you will for social
media marketing because the last thing
you want to do as a marketer is
endlessly just post content for the sake
of just posting content because just
like any other marketing channel you're
going to have
metrix and social media is not Shock on
the metric front Okay so you have
reach you have Impressions you have
engagement rate in fact every social
media channel has its own set of
specific metrics whether that be likes
followers
shares uh uh reviews Stars if you will
so it really depends on the social media
platform that you're using but at the
end of the day you need to be able to
measure the results if you're posting
let's just say on
Facebook and your whole job or strategy
is to entice engagement meaning get
people to share that particular post or
act on that post then you need to be
able to measure the engagement how many
people saw the post how many people
engage with the post okay and so just
like any other marketing channel you're
collecting data and you need to react to
that data but more
importantly it's about being able to you
know put a strategy together
first and then I would you know a skill
set I would recommend you have is
understanding all the different social
media platforms that are out there you
know I just named buffer or hoot sweet
or Sprout social they're all good in
their own right but they're all going to
have different features so to
me understanding what social media
platform works best for you you want to
choose a social media platform that you
know allows you to control what post you
schedule SCH when you schedule them how
they're scheduled what platform they're
scheduled on at the same time you want a
social media platform that's going to
help you understand the engagement that
you're getting from that
platform and you probably want a social
media platform that allows you to quote
unquote listen in if you will um what
users are you know reacting to in terms
of hashtags or what's trending on that
particular platform okay so you want a
listening tool if you will
uh as part of that social media platform
so it's understanding what platform you
want to use when it comes to social
media marketing it's understanding what
strategy that that platform is going to
help you Ena enact okay and then it it's
also that social media platform that's
going to help you understand the data so
you can react to the
data so those are all to me the skill
sets you need as a social media manager
and then an a shoot of social media is
paid social so just like search engine
marketing you can advertise on say
Twitter LinkedIn Facebook on a cost per
click basis meaning if you're showing
your ad on LinkedIn and somebody clicks
on it you're going to pay for that click
you're going to pay LinkedIn or you're
going to pay Twitter you're going to f
pay Facebook so it's understanding you
know the skill sets involved with paid
social is understanding what assets you
can have when a advertising on these
platforms you know can you use video on
LinkedIn or
Facebook um you know can you use what
type of images and you know how big do
those images need to be and can you have
wording on those images or what are the
guidelines involved with having images
as part of your
ads so having a full understanding of
the types of assets that you can run in
terms of your advertising on social
media is very important in my opinion
because it's always changing and you
want to be able to put the best asset
the best message you want to put your
best foot forward when advertising on
social media and of course when you do
advertise again a whole another set of
metrics you know how many people saw
you're at how many people clicked on
your ad how many people engag with the
landing page how many people converted
what was the cost per conversion so all
of those are metrics that we covered in
search engine marketing they apply with
paid
social so you have the opportunity on
page social you have the opportunity on
social media to to really get your
message out there it's really
understanding what kind of data you're
collecting what are the results of the
ad or the post and how do you react to
that and that's really the common theme
with digital marketing skills if you're
not a big fan of numbers you're not a
big fan of excel if you will or
spreadsheets if looking at a mountain of
data scares you well then you might want
to think otherwise when going into
digital marketing but if you want to
embrace the data then digital marketing
is really a great career because if you
can get the data and you know how to
react to the data then you can be
successful in any campaign you run
greetings everyone this is Rob Sanders
with simply learn thank you for joining
and today we're going to cover digital
Market marketing interview questions and
answers so thanks for joining again and
here's how it's going to work so we
broke out a few questions and answers uh
in different categories a lot of you are
going to be interviewing for some jobs
out there in some of the jobs maybe an
SEO manager or search engine marketing
manager or email marketing manager or
content marketing manager or social
media manager so we broke up those
questions into those areas and so that's
what we're going to do we're going to
start with SEO we're going to go through
some questions and I'm going to explain
the answers to those questions so if you
have any questions to these questions or
answers feel free to just comment right
below this video and we'll get back to
as soon as possible so let's get started
we're going to start with SEO search
engine optimization we're going to go
through a series of questions and I'm
going to answer those questions for you
okay so the first question that you
might be asking an interview is
differentiate between do follows and no
follows okay so if you taken or listen
to my SEO courses on YouTube for SEO we
we talked a lot about do follows and no
follows and and simply put I mean do
follows are just signals to the search
engines to follow the link so there's a
link on site a pointing to site B we're
going to basically tell Google Bing and
some of these other search engines hey
go ahead and follow that link now a no
follow is just the opposite so no follow
link doesn't allow the search engine
crawlers to follow it so if we have a
link on our site s site a pointing to
site B we can put a no follow tag in
there and what that's going to do it's
going to signal to the Crawlers hey
don't follow this link so in the end if
the Crawlers don't follow the link then
there's not going to be any link juice
passed and so Google Google is not going
to give you credit or give that site
credit for having a link pointing to it
or pointing to another site or from
another site and so it's all about
linking so we can control if there's
links on our site whether we want the
Crawlers to recognize those or not
simply with no follow text so just a
reminder link use is the reputation or
Equity pass from one website to another
so if you have a link on another website
and that website is of high quality
meaning their page Authority their
domain Authority is high they have a lot
of content you know they're not spammy
they're really rich and they're relevant
then you may want to make sure that the
link pointing from that site to your
site is a no follow so that way that
Google can recognize the link from that
site to your site and basically that
reputation is going to be passed on to
you okay so that's a do follow versus a
no follow and why would we do a no
follow well it depends it really depends
a lot of social media platforms like
Facebook have new follows if you have a
lot of content you may not want to be
pushing out a lot of do follows it could
actually look bad from an external
linking standpoint and so a lot of sites
are really particular about who they
want to pass link juice on to and give
credit for the link so it's a business
decision at the end of the day there's
really no hard fast rule here except
from an SEO perspective if I have a site
and I have a lot of external L pointing
outward to other sites I'm going to be
particular about who I allow the search
engine to follow and what links I allow
not to follow so here's an example of
what they look like so do follow is
simply just the hre notice the no follow
has the the tag appended to it the hre
tag with a no follow so if the search
engine's crawling your site and they see
that no follow there they're not going
to follow that link and vice versa if
there's a link on another site pointing
to yours and there's a no follow there
you're not going to get credit the
search engines aren't going to pick up
that link okay so question two what is
301 redirect and how is it different
from a 302 redirect so 301 redirects
tell users in the search engine
specifically that an original page has
been moved and this is the key word here
permanently so permanently moved we're
going to explain that in a minute so
it's just moved from one page to another
and so if we don't have a page anymore
but we have a new page let's just say
you built a new website with new URLs
you want to make sure the old page is
pointing to the new page with a 301
redirect so if a 301 redirect is
permanent then a 302 is temporary so we
want the search engines to recognize
that we have 301 permanent redirects in
place why because if we have temporary
then it might alert Google to not keep
that page in its search engine rankings
because it's temporary so why would
Google want to keep a temporary page or
even a page that is pointing to another
page on a temporary basis so they REM
May remove both pages from its index
okay but if we have something permanent
in place Google may say okay this page
is permanently linking to another page
or redirecting to another page therefore
it's stable it's permanent we're going
to keep that new page in the index and
event EV remove the old page so really
something permanent is more stable in
the eyes of the search engine something
temporary may not be as stable in the
eyes of say Google and if they don't see
it as stable then they may remove both
pages from the index okay so the idea is
we want to be found in Google search
index and we get it sometimes Pages go
away for a variety of reasons and if it
does go away just make sure you have a
new page for it and that new page is a
301 permanent reader direct okay so
question three why are back links
important in SEO well we kind of hinted
on that a bit with a no follow because
if we have a link from another website
pointing to ours and that link from that
other website is really relevant and and
has a high page and domain Authority
then it's going to benefit us and so
backlinks are important because if we
have backlinks from high quality sites
it's going to improve the credibility of
our site especially if it's a do follow
tag so the search engines are going to
recognize the relationship between the
site that has a link pointing to us okay
so it's just going to build our
credibility it's going to increase
increase our domain Authority and then
the net effect of that is if we're
credible and we have high domain
Authority then that's going to increase
the rankings of our pages and when the
pages increase in ranking then we're
going to get more of a Lon share of the
traffic for for certain keywords that
our pages are found for and if our pages
are found and getting traffic then
because we have increased rankings we're
likely going to have increased traffic
and then it's just a snowball effect so
more traffic leads to more engagement
and conversion so the whole idea for SEO
is remember you have an onpage strategy
and an off-page strategy building
external links is part of an off-page
SEO strategy and we want to make sure
that you know we are relevant in the
form of a link or in the form of content
on other high quality sites being on a
high quality site only benefits us
because again increases or D domain
Authority Google sees this is more
relevant therefore pages are going to
benefit by ranking higher and therefore
when we rank higher we get more traffic
so it's a snowball effect so having
backlinks is important because it
snowballs all the way through to
conversions okay so what are the best
practices to rank your videos on YouTube
this is a great question really great
question given the importance of videos
especially with SEO because videos are
found YouTube in itself is a search
engine so if we have a video how are we
going to get it to rank on YouTube well
first things first you never want to put
a video out there and want it to rank if
it's not engaging or informative so make
sure you go ahead and follow the best
practices of having engaging in
informative content in your video now
once you have that video in play you
want to optimize it and then some of the
key factors for optimizing the video are
you want to choose a title that has high
search volume and low difficulty just as
you would keyword for example for a web
page you want to choose a title with a
keyword in it that has high volume and
low difficulty I.E low competition okay
so you want a nice ratio there and you
know what you want to choose a title
it's going to get people to watch the
video too so it's not all about just
choosing a title just for the sake of
high volume you also have to choose
something that's relevant that's going
to be catchy as well and then with that
title goes the description so you want a
description that's very relevant to your
title okay because most people aren't
going to click on a video just for the
sake of a title they're going to want to
probably get a sneak peek via the
description of what it is so again you
want to optimize that description but
make sure the description is is just as
snazzy as the title okay you also want
to use accurate and relevant video tab
tags just as you would on Twitter or
Facebook tag these videos okay so make
sure your title tag length doesn't
exceed 100 characters because it will
get chopped off so again that goes back
to just writing something really short
and to the point that's going to grab
somebody's attention Okay you also want
to upload a captivating thumbnail
something that's relevant then that's
going to grab somebody's attention and
then again we set it similar to the
video tags we want to use relevant hash
hashtags again just as you would with
Twitter and Facebook go ahead and throw
some hashtags in there that people could
see because people search via
hashtagging and then this goes about
saying you did all the work created a
really great video it's engaging it's
informative you optimized it feel free
to promote your video on other social
media platforms okay don't just stick
with YouTube per se so the benefit here
is if you post it on Facebook or
LinkedIn or whatever platform of your
choice and it gets engagement people
click on the link go to YouTube they're
going to like it and then other people
are going to see that engagement they're
going to see how many people liked it or
how many subscribers you have so promote
your videos to help you with the ranking
of the video on YouTube so that does
play into it so go ahead and promote it
so other people can watch it like it
comment Etc and that's going to engage
other people to want to do the same so
what is mobile first indexing this is a
really important and timely question
mobile first indexing means Google's
just using mobile friendly content for
indexing and ranking websites so in
other words Google for example has two
Bots they have the traditional desktop
bot and they have a smartphone bot and
eventually everybody that has a website
is going to be migrated over to the
smartphone bot and so if that smartphone
bot goes to your website and starts
crawling what do you think they're
looking for their smartphone bought
they're looking for mobile friendly
content if it's not mobile friendly
meaning the page isn't designed for a
smartphone browser or let's just say the
images are way too large or you have to
expand the text just to read it you know
a lot of these these issues that
somebody would have just simply trying
to read something on a web page on their
mobile device Google's not going to grab
that content so you want to make sure
it's mobile friendly so it gets indexed
and so if your website has a responsive
design Google will rank your website
based on its performance on mobile
devices okay so you want to make sure
that your website is mobile friendly and
if you're in an interview and somebody
asked this question you could even take
it a step further and say look I'm going
to measure how friendly my my website is
for mobile devices in Google search
console because Google search console
has a report that will show you what
pages on your website are not mobile
friendly and it's not a guarantee but I
could tell you if I'm Google and I'm
crawling your site with my smartphone
Bob and that page or one of my pages is
not mobile friendly I'm probably not
going to index it or rank it so you want
to leverage that report in Google search
console to see what pages are mobile
friendly so that's a little bonus for
you to really impress the interviewer
who asked you this question because how
you going to know if one of your pages
is mobile friendly or not if you don't
look at a report so keep an eye on
Google search consoles mo mobile
usability report okay number six list
down the most important local SEO
ranking factors okay so organic local
ranking is just as important as anything
else in organic search because if you
have a local business you want to use
the likes of say Google my business to
show up when somebody types in you know
look for a florist or you're looking for
a coffee shop so what you want to do is
you want to create a web page for every
product and service okay you also want
to opt for your business listings on
Google my business and and there are
plenty of other local business
directories out there like Yelp for
example or Bing even has one so go ahead
and also make sure you have a business
listing as well but since Google in the
United States has a huge market share
you want to start with Google first you
want to update your nap citations on
your website maintain consistency of
your nap okay so nap is name address
phone number so you want to make sure
that that's current and consistent so if
you have a number on your website make
sure it's the same number on Google my
business okay you can embed a Google map
on your website you could certainly
optimize the metatags and content not
only on your web pages but within your
Google my business Direct Dory so you
can add your business to other local
directories like I mentioned Yelp and
then also just as important op for
reviews and ratings okay so the more
reviews the H you have the better off
you are okay so I always say this with
or with local search three of the main
factors in showing up for local search
on say Google is obviously the key word
the second is the proximity of where
that person is and then third is the
reviews so you can't really control the
proximity but you can control the
keyword and you can control the reviews
to some degree so work hard at getting
reviews for your business but at the
same time you can certainly work in some
keywords let's just say for your product
and service pages on your website but
also you can translate that over to
Google my business okay so working in
those keywords making sure your your
number your address your name they're
all consistent and and really just
spreading your the the business out on
other directories that's really all
these are really key factors for local
SEO okay so question number seven how to
avoid duplicate content getting
penalized for duplicate content so for
example if you have two different
versions of a web page you may result in
a duplicate content issue so it's just
SEO 101 you never want to have two two
or more pages with the same content so
what do we do well we can avoid avoid
this and having Google penalize us by
again setting up a 301 redirect remember
301s are permanent we can also use what
they call a canonical tag and a
canonical tag basically alerts the
search engines as to which page is the
original okay so if we have an original
page we want to point to that page with
our canonical tag and then the third
option is opt for preferred domain in
Google search console okay so if you
have multiple domains make sure you set
up a primary one in search console so
those are ways to work around it of this
three I would always go with the
canonical tags because that's just a tag
that's going to sit on the page it's
going to alert Google as to what the
original is just in case they get their
hands on the duplicate so all the pages
that have the same content are going to
have the same canonical tag pointing to
one page so again three ones are
permanent you can simply just redirect
one to the other if you end up having
duplication or you could just tell the
search engines hey this is the original
page or you can go through search
console okay number eight what are the
tactics to increase a web page speed
okay so what are some of the tactics
well when you build a site especially
for mobile you want to keep it as simple
as possible and what I mean by simple as
possible really I mean hey use a simple
website design don't get overly creative
if you will most websites all websites
have images you're not going to be able
to get around that but just make sure
you optimize your IM Imes made in other
words don't have such a large image size
if you don't need something very large
don't have it okay you want to improve
server response time and what do we mean
by that well your site's sitting on a
server somewhere you can own that server
or you can be renting it out from say
Amazon web services or let's just say
GoDaddy as your register they also have
web hosting well if you have it on say
GoDaddy server you may be sharing that
server with other businesses
and at certain times of the day other
businesses may get a lot of traffic and
suck up a lot of bandwidth what is that
going to do that's going to reduce the
server response time for your site and
so you want to make sure you have a an
idea of you know what server your web
page your website is on and you want to
be able to can have some control over
that because if your server response is
slow that's going to slow down
everything else in terms of loading in
the browser and that's not going to be
good for SEO okay optimize your code we
mean by optimizing minifying when we say
minifying we mean get rid of some of the
Redundant code if you have CSS you know
get rid of chop some of the get rid of
the JavaScript you're not using so
that's what we mean by optimizing code
reduce redirects okay ideally you just
want to have one redirect in place you
don't want to create a daisy chain so to
speak of redirecting and redirecting
after that that's never going to bode
well and it's going to slow things down
as well enable brows caching so if you
enable browser caching basically if
somebody comes back to the page they've
been on say two days ago they're
probably going to see a cach version of
that page and then opt for the content
delivery Network as well so these are
some of the ways to reduce page speed
now if you're curious about the page
speed of your website you can always go
to Google's pagee insights tool and all
you have to do is just Google pagee
insights or even just something generic
like Google page speed and you're going
to get this tool page speed insights and
all you need to do is just plug in a URL
when you plug in the URL Google's going
to analyze the URL for both mobile and
desktop and so here we could see Google
gives a score so we could see the score
for mobile and we could see the score
for desktop just by clicking on desktop
and so here I could see some of the
issues that the site may be having in
terms of page low time for their desktop
if I flip over to mobile you know here I
could see some other issues for example
they have a server static assets with
efficient cash policy now if you're not
sure what the heck that means you can
always just click on it and you can see
some specifics here and or you can just
always Google it as well uh here you got
the reduce the impact of third party
code okay so that's another thing uh
reduce JavaScript execution time so
again going back to a lot of some of the
comments we met about coding okay so
sometimes too much code or code not
functioning as well as it should will
tend to slow down the site okay so you
can use page speed insights you can
always get a glimpse of how pages are
loading simply by also going to for
example Google analytics under Behavior
okay you can go to sight speed and if
you click on overview okay Google what
Google does is they do a sampling of
pages over time and in this case based
on 89 Page views they have an average
page loow time and so you can get a
sense of how quick specific Pages load
your site overall simply by looking at
the site speed overview report in Google
analytics to get a sense of how quick
your pages are loading now there's
certain factors that do affect load time
so obviously the way the page is built
with the code the images Etc but also
the browser each browser loads
differently okay so you want to take a
look at it by browser also by country
every country has a different network
you can be in the United States and have
worse network service than you do say in
you know Co Ivory Coast in Africa okay
so it really depends on the network
you're on so and also the page every
page is built differently so you want to
get a sense of what pages are loading
quicker and which pages are not you can
simply just go to to page timings in
Google analytics and you get a sense of
what pages do not load fast which ones
do and maybe hone in on the pages that
aren't loading fast and address those
pages first okay so you have two tools
at your disposal one Google analytics
and one page speed insights okay so
let's look at question number nine here
so when should an individual Target
short tail and longtail keywords okay so
remember short tail are usually one to
two keywords very Broad in nature
longtail keywords maybe three four
keywords in a query or maybe an entire
sentence those are considered longtail
keywords so usually short tail keywords
have higher volume but also higher
competition longer tail keywords usually
have lower uh volume but also lower
competition but the great thing about
longtail keywords the conversion rate
will tend to be a little bit higher than
say a short tail because it's less vague
and more specific so you can use short
tail keywords if you're trying to drive
a lot of visitors because those keywords
are going to be vague or Broad in nature
longtail keywords are used for targeted
Pages such as product pages and articles
so if you have a specific product with a
long name you can certainly optimize
that page for that product name again
the product name may have low volume but
if somebody types in exactly that
product name you show up the chance of
you them converting are going to be very
high so you don't have to always be that
specific with the product name but try
and be as specific as you possibly can
in order to get somebody to click on
your link in the search engine results
and get them over to your site to
convert okay so those are really the big
differences short tail very broad very
vague a lot of volume but also a lot of
competition but hey if you're ranking
for short tail keyword you're probably
going to get a lot of traffic the
conversion rate may not be as high as
something say longtail where hey maybe
you're just toned in on a few set number
of products and you're not care you
don't care a lot about the traffic you
just care about getting the relevant
traffic to your site to convert okay
number 10 what are the important
elements to focus while developing a
website so we're talking in terms of SEO
okay so if somebody ask me this question
in an interview what am I going to focus
on When developing a website well the
answers are right here yes we talked
about mobile mobile is so important
because a lot of websites are going to
be indexed with Google smartphone bod so
mobile usability is very important so we
need to make sure our website is
responsive for mobile just some basic
practices when it comes to site
architecture navigation we want to have
a simple URL structure okay no overly
combersome the navigation should simply
be clean and need okay if you have five
products okay maybe you have uh in your
navigation you have something called
products with all five listed or you
have all five products in the main
navigation the key is you just want to
make it clean and neat easy for somebody
to find the the rule of thumb is if it's
good for the end user probably going to
be good for Google but if complicated
for the end User it's probably going to
be complicated for Google you always
want to create a Sit map now what is
that sitemap a sitemap is simply just a
formatted file with to that's includes
all your URLs and assets your images and
your videos they're going to be sitting
on your server as well so you want
Google or these these Bots to be able to
find your pages and assets and by the
way you want to take it a step further
and make sure you upload that site map
which is sitting in the root directory
meaning
domain.com sitemap.xml okay you want to
take that sitemap and make sure you
input that sitemap location in Google
search console that way Google search
console has a one weight ticket to grab
the elements in the sitemap another
important element to focus on while
developing a WIP side is having a
robot's text file and all A robot's text
file is it's like a lock I always say to
a house so if you lock a door in your
house nobody's going to be able to get
in that door so it's all what robots
text file is you're telling Google and
these other Bots that are coming ACR
your site what's locked and what's not
locked meaning what they have access to
what they don't have access to so you
want to be a able to make sure you have
a robots text file if you're trying to
not index specific pages of your website
because if you tell Google don't crawl
these Pages or this directory they're
not going to get crawled if they don't
get crawled they're not going to get
indexed so robots text file is an
important element to focus on while
you're developing your website and while
you're developing your website it could
be on a you know in a directory just
called new website so you probably want
to have new website as the directory in
the robotx text file and just to let
Google know don't go into this directory
cuz it's my new website I'm not ready to
go live yet so you don't want it indexed
so there are a lot of reasons to have
robots text files that's the main reason
sitemap you want Google to get these
pages and assets quickly okay you want
to make sure that your side architecture
navigation is in order you want to make
sure your site is mobile friendly and
you also want to make sure you have
content on your website that's the key
CU that's what's going to keep people on
the website and engaged and when I say
content I don't necessarily just mean
words I also mean videos I also mean
images you know something interactive
okay you want to keep people engaged
that's the key behind it trust me if if
an end user finds your side engaging
Google is likely going to find your side
engaging okay so those are good brownie
points to bring up if somebody asks you
this question in an interview so just a
recap here it's important to have a
better site structure so the Bots can
easily access and indx content okay with
a responsive design helps to make your
website mobile friendly and user
friendly would also increase the amount
of time a user spends on your website
which may improve your sit's ranking
sitemap is simply just a file that helps
search engine Bots to understand the
structure of the website okay how many
pages there are on your website and
where they located along with the videos
and images okay and then the robots text
just just instructs the search engine
crawlers to understand what pages should
not be indexed okay this is simply just
a text file and it's added to the root
directory again think like a door think
of a lock okay you can tell you can lock
whatever doors you want in your house
then give it that way so now it's time
