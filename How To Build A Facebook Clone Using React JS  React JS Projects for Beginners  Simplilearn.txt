and welcome back to another video by
simply learn this is anubhub and in this
video we will be creating a clone of
Facebook but before we begin if you
haven't subscribed to our Channel
already make sure to hit the Subscribe
button and press the Bell icon so you
will never miss any update from Simply
learn so without further Ado let's begin
and see what's in it for you here we are
going to create a Facebook clone with
the help of react.js but before we jump
to the coding part let's see how the
Facebook login page looks like we'll
open the Chrome
and inside the Chrome we'll type
Facebook
and then
let's see how the Facebook page look
like
this is the home page for Facebook app
this is the header
this is their left and the right hand
side and this is the center we're going
to create everything
so it's just log out this
and let's see the first part of this
video which is the login page
and in this we'll be creating this same
page
using the react
so without further ado
and let's just move into the coding part
I have opened the visual studio code
let's open the terminal I'm entering
Control Plus backlink
this will open the terminal for us in
the terminal to create the react project
we have to write a command npx react
first create
Facebook
Joe please enter
this will take a couple of seconds
let's just wait for a minute
with this command all the npm modules
are being installed
so with this our folder has been
installed now first we'll go to that
folder there you go
and inside that we'll write npm start
let's see
so this is how a phase react app is
shown and we'll make it as this thing
so without wasting any time let's open
our video Studio code and open that
folder that we have created this
Facebook clone
let's cut it inside this inside the
source folder we'll create a folder
called login page
inside that folder we'll create two
files
dot CSS
and one another file called
login
page dot Js
press enter inside this let's see
when the JS file will import the modules
of react by just typing import
to react editor so as you can see the
react modules are being installed in our
system
let's go to the next line and type
import
dot slash login
page dot CSS
okay
CSS
so with this command all the file is be
this CSS file is being fetched to Json
so let's create the functions for the
login page
inside this function we will create
a div
included
let's save this but before that you have
to go to our app.js and delete it
and I will write
hello
save this file remove this logo
and import
and then we also have to delete this
react image
enter
let's see what's so hello from singular
so our react project is working fine
let's move on to the Kodi part for this
and just open the file called
m.js
here we'll create
delete this
I'm just right
page
okay
let's just
save this okay
error is shown here so let's fix this
first
okay okay
and this let's delete this line
and it's like this Dave will write the
class name
and the class name for first one is
login
we'll style it after this
second layer
his last name for this will be this book
reset or not this book
and let's create another difficult here
last name and the
phase two text
let's kill this
inside this we'll write this book just
save this file
now
we'll go to this
and
in this I will write
export
okay the return function we have not put
here so we have to write return
it's like this everything will come
okay
we need to expose this file
explode default
login
save this
and inside this page I've got JS we'll
see what we have to do
okay everything looks fine in this file
but let's just import the login file
import yes okay the login page has been
successfully imported let's see it is
also control bracket type npm start
let's see what we have done till now
this little Facebook is coming on the
top
now let's go back to the video Studio
code and
come to the app.css control alt delete
save this file now let's see okay cool
we'll sell this after we'll create this
login page
now let's focus on the login page
now
we have to write
the div
which will be the title it's
set as title
now close this file also and in this
title
the
this thing will come
so we'll simply just copy it from there
and inside the folder we'll just paste
it
but as you can see here
it's in different lines so for that
we'll use the break function
how we can use it we'll just have right
here
and then
save this and let's see now
okay cool let's come in nice let's go
back to our code
inside our code we'll just write
another div
let's create now this box
or just let's just dial this first then
we'll create this container
let's just try this thing inside the CSS
part
let's just
say this
everything is safe let's just first make
sides on the body
inside the body on the context
box sizing should be
water box
diagram color should be
F0
F2 F5
and then we'll go to the log component
for this page
inside the login component will give it
a width of an opposing
after that we'll give it a height of 14.
next we'll do the display as licks
after that water is radius of
one minute
alignment should be in the center
the wrap should be headed around only
and the last one should be justified
content and
stages between or let's make it as it is
now we go to our code and see what
changes are there
so as you can see it's showing in the
center with everything just the same
let's just move on to more styling let's
now just create
Facebook text
let's make this text
blue okay the component we will be
styling in this is Facebook text
so for that let's go to the CSS filing
guide dot facebook
dot is used to just fetch the data
let's do the padding here oh one units
will be fine
okay
one ram font size should be 4am
color should be I haven't read down the
color of that

double save money
and then f
and the font weight should be more than
700 so let's just save this and see what
changes are done
as you can see the Facebook is coming
that's same only
okay nice note let's move on to the next
component
and the next component should be the
title
let's just fix this by just writing
title dot title
and inside the brackets we'll just give
it a soft
Ware

500 and see
it's coming
great
so in the same now

what's happening on our page
as you can see the whole tree has been
created
let's now edit here
and add some cool features
let's just wait for a few seconds
after that we'll add here the properties
of CSS
let's go to
property tag
inside this let's make the container
let's start with the posted one
okay
display should be grid
at that
height
so the width of this should be 80
percent the rest would be fine the line
items clicks Dot
everyone down because it would be your
weight
after that
one percent only just a week a little
different
after that let's go to our
poster
inside this poster let's add this clay
should be a legs
justify content should be space between
after that let's go do something
[Music]
let's kill it
display of clicks
after that let's begin just the freaking
tension b space between
the margin of 72 pixels and the fonts it
should be
or one I guess
from now on let's create one we can
change it also let's save it and see
if it's coming
it's great let's create a few more
things
okay
which let's
we have to add one space here also so
let's add here one space
let's see what station
no
I see
we can just make it
okay let's see I got to do here also the
editions so we can create it after a
while
let's move on to more with CSS only
let's add this
update
what's the name of this
right update it's
I did this
update
I would say it should be
going through which should be
at 400
something
that's 15 pixels save it
okay
[Music]
let's see
it's raining
it's on it and see if we can do it
we need a little more
yeah that's cool we will just do this
after a while
let's just make this right first
simply done okay fine everything looks
good
let's do some addition here on top of
that will fix it
inside this pixel
after that let's give it and this one is
completed
and it it's done
it's right now
the part is captioned it's
so many distinct on the caption
caption which one says should be
3.3
true
it should be 500
word
grab a little Creekwood
the padding lifter is important so it
give
us the same and see
it's coming
okay fine
let's see
thank you

let's add a disk read and then the like
button
okay
so this is okay
Netflix
just a very content
is around
I could be favorite
um
[Music]
let's create one like
let's try this let's give it a display
of flexibility
should be
an item Center
for the weight
would be 400
after that
let's change the size of that font
and make it a little big
let's see if we can see
it's coming like this
I think now we need to edit this thing a
little
so let's edit this open video Studio
code
fine for this let's add it here this
part
so let's do it here
inside this let's give it a huge
excuse me
okay
whatever radius of 1.5 minutes
to the margin of zero
you know let's activate it should be
here if it would be the same
enough
yes
Flex love
is
industrial it's a bad
here here I have seen the width of this
post to 80 percent this will
automatically reduce the length of that
and after that here also I have include
in the call that it should be 80 then
this left part would be
free
so
we are done with our clone you can add
some images here to make it more
attractive so with this we're having the
